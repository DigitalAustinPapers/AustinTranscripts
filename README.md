AustinTranscripts
=================
Transcripts for the Digital Austin Papers.

The Digital Austin Papers is composed of hand-transcribed XML files that we had to transform into TEI-P5-compliant XML. This data repository is structured as follows:

 *   `source_xml` The hand-coded transcripts _(source files we wanted to preserve history for)_.
 *   `teip5_xml` Programmatically generated TEI-P5 XML _(which we envision scholars re-using)_.
 *   `scripts` The perl and ruby scripts used to transform the source files into the TEI-P5 files and run validation against.
 *   `reference` The TEI-P5 DTD that the validation scripts check against
