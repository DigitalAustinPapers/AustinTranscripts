<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Have you lost confidence in all your <person_mentioned>Friends </person_mentioned>? You appear 
determined not to correspond with any don't suffer yourselves to go into
the other extreem, and distrust every one—I know, by experience,
the great bulk of them, who make the warmest Professions, are
totally destitute of sincerity, espetially if a Person happens to be
unfortunate but still, there are some few, who merit confidence.—</p>

<p>I should like to hear from you, I feel an interest in your welfare
you may depend—I should like to know how you come on, when you
calculate to go to <location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>etc—From report it appears, <person_mentioned>Young
Hammond</person_mentioned>, is in troubled water at the <location_mentioned>Mines</location_mentioned>, I hope he will have
Prudence and resolution to extricate himself with honor.— If the
reign of Terror at the <location_mentioned>Mines </location_mentioned>is to last, nothing would enduce me
to live there, I am sure nothing like enjoyment is to be found
there.—</p><barker_pb n="132"/>

<p>I am told, <person_mentioned>Mr. Bibb, from <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who left here this morning
for the <location_mentioned>Mines</location_mentioned>, has gotten a very good Gigg for sale and had you
not better purchase it of him? You will find it very convenient
in this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>. I think you had best get away your Corn from
this <location_mentioned>Village</location_mentioned>. It is not gaining in Quantity you may depend— Had
you not better get some of your Hollow Ware out also? You are
losing the Sale of it, appears to me—The 25 bars of Lead, I had
deliver'd directly to <person_mentioned>Mr. Spencer</person_mentioned>, to whom it was to go, he gave the
<person_mentioned>Teamster </person_mentioned>a Receipt for it—I have heard nothing from home, this
four weeks— What can be the reason I am at a loss to determine—
I shall make arrangement to get my <person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Horace Austin</person_mentioned> and
his <person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Pittsburgh </location_mentioned>there I calculate, you will meet the whole
<person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>and accompany them <location_mentioned>down the River</location_mentioned>—Give my love to the
<person_mentioned>Family</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>T. Phelps</person_mentioned></p>

<p>N. B. The <person_mentioned>Sqaws </person_mentioned>have done your skins, shall I sell them and at
how much?</p>
