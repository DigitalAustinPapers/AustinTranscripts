<p><location_mentioned>Hazel Run</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="07-18-1824">July 18th 1824</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I wrote you some time last week, from <location_mentioned>Hereulanium</location_mentioned>,—by the way
of <location_mentioned>Natchos</location_mentioned>, but lest that letter should miscarry,— I write again,
— I arrived at <location_mentioned>Herculaneum </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="06-15-1824">15th of June</date_mentioned>,— I also
stated to you, that I was compelled to go by the way of
<location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, and it proved a fortunate circumstance I did,—as the rains
have fallen in such torrents, that It would have been almost 
impossible for me to have got here,— I found all our friends well, that
is all that are left— I wrote you from <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>informing you
of the <hi rend="italic">death of <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned></hi>,— I found <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">well </hi>She has born her
afflictions with much fortitude and has supported herself and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>
(by her own exertions much better than could be expected 
considering the <hi rend="italic">destitultle situation</hi>, in which she was left— The 
affairs of <person_mentioned>Brother James</person_mentioned> is placed in such a Situation that It <hi rend="italic">will </hi>be
<hi rend="italic">impossible </hi>for <hi rend="italic">me </hi>to do any thing <hi rend="italic">with </hi>them, without detaining
longer in <location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>than I would be willing—therefore <hi rend="italic">I </hi>think the
<hi rend="italic">wisest </hi>plan <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can pursue, is to <hi rend="italic">leave </hi>the <hi rend="italic">damd </hi>country as soon as
possible—with <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and her <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—and leave the rest for <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to
finish should you <hi rend="italic">ever </hi>visit <location_mentioned>Mo</location_mentioned>— there are a number of <hi rend="italic">acts </hi>and
notes to be collected in this <location_mentioned>neighborhood </location_mentioned>but the estate has never
been administered upon therefore the collection of them can not be
<hi rend="italic">forced</hi>, untill that takes place— As to the <location_mentioned>Little Rock property</location_mentioned>,
when I was in <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Wm C Carr</person_mentioned> informed me that no difficulty
aught to originate respecting it—and If <person_mentioned>Ashley </person_mentioned>wished to do what
was just no difficulty could arrise—unless <person_mentioned>H. E. [Henry Elliott's]</person_mentioned>
estate should prove insolvent and his <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Creditors </person_mentioned></hi>force the Sale of that
property—in that case he deemed it advisable for <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>to file a
Bill in chancery against <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>H. E. heirs</person_mentioned>.</hi></p>

<p>I have written to <person_mentioned>Ashley </person_mentioned>on the Subject and inclose your letter—
I have also directed him to forward every thing left at the <location_mentioned>Little
Rock</location_mentioned> to the <location_mentioned>mouth of White River</location_mentioned>— I also wrote to <person_mentioned>Cunningham</person_mentioned>
to do the same which I think they will comply with, as <person_mentioned>Ashley </person_mentioned>in a
letter to <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">observed </hi>that the things were <hi rend="italic">there </hi>subject to your
Order—<person_mentioned> A Scott</person_mentioned> came up in the same Boat with me from the
<location_mentioned>mouth of White River</location_mentioned> also <location_mentioned>Mrs S.</location_mentioned> and two of his <location_mentioned>children </location_mentioned>he
fought and killed <person_mentioned>Judge Seldon</person_mentioned> in a duel, a few days previous to
my arrival, at the <location_mentioned>mouth of White R.</location_mentioned> the cause of the dispute
was owing to some assertions <person_mentioned>Seldon </person_mentioned>made respecting him— <person_mentioned>Saml
Perry</person_mentioned> is at present absent to <location_mentioned>Philidelphia </location_mentioned>but is Expected back in a
short time   I understand he is very much dissatisfied at the present<barker_pb n="855"/>
State of things at the <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Mines</location_mentioned></hi>, and I think your letter will have
considerable <hi rend="italic">effect</hi>— <person_mentioned>Price </person_mentioned>continues to persecute him and has
lately made some publications with an intention to injure him— It
is generally congectured something Serious will take place when
he returns from the <location_mentioned>Eastward</location_mentioned>— Nothing appears to excite so
much interest throughout the country, at present as the 
approaching election— <person_mentioned>Ashley </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Bates </person_mentioned>are candidates for <person_mentioned>Govr </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Wm
C. Carr</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Nathl Cook</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Evans </person_mentioned>are candidate for <person_mentioned>Lt Govr</person_mentioned>— these
elections will be warmly contested. <person_mentioned>Genl Rector</person_mentioned> has been removed
from office, by the influence of <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>David Barton</person_mentioned></hi>—this caused much 
excitement in <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned> and no doubt <hi rend="italic">"Bloody doings"</hi> will take place
on <hi rend="italic">"Bloody Island"</hi> in a short time—his <person_mentioned>successor </person_mentioned>is by the name of
<person_mentioned>McKea </person_mentioned>formerly attached to the <person_mentioned>corps of Engineer</person_mentioned>'s.—a man of
handsome tallents—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and myself will visit the <location_mentioned>mines </location_mentioned>next week when I shall see
all your old <person_mentioned>acquaintances </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>James Bruffe[y]</person_mentioned> may be prevailed
on to move to the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have not heard one word from <person_mentioned>Varner</person_mentioned>. I have therefore 
concluded not to delay any longer. I shall be at <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>by the
<date_mentioned n="10-20-1824">20th of Oct</date_mentioned> or <date_mentioned n="11-01-1824">1 of November</date_mentioned> certainly, unless you make some other
arrangement— I would advise <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to send out 2 waggons and some
spare horses— I shall take on the <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>of <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>at all hazerds</hi>
it consists of <person_mentioned>Sarah </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>four children</person_mentioned>— A <person_mentioned>Mr. Carpenter</person_mentioned> who has
been living here for some time, and who Married <person_mentioned>Polly Barfield</person_mentioned>, that
formerly lived with <person_mentioned>Mrs. H Austin</person_mentioned> she has been living with <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>
for some time past— <person_mentioned>Mr. C.</person_mentioned> is a very <hi rend="italic">good man</hi> understands 
surveying and also is well acquainted with the <location_mentioned>Missipa </location_mentioned>and will be of much
Service to me on my journey,— <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>will want some one to 
accompany her and <person_mentioned>Mrs. C.</person_mentioned> has lived with her so long that had rather
she should accompany her—they will be of no expence to me on the
journey— I have promised him for his assistance to convey him
from <location_mentioned>Natichitoches</location_mentioned>. I shall buy a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>Dearbourn Waggan in <location_mentioned>St.
Louis</location_mentioned> covered over with oil cloth to keep out the rain—and I think
one that will answer for 1. or <hi rend="italic">two horses</hi> preferable as there will be
too much of a load for 1. horse—a light one that would answer for
1. horse and put a tongue to it for <hi rend="italic">two horses on the journey</hi> is the
kind I will get— I have nothing more to say—times are extremely
dull—the <location_mentioned>Mississippi </location_mentioned>has been higher <hi rend="italic">up here</hi> by 3 feet than last
year,—the crops are <hi rend="italic">all distroyed</hi> and provisions are to be very high
and <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi>—in fact I hardly know what a great many will do—I
would not positively exchange the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>for all the land I have
seen between here and there— I informed you of the death of <person_mentioned>Aunt
Austin</person_mentioned> She died shortly after the death of <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>— She has left
a large and helpless <person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Children </person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">God </hi>only knows what is
to become of them.   <person_mentioned>Wm </person_mentioned>will go on with me—</p><barker_pb n="856"/>

<p>Give my respect [to] all my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in that quarter particly to
<person_mentioned>John</person_mentioned>— I should like to have him meet me in <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>or if
you make other arrangements at <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>—I saw a <person_mentioned>Genm </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>St Louis
</location_mentioned>who saw his <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>a few <hi rend="italic">weeks </hi>since they were all
well—  <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>sends her love—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jas B Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Horace </person_mentioned>lives in <person_mentioned>St. Louis</person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">poor man</hi> he has <hi rend="italic">wasted </hi>to a mere
skeliton and I expect is in his grave before this, an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>came
down for <person_mentioned>Mary Honey</person_mentioned> the day after I left <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned>.—the <person_mentioned>Austins</person_mentioned>
will become extint in this country in a few years—</p>

<p>[In Margins:] I could say much more but I will wait untill I
come from the <location_mentioned>Mines </location_mentioned>I am almost sure that <person_mentioned>Jas Bruffe[y]</person_mentioned> will
move, he is much dissatisfied at the <location_mentioned>mines</location_mentioned>, he and <person_mentioned>Price </person_mentioned>are also at
Swords points,   I shall do my utmost to prevail on him to move</p>

Colony</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, in the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>. Via <location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned></p>
