<p><location_mentioned>Salado </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-26-1835">26th Oct 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I wrote you the <date_mentioned n="10-24-1835">day before yesterday</date_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>since that time the 
<person_mentioned>members of the consultation</person_mentioned> who are here 28 or 30 met and concluded to leave
it to the vote of the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>whether the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>should return and take
their seat in the convention or remain untill after <location_mentioned>San Anonio</location_mentioned> is taken a
large majority were in favor of the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>returning with the exception
of those who belonged to the <person_mentioned>staff</person_mentioned>, and those who might volunteer to
remain—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Travis </person_mentioned>is a <person_mentioned>member </person_mentioned>who volunteers to remain and there are others, when
the thing was first talked of I thought it would be the means of disbanding<barker_pb n="212"/>
the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>as I heard most every one say that he would return if the 
<person_mentioned>members of the convention</person_mentioned> left <person_mentioned>Doct Archer </person_mentioned>was appointed by the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>to
address the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>before the question was put, afterwards, <person_mentioned>Genl Houston</person_mentioned>,
and then <person_mentioned>Jack </person_mentioned>and lastly <person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>who was just able to sit on his horse all
purporting the same (that is) the propriety and even the necessity of 
sending the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>back (those who were willing to go with the exception of
those belonging to the <person_mentioned>Staff</person_mentioned>) some 15 or <person_mentioned>20 men </person_mentioned>would go back any how
perhaps more</p>

<p>We are going down to the<location_mentioned> mission of the Espada</location_mentioned> to take up our quarters
—I presume we will have <person_mentioned>400 men</person_mentioned> when all have gone back who are 
dissatisfied perhaps not so many however they say with <person_mentioned>two hundred men</person_mentioned> we
can sustain ourselves in the <location_mentioned>mission </location_mentioned>we will be continually recg. 
reinforcements. and perhaps we will have <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>in 4 or 5 days what are here
have pledged themselves to stand up to the tug untill <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>is taken. <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned>
in his short speech told them that he would remain as long as <person_mentioned>10 men</person_mentioned>
would stick to him, because the salvation of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>depends on the <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned> being sustained and at the same time the meeting of the <person_mentioned>Convention</person_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>is better <date_mentioned n="10-26-1835">this morning</date_mentioned> than he has been for several days although
slightly salivated</p>

<p><person_mentioned>M. A. Bryan</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
<p><person_mentioned>Joel </person_mentioned>is well</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr James F Perry</person_mentioned><location_mentioned> Peach Point</location_mentioned> To the care of <person_mentioned>Jno. R.
Jones</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned> who will please forward this
by the first opportunity—</p>
