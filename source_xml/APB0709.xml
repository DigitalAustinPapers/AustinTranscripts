<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>In the course of six or eight days I shall finish the <location_mentioned>Leagues above
the base line</location_mentioned>, all except that part of the <location_mentioned>1st 2nd and 3rd next to the
Colorado</location_mentioned>, which I cannot conveniently do at present, there being
no water in running below the base line. I want your advice,
whether I shall run two Leagues deep or one before I come to the
<location_mentioned>head of caney creek</location_mentioned>, if I do not make two, one will be very long, some
of these that I have run are above seven miles long, the next below
the base line will be seven or eight miles long, and perhaps nine.
The <location_mentioned>Leagues we plotted for <person_mentioned>Mr. Selkirk</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> to run did not reach the
<location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>. I altered the plot and made three Leagues instead of two.
In one point more I want your advice, the course with which I have
run the seven first Leagues will not do to run the next, it runs too
much down the <location_mentioned>creek </location_mentioned>and does not come square enough to the
<location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>, the course being S 20° W. the same as <person_mentioned>Kincheloe</person_mentioned>s line. I have
been down the <location_mentioned>Prairie </location_mentioned>fifteen or twenty miles and think a S. W.
course will not suit the best or perhaps S 60° W Send me an answer
by the first opportunity, if you please, sir.</p>

<p>I would give you a history of our late <person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>fight, but the <person_mentioned>bearer</person_mentioned>
of this can give you an account of it, which will answer every 
purpose,—</p>

<p>Sir, do not forget to write to my <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>, by yours, write him
that now is the time to come to this country, and that I have secured
him a tract of land if he will come soon, in so doing you will much
oblige</p>
