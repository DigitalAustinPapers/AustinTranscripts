<p><person_mentioned>St. Louis</person_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="09-12-1807">Sep 12 1807</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have delayed very long to answer your letter of the <date_mentioned n="08-02-1807">2d of Aug</date_mentioned>,-
neither do I know at this moment, in what manner it should be
answered.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally agreed that you and <person_mentioned>Col° Smith</person_mentioned> have been
at the head of the two great <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned>, which have heretofore divided
the district of <location_mentioned>St Genevieve</location_mentioned>.— Your opponent has been dismissed<barker_pb n="138"/>
from office with as much abruptness as the decorums of such a 
measure would justify; and it appeared to me correct and proper, that
your several friends, should be no longer known, as the <person_mentioned>partizans </person_mentioned>of
their respective <person_mentioned>leaders</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>With respect to the disaffection of certain <person_mentioned>persons in your <location_mentioned>quarter
of the Country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, you must be very sensible—that I have no proofs</p>.

<p>The conduct of <person_mentioned>Colo, S------</person_mentioned>has been before the <person_mentioned>Grand Jury</person_mentioned>— Against
him there were stronger presumptions than against others, and yet
nothing was established.</p>

<p>When a <person_mentioned>Public Agent</person_mentioned> proscribes a <person_mentioned>Citizen </person_mentioned>and declares him 
unworthy of public trust the world will expect to be told of what he
has been guilty.— I have nothing but the surmises of 
[undecipherable] <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>to offer.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Major Cook</person_mentioned> has been with me—He recriminates, tho' he knows
nothing of your accusations—but permit me to assure you, that I
entertain the same high opinions of your purity of character and
conduct that I ever did—</p>

<p>With respect to a <person_mentioned>Legionary Corps</person_mentioned>—I approve the idea, and
should certainly be gratified by sanctioning such an arrangements—
but it cannot at this time be carried into effect, It shall not be 
forgotten</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. James Austin</person_mentioned> is so fully possessed of my feelings on these
subjects that he will carry them to you more satisfactorily than I
have now leisure to do—</p>

<p>F<person_mentioned>rederick: Bates</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Moses Austin Esquire</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Mine a Burton</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Jas. Austin
Esquire</person_mentioned></p>
