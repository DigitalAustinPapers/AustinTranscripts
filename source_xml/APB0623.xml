<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I expected to have visited you before this time but cannot do so
for two or three weeks—I am now endeavoring to find a place 
suitable for the <location_mentioned>capital of the colony</location_mentioned> and believe I shall fix it <location_mentioned>below
<person_mentioned>Cummings</person_mentioned> on this River</location_mentioned> at a place now occupied by <person_mentioned>Mr Bright</person_mentioned>—If
an opportunity opens I wish you would write me wheither there is
any suitable place on your <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>any where between the place<barker_pb n="690"/>
called the <location_mentioned>fort </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr. Boatright</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> I do not wish to go higher up
than <location_mentioned>Boatrights </location_mentioned>unless the situation should by its superior natural
advantages require it. I want a place for the town on the <location_mentioned>west side
of the Brazos</location_mentioned> where there is abundance of good water besides the
river, either springs or a good creek.</p>

<p>The place I have in view on this river is very well watered with
the best of springs—it is about <location_mentioned>38 miles from Castlemans</location_mentioned>, about <location_mentioned>65
or 70 miles from the mouth of this river</location_mentioned>, about <location_mentioned>25 miles from 
<person_mentioned>Boatright</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> and I suppose about 45 miles from you, and about <location_mentioned>70 miles
from the mouth of the Brazos</location_mentioned> and if the <location_mentioned>La Baca</location_mentioned> is settled will
be nearly central, but if a situation can be found on the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>more
so and a good site I will fix it there—</p>

<p>I wish you could do me the favor to select some good places for
me say about six or eight league tracts any where between <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Parker</person_mentioned>s
</location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>McFarland</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned>, or employ some one to do it and I will pay for
it—or I will pay you if your other occupations will permit. I want
good land water and timber, and if the places are not selected now
they will all be occupied. It will be a real service to me if you can
do this, and Mark them and let it be known that they are reserved—
also try and find the best place for a town up above or near you on
the <location_mentioned>River</location_mentioned>—it will be valuable at some future day, and you shall be
profited by making a good selection in <location_mentioned>lots</location_mentioned>—also I want a good
situation on some creek off from the River where there is a body of
good land suitable for a <location_mentioned>stock farm</location_mentioned>—also some good <location_mentioned>mill seats</location_mentioned> if to
be had—it is no more than just that I should have a pick as well
as others, and I have too much public business to attend to, to do
anything for myself and must call on my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>to aid me—I will
send you a regulation relative to <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>vagabonds </person_mentioned>etc. as soon
as it is copied which I wish to have rigidly enforced—</p>

<p>How do I envy the quiet life you enjoy—I have not a moment
that I can call my own, and the task before me is a very troublesome
one I cannot expect to please all nor shall I try to do it—I will try
to satisfy myself by doing justice to all-</p>

<p>It is probably I shall go to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>McFarland</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> in three or four days, to
look at that place for a town, but I am told that there is no good
water there.</p>

<p>Remember me to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Bell</person_mentioned>, your friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>I shall decide on the town in less than a week therefore if you
know of any good place send me word soon.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J. H. Bell</person_mentioned></p>
