<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Morgan of the firm of Sexton and Morgan of <location_mentioned>Alexandria</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has
just called on me relative to the debt you owe them, and says he
[expects?] to send it up to <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned>— he says they will take any
kind of property or if the debt is secured wate any length of time,
I told him I knew nothing about your capacity to pay them, but did
not think it could be paid at this time in any way—</p>

<p>If you come or send anything to this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, these debts will 
distress you, for gods sake keep beyond the reach of this <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>, for a
<person_mentioned>stranger </person_mentioned>here may lay in <location_mentioned>jail </location_mentioned>twenty years, he can not take the 
benifit of the insolvent or any other law that would releive him—</p>

<p>The vessel will return in about 60 days and the result of the trip
published, and if you could send some corn etc. to go round in her
it would be an advantage, but I do not wish you to advance any
thing that will imbarass you in any way— you have your <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>with you—take care of them I will do the best I can for
us all I will write to <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>by the Dolphin also to
<person_mentioned>Browne</person_mentioned>—I wrote to <person_mentioned>Browne </person_mentioned>to get a certificate of his and my 
residence under the <person_mentioned>Spanish Govt</person_mentioned>, and of his baptism, dont let him
neglect this— perhaps <person_mentioned>Francois Vallé</person_mentioned> and some others of the <person_mentioned>old
Settlers of <location_mentioned>upper Louisiana</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> would move, I will see that they are
well provided for if they come</p>

<p>Write me directed to the care of <person_mentioned>Ambroise Sampyrac <location_mentioned>Nachitoch</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
and pay the postage and let me know what is the State of <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>s
business, what is your real Situation— What are your prospects

any of us. When I return however I shall lay off a number of Two
League tracts and get the titles secured—</p>

years provisions and go all the way by water—their stock might
be taken by land</p>

to embrace it—but as I before said <hi rend="italic">risk nothing</hi> yet. you have but
little, and your <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>depends on that little for Support—</p>
