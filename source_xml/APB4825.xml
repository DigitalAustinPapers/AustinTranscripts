<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I expect to leave here for home this week by way of <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> or
<location_mentioned>Tampico </location_mentioned>unless I meet with <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>going by land in which event I would
go that way, as the fever is generally bad <location_mentioned>on the coast</location_mentioned> and in <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>
so late in the summer.</p>

<p>Everything is tranquil in this part of the country— <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>is to meet
in extra session on the <date_mentioned n="07-19-1835">19 of this month</date_mentioned>— There seems to be no doubt
that the system of Govt will be changed from federal to central, tho it 
probably will be some months before the new constitution can be framed and
published</p>

<p>There are many reports and falsehoods circulated here about <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.
I believe that the most of them originate with persons who wish the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>
to send the most of the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>there, so as to leave an open field for 
revolution here, in the absence of the <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned></p>

<p>This has been a very hard trip upon me, but I anticipate a quiet life
with you when I get <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned></p><barker_pb n="91"/>

<p>Keep the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>school </location_mentioned>They ought to learn Spanish. it will
always be usefull to them. <person_mentioned>Genl Santana</person_mentioned> is at his <location_mentioned>hacienda near Vera
Cruz</location_mentioned></p>
