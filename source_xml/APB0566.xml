<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Anxiously and impatiently have I waited your return but at last
shall have [to] go without seeing you. My business proved to be
so bad here that I leave this [place] in worse circumstances than I
came. I now go [to] the <location_mentioned>Acienda de los Hornos</location_mentioned> to cure the <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>,
and shall also practice some in <location_mentioned>Parras</location_mentioned>. I am not permitted to go
further on account of an order of the all wise <person_mentioned>govt </person_mentioned>but perhaps I
may break the order. They may talk of 'falta buen gobierno' but
that is not the complaint, all the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>in the world would
not make them worth the powder that it would take to blow them
to Hell—that which God made for a Jack Ass can not be educated
so as to make a fine Horse.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be hoped from this govt for a <person_mentioned>stranger </person_mentioned>be him
ever so fine. I shall set out in the morning for <location_mentioned>Parras </location_mentioned>in which place
I shall remain one or 2 months I shall keep up a correspondence
with <person_mentioned>Dn Grigorio Montañez</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>with whom I leave all the
letters from your <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>, and from whome you may learn something
concerning me a french gentleman named <person_mentioned>Francois Michaud</person_mentioned> offered
to take me home at his own expense but I would not impose on his
goodness.   I remain your ever sincere friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Andrews</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] A <person_mentioned>Sr Dn Estefan F. Austin</person_mentioned>   Presente</p>
