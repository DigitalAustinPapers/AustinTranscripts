<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="07-11-1836">July 11th 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>To Messrs. <location_mentioned>Austin</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Archer</location_mentioned>, and <location_mentioned>Wharton</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Late Commissioners of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>

<p>Gentlemen</p>

<p>Enclosed you will find a copy of an application made by me to acquire
the right of a <person_mentioned>Colonist of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, The original, I in person handed to
<person_mentioned>S. M. Williams esq</person_mentioned>, at <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>, as he, at that period was acting for <person_mentioned>S. F.
Austin Esq</person_mentioned>, my object in tendering a copy is for the purpose of obtaining<barker_pb n="396"/>
a certificate of citizenship under that date, I trust that through your 
influence the <hi rend="italic">right </hi>applied for, will be unhesitatingly granted, You well
know Gentlemen I have been strictly devoted to the interest of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>; That
through your instigation I declined receiving consignments of Merchandise
and consequently, that chance of resource was entirely cut off, Leaving me
for the present ruined in commercial prospects, which I should not value
if my credit had not been deeply injured by the unjustifyable proceedings
of your <person_mentioned>Cabinet</person_mentioned>, At the period the <person_mentioned>agency of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> was accepted by me
her prospects were so deeply shrouded in doubt that you were refused by
several the aid I promptly rendered— You will recollect one person only,
was willing to accept the office (and only one) on condition that I would
take all the responsibilities, all the trouble, and he the profit, and the
title— When I refused the proposal, it was far from my belief that a 
<person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>representing an enterprising and honorable population would sanction
the proceedings of a few treacherous, interested persons, to bring disgrace
and ruin upon the only person who disinterestedly stood by them through
their days of darkness— In a few days I trust to submit to your perusal a
correct statement of all the transactions between the <person_mentioned>Government of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>and their <person_mentioned>agents in <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>
