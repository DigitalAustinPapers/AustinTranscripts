<p>Sir</p>

<p>By the request of a very particular friend of mine, I am induced
to address you for information relative to your projected 
<location_mentioned>establishment on the Trinity</location_mentioned>—Having as yet never seen any map of the prov-<barker_pb n="446"/>
ince of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I am not able to form a correct notion of yr location-
It would be desirable to learn when you design to lay down yr grant—
Upon what terms you solicit emigration? What inducements the
prospect holds out? If, as I suppose, <location_mentioned>Galveston Island</location_mentioned> must be
made the place of deposit from whence shipments of produce are to
be made, what security the <person_mentioned>shiper </person_mentioned>could have against the 
depredations of the <person_mentioned>marauders </person_mentioned>who it is to be expected will continue to
infest that bay.</p>

<p>All these and any other information which you can give would be
thankfully received—My <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>could probably take with him about
twenty <person_mentioned>negroes </person_mentioned>and perhaps a poor white <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>consisting of a man
and his <person_mentioned>wife</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Have the kindness to reply to this directed to me at <location_mentioned>Donaldsonville [Louisiana?]</location_mentioned> 
where I shall be in a week from this time directed
to my friend <person_mentioned>Thos. C. Nicholls Esqr</person_mentioned> resident there—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>G. Pearce</person_mentioned></p>
<p>I have been informed that several vessels sailed from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>
lately for yr. establishment wi[th] persons designing to make a 
location there—If not inconsistant wt yr  views, I would like to learn
what number and character they may be.</p>
