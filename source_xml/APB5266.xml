<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Yours under date of [September 1 (?)] informing me of the illness of
<person_mentioned>Doctor Archer</person_mentioned> has been received—and I have sent you some good Claret
by <person_mentioned>Sergent Foot</person_mentioned> who goes via of <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>I have a great many little
things which I would be glad to send you and which would add much to
your comfort but I do not know or are rather am not acquainted with the
bearer.</p>

<p>I saw <person_mentioned>Mr. Perry</person_mentioned> Two days since I believe they are all well you will
no doubt have received the returns of the Election in this Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>body Politic</person_mentioned> is unlike Every other machine that Ever Existed, other
machines may be thrown out of order by some accident but this is only
right by accident.—</p>

<p>I have sent you Two or three <location_mentioned>newspapers [of] New Orleans</location_mentioned> which contain
but little. The <location_mentioned>port of Matamoros</location_mentioned> is opened, for provisions of all kinds,
and I have no doubt from what I can gather that an <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>will soon
assemble at <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>for the purpose of invading <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Edmund Andrews</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Genl Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> Near <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned></p>
