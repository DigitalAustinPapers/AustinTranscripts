<p><person_mentioned>T. F. McKinny</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>This will be delivered by my friend <person_mentioned>Dr Richardson</person_mentioned> a gentleman of 
sterling worth and high standing as a <person_mentioned>physician</person_mentioned>. I refer you to the <person_mentioned>Dr.</person_mentioned> for
information about the public opinion in this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>as to the affairs of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. There is but one sentiment all over the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> which is in favor of
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and of an immediate declaration of independence We have 
negotiated a loan on the terms of the enclosed contract</p>

<p>This was obtained on the belief that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>would declare independence
in <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1836">March</date_mentioned>—it could not have been had otherwise. The accounts from <location_mentioned>Vera
Cruz</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Tampico </location_mentioned>are that the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> have united with <person_mentioned>Santanna</person_mentioned>
against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— This of course leaves us but one remidy, which is an
immediate declaration of independence— I hope it will be <hi rend="italic">unanimous</hi>—
I wish I was there to urge it. I would do so by every means in my power.
A number of vessels are fitting out in <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Tampico </location_mentioned>heavily
armed— <person_mentioned>Santanna </person_mentioned>was at <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>some time ago and is probably at <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>before this— A storm is brewing, but it will be harmless if the
<person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>are united and come out <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> for independence.</p>

<p>There is no news of <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>, God knows what has become of him—
My health is much improved. I wish it had been as good in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—it
might have been of service to the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>if it had— There must be union<barker_pb n="305"/>
and harmony and we must all go together, <hi rend="italic">unanimously</hi>, in favor of independence.</p>

<p>Send this to to <person_mentioned>Perry </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Grayson</person_mentioned>— Love to the <person_mentioned>ladies</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Yours—<person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p><date_mentioned n="01-17-1836">Jan. 17.</date_mentioned> I have just heard that there was a <person_mentioned>mob </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> headed
by <person_mentioned>Mosely Baker</person_mentioned>— Such a rumor has injured us here— What has that
man to do with <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, or what claims has he to confidence that he
should have influence to raise a <person_mentioned>mob</person_mentioned>. Shame to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>that such things
should be— God poured upon <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>his most bitter wrath, when he 
suffered the last <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>(of most infamous memory) to meet
at all. <hi rend="italic">Years </hi>will not relieve <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>from the evils produced by that 
<person_mentioned>legislature</person_mentioned>—this <person_mentioned>mob </person_mentioned>I fear is a paragraph in the long chapter of evils which
the acts of that <person_mentioned>legislature </person_mentioned>has entailed on <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Mr. Thos. F. McKinny</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Quintana Mouth of Brazos Texas</location_mentioned></p>
