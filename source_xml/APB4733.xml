<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="03-04-1835">March 4 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I expected to have been on my way <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>before this, but my affairs
are not yet concluded so that I can leave I hope however that I shall not
be detained longer than all this month.</p>

<p>The affairs of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are in a much better train for that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>to become
a <location_mentioned>state</location_mentioned>, than they ever have been. The subject was before the <person_mentioned>House of
Representatives</person_mentioned> last week, and information was called for by the <person_mentioned>house</person_mentioned>
from the <person_mentioned>executive </person_mentioned>which will be given in a few days, and is very favourable
for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. The <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>there must not expect a <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>immediately, but the
matter will be put in a train to make it a state within a reasonable and
even short time— There will be an exemption of duties on cotton bagging
iron steel and some other articles I have also recommended that a <hi rend="italic">premium</hi>
be given on <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>cotton shipped to <location_mentioned>Tampico </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> also that 2
<person_mentioned>companies </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>mounted riflemen</person_mentioned> be raised in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to be stationed <location_mentioned>high up
on the Colorado and Brazos</location_mentioned>, for the purpose of defense and of opening
the <location_mentioned>road to Chihuahua</location_mentioned>—also <location_mentioned>new mail routes</location_mentioned>—one from <location_mentioned>Goliad </location_mentioned>by <location_mentioned>LaBaca</location_mentioned>,
<location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Brazoria</location_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>, and thence to <location_mentioned>Harrisburg </location_mentioned><location_mentioned>Liberty </location_mentioned>and
<location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, and several other things of interest to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, all of which
are now under consideration by the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col Almonte</person_mentioned> is the true and active <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in all these matters—
The <person_mentioned>present minister of relations, Gutierrez Estrada</person_mentioned>, is a very enlightened
and good man— As to myself, I have more <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>here than I ever had
before, and so has <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Almonte </person_mentioned>has in the press a statistical notice of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, it will be out
in a few days. I have not seen it or any part of it, but he says it gives
a favourable view of that <person_mentioned>country </person_mentioned>and its <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I hope that my friend <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>will be with you by the time you get
this— I can never sufficiently express my thankfulness to him and <person_mentioned>Jack</person_mentioned>—
They are truly sterling men Tell <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Butler </person_mentioned>told a man the other
day, that the letters which he, <person_mentioned>Butler</person_mentioned>, wrote to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in my favor was what
induced the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>there to interest themselves for me so far as to send
on <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Jack</person_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Butler</person_mentioned>, I suppose made this statement to try and
injure me with the person he was talking to, for I do not visit nor even
speak to him, and he wishes no doubt to make it appear that he tryed to
serve me, so as to induce others to believe that I am ungratefull—so far
from trying to serve me, I have reason to believe that he and <person_mentioned>Mason</person_mentioned><barker_pb n="46"/>
and <person_mentioned>Mexia</person_mentioned>, would have kept me in a <location_mentioned>dungeon </location_mentioned>for years if they could and
all because I obeyed the instructions of my <person_mentioned>constituents </person_mentioned>in opposing a
<location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned>for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>There has been a "<hi rend="italic">fuss</hi>" at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>—the <person_mentioned>soldiers in the <location_mentioned>castle </location_mentioned></person_mentioned> mutinied
and tied their <person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>etc. etc. have still possession of the <location_mentioned>castle</location_mentioned>— some
think it is the beginning of another revolution, but I do not believe it is
anything more than a mutiny of the <person_mentioned>Garrison</person_mentioned>, and that it will have no
political result whatever— The <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is perfectly tranquil in all parts,
and things are going on well</p>

<p>I think the <location_mentioned>Chihuahua road</location_mentioned> very important and have no doubt the
<person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will all unite to open it— I think the <person_mentioned>Genl </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>state
Govts</person_mentioned>- will aid and so will the <location_mentioned>state of Chihuahua</location_mentioned>, I have spoken to all
the <person_mentioned>influential men</person_mentioned> here from that state about it, and they have written
home in favor of the project— If the <person_mentioned>rifle companies</person_mentioned> are raised they will
open the way in a few months and the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>at present are in favor of
recommending to <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>that they should be raised— Calm, a dead calm,
and close attention to farming, and no excitements nor party divisions,
are all that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>needs at present—</p>

<p>Love to <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>and all the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>— I hope to see you all some time,
but really I have ceased making calculations when it will be
We have had some extra amusements here lately—the ascension of 
<person_mentioned>Robertson </person_mentioned>in a <location_mentioned>balloon </location_mentioned>a Grand Ball given by a select party of <person_mentioned>gentlemen </person_mentioned>with
the <person_mentioned>British minister</person_mentioned> at their head. I was at it—there was quite a display—
also some masquerades new operas etc.— But these things cannot divert
my thoughts from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, and I will try before I leave to have
things put in a favourable train for that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>to be a <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>before long—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. [F. Austin]</person_mentioned></p>
