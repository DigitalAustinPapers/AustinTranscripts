<p>Gentlemen</p>

<p>I inclose to you a letter to <person_mentioned>Messrs Parish Gasquet and Co.</person_mentioned> of your City,
also an unsigned draft from <person_mentioned>Col Barnard E. Bee</person_mentioned> on said house for $1800)
one thousand eight hundred dollars— This matter appears to be in rather
an awkward situation owing to the want of the signature of <person_mentioned>Col Bee</person_mentioned>—
This is explained in my letter to <person_mentioned>P. G. and Co.</person_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Col Bee</person_mentioned>'s instructions
to them which he asured me should be given on his arrival will however
be sufficient I presume and I hope there will be no delay in paying the
money over to you— I am responsible for the statement I have made and
for the money should <person_mentioned>Col Bee</person_mentioned> refuse to recognise the transaction, which I
know he will not—</p>

<p>I have drawn on you for five hundred dollars favor of <person_mentioned>G. Borden</person_mentioned> to be
paid out of said draft on <person_mentioned>P. G. and Co</person_mentioned> The balance say $1300) one 
thousand three hundred dollars you will please retain subject to my order</p>

<p>I shall probably commence improving a <location_mentioned>Cotton plantation</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1837">next year</date_mentioned>
and shall necessarily need the services of a <person_mentioned>Merchant in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and
I wish to do all my business through your <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>. My brother in law
<person_mentioned>James F. Perry</person_mentioned> will send on his crop to you shortly</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
