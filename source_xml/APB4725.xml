<p>Austin to James F. Perry, Mexico, February 6, 1835. Publication of his pamphlet has created good feeling. Trouble with Anthony Butler. Plans for the future</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="02-06-1835">Feb. 6, 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr. <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I send you by <person_mentioned>Mr. [Peter W.] Grayson</person_mentioned> a copy of the exposition I have
published, defending the<person_mentioned> people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and myself. I wish you to
preserve it, as I find I shall have no copies left. I think I shall leave in
ten or fifteen days for <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>. I am waiting for the publication of the
general amnesty law, which it is said will be done <date_mentioned n="02-07-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="02-08-1835">next day</date_mentioned>,
when I shall be free once more for I am still on bail.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col Butler</person_mentioned> has refused to give me up my last note of 1900 and odd
dollars which I paid to <person_mentioned>Whitesides </person_mentioned>alleging that <person_mentioned>Whitesides </person_mentioned>had drawn on
me for more than he was authorised to do. <person_mentioned>Whitesides </person_mentioned>receipt as <person_mentioned>Butlers agent</person_mentioned>is in my desk and I wish you to see him, and let him know that if
<person_mentioned>Butler </person_mentioned>refuses to give up my note I shall hold <person_mentioned>Whitesides </person_mentioned>responsible.
He must show his authority from <person_mentioned>Butler </person_mentioned>to draw.</p>

<p>If you can get along without selling land I wish you to do so, as it
will be a sacrifice to sell now. The <location_mentioned>league adjoining and below St. Felipe</location_mentioned>.,
and the one <location_mentioned>on the West Bernard (a prairie league)</location_mentioned> must not be sold for
any price as I may dispose of it otherwise. I send you some seeds. I refer
you to <person_mentioned>Mr Grayson</person_mentioned> for all the news. I hope that a dead calm will reign
all over <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>for many years to come—and that there will be no more
excitements of any kind whatever.</p>

<p>Cotton will be high here <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1836">next year</date_mentioned>. There are a great many <location_mentioned>large factories</location_mentioned>
building in various places by <person_mentioned>foreigners</person_mentioned>—the demand for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>cotton
will be very great, deliverd at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I do not write to my <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, because I cannot write to all, and <person_mentioned>Grayson</person_mentioned>
can tell them all the news.</p><barker_pb n="42"/>

<p>I look forward with the most heartfelt anxiety to the period when I
shall be restored to you all once more, so that I can enjoy your society
and that of my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in a <location_mentioned>log cabbin</location_mentioned>, or a <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned>—far very far from
the intrigues and vilinous intanglements of <location_mentioned>palaces </location_mentioned>and politics.</p>

<p>My opposition to a <location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="xx-xxx1834">last year</date_mentioned> has been the main cause of all my
entanglements—but I did my duty and under the same circumstances I
would do again just as I did in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">1833</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have more <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>here now than I ever had, and so has <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—my
exposition has had a good effect—tho I am told that I shall be attacked in
the <location_mentioned>newspapers</location_mentioned>, or that a reply will be given to it etc. I fear nothing
from such an attack.</p>

<p>Remember me to all your <person_mentioned>neighbors </person_mentioned>and my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in general when
you see them and to <person_mentioned>J. H Bell</person_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>Jacks</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>McKinny</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Miller</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Martin</person_mentioned>,
<person_mentioned>Burnett </person_mentioned>etc in particular</p>

<p>Love to all the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>. I hope they are learning fast. Love to <person_mentioned>Eliza</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Phillips</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Grayson</person_mentioned> has a project to establish a <location_mentioned>cotton factory</location_mentioned> by a <person_mentioned>company</person_mentioned>
which I am much in favor of and have authorised him to take stock for me.
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has cost me trouble and labor enough, and I hope yet to see some
happy days there. I have seen but few as yet. I presume my friend <person_mentioned>S. M.
Williams</person_mentioned> is at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>, for which reason I do not write to him. I 
requested you and him to distroy the letters I sent by <location_mentioned>Offutt </location_mentioned>without showing
them to any one, which I hope was done. Calm, a <hi rend="italic">dead calm</hi>, is all that
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>needs—make good crops, and send them to <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Tampico </location_mentioned>etc.
Remember me to <person_mentioned>H. Austin</person_mentioned> and his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>. Tell them to keep up good
spirits—the dark days have passed, if you can only keep good health.
your affectionate <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. James F. Perry</person_mentioned> near <location_mentioned>Brazoria Texas</location_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Mr Grayson</person_mentioned></p>
