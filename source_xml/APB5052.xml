<p><location_mentioned>Camp Near the Mill (600 yds. from Bexar)</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-18-1835">November 18th 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>I this moment recd. yours of the <date_mentioned n="10-08-1835">8 Ult.</date_mentioned> and am rejoiced to hear that you
are all in good health and getting along so well in the way of picking out
Cotton etc.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Joel [Bryan]</person_mentioned> has gone out in pursuit of <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>who left the <location_mentioned>fort</location_mentioned>
<date_mentioned n="11-12-1835">5 or 6 days ago</date_mentioned> to meet a <person_mentioned>reinforcement </person_mentioned>which are coming on from <location_mentioned>Laredo</location_mentioned>.
The <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>under <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>is stated to amount to between <person_mentioned>1 and 2 
hundred men</person_mentioned>. the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>in persuit of him under the command of <person_mentioned>Col Burleson</person_mentioned> consists of <person_mentioned>180 men</person_mentioned>: they will be back <date_mentioned n="11-18-1835">to day</date_mentioned> or <date_mentioned n="11-19-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>If they
come a cross him they will be apt to take him if they doe, I think it will
end the campaign</p>

<p>There are about <person_mentioned>6 hundred men</person_mentioned> in camp, a sufficient force to take <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>
if we had the necessary tools. It will be attacked in a day or two at all
hazards as the corn is getting scarse and it seams that there is no hopes of
the cannon coming soon. <person_mentioned>Grant </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Viesca </person_mentioned>were on their way to <location_mentioned>Vera
Cruz</location_mentioned> under an <person_mentioned>escort of 20 soldiers</person_mentioned> and instead of the <person_mentioned>Soldiers </person_mentioned>taking them
to the place they were ordered they brought them to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Grant </person_mentioned>is now
here and <person_mentioned>Viesca </person_mentioned>has gone to <location_mentioned>San felipe</location_mentioned></p><barker_pb n="261"/>

<p>We will have <person_mentioned>100 men</person_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>La Bahia</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Goliad </location_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="11-20-1835">a day or two</date_mentioned>, The
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>are all driven away from the <location_mentioned>Irish town on the Nueces</location_mentioned> a 
considerable battle took place in which 6 or 8 <person_mentioned>mexicans </person_mentioned>were killed and several
wounded and the balance dispersed—</p>

<p>N. B. The <person_mentioned>reinforcement </person_mentioned>that is coming on consists of <person_mentioned>60 soldiers</person_mentioned> and
<person_mentioned>300 convicts</person_mentioned>. I think we will be able to take the <person_mentioned>60 soldiers</person_mentioned> and untie the
<person_mentioned>convicts </person_mentioned>Some days agoe I thought the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>would be broke up as they
were all tiard of waiting for the cannon and hearing no news from the
<location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>and desertion more or less every day: but now every body is in
good spirits and <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>expected etc <person_mentioned>Grant </person_mentioned>brings news that the
<person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> is gaining ground in the interior. <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>must fall in a few
days or it will not fall at all</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>is better and tiard enough of commanding <person_mentioned>militia</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I will write by the next chance if any thing occures,</p>

<p>We have skirmishes every day</p>
