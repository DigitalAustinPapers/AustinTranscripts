that you will have fortitude Enough to doo what you think Right,
and pay no attention to the whims of the people I doo not consider
that any man has a Right to say what quantity of Land the other
shall have or what difference shall be made in the distribution of
Lands among the different settlers but yourself and pay no 
attention to them but pursue a corse of Equity and Justice and that to
be governed by your Own Impartial feelings— as to <person_mentioned>Grroce </person_mentioned>I saw
him a few days previous to geting your letter and conversed with
him on the subject of his Land he stated to me that he did not
want <person_mentioned>Sims </person_mentioned>to Run his Lands untill he saw you was the only Reason
he had in writing to <person_mentioned>Sims </person_mentioned>however I can Explain to you 
agreeable to you Request what he wishes, he want[s] the 2 corner made
by <person_mentioned>christman </person_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>to stand and to Run out 10 Thousand
Bares or to begin at his upper corner on the Run made by 
<person_mentioned>christman </person_mentioned>and Run East. 10 Thousand Bares South 10000 Bares and so
on making Ten Thousand Bares square though you know <person_mentioned>Groce</person_mentioned>
If you were to give him Twenty Leagues he would want forty he
is Two averisious he is I know unreasonably so I presume If you
could make the alteration as he now wishes there would be no 
further Trouble with him   though I think it due to your feelings from<barker_pb n="932"/>
his conduct to inforce the Order of Survey as you have already
made the plan however in that case I would not advise but leave
