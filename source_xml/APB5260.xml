<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Your public duties will no doubt occupy nearly all your thoughts at
this critical conjunction of your public affairs yet the solicitude of one
about a <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>in the midst of danger must be my apology for asking
your attention a few moments. I wish to enquire if you know any [thing]
of <person_mentioned>Mr. James McNair</person_mentioned>? He may not have come to your notice, being a
plain unassuming man, but sterling in those qualities which make a good
citizen—industry integrity and honesty of purpose. His place is on the
<location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>, near <location_mentioned>Eagle Lake</location_mentioned>, a little <location_mentioned>below <person_mentioned>Wm. Alley</person_mentioned>'s ferry</location_mentioned> and I believe
near the place where he help'd to plant the first corn within your <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>
in the <date_mentioned n="Spring-1822">spring of 1822</date_mentioned>. But to assist you in making a little enquiry to find
out his present condition I will briefly state that he was here <date_mentioned n="Winter-1835">last winter</date_mentioned>
was a year on my invitation and return'd with Messrs. <person_mentioned>Mather </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Morris</person_mentioned>,
in the Schooner Jane Corroline (having some goods which I sent with him)
since which time I have heard from him but twice His last letter was dated
<date_mentioned n="03-03-1836">3d of March last</date_mentioned>, at <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>and stated that he was that day draughted
into the Militia, and was to join the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned><date_mentioned n="03-04-1836">next morning</date_mentioned>. Now the Battle
of <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> has been fought since that and I am left to conjecture
whether he has survived or not.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Sir, as, from what I have heard of you, there is no
person in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>who I would be more likely to interest in the cause of
humanity than yourself, I confidently trust that, the motives which dictate<barker_pb n="424"/>
this, finding a ready response in your bosom, you will take a little trouble
to find out whether my <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>be alive and well, or otherwise</p>

<p><person_mentioned>James </person_mentioned>being an <person_mentioned>old settler</person_mentioned> must be pretty well known along the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>
but it is likely he is best known amongst the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>If you would be kind
enough to reply to this I should be very much obliged to you</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm. McNair</person_mentioned>,<location_mentioned> 750 Greenwich Street</location_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>General Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
Care of <person_mentioned>Mr. James W Breedlove Collector <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>
