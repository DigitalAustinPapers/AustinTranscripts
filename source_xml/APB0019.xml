<p>It is to be observed that agreeable to the above statement a balance
is due <person_mentioned>George Lauman</person_mentioned> which balance he supposes he has a claim on
us as taken up by our <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>which I admit. But if a Six Months
Credit is allowed on this balance it will be found not to be due untill
the <date_mentioned n="05-28-1796">28 May</date_mentioned> so that it cannot operate against any demand I have
on the Land business. It ought also to be remember'd that my
Drafts was protested in <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1975">October </date_mentioned>and that at that time <person_mentioned>George 
Lauman</person_mentioned> was in my Debt £481 „ 11 as the last of the above goods say
£652.12.6 1/2 was not deliver'd untill <date_mentioned n="11-28-1795">November the 28th</date_mentioned> Nor was <person_mentioned>Mr
Lauman</person_mentioned> under any obligation to deliver any More goods than the
Sum due me nor did I wish him to do so. I cannot see why <person_mentioned>Mr 
Lauman</person_mentioned> may not as well demand a Credit for the £453.19.4 as for
£171.10.3 as that amount of goods was taken up by myself four days
after the £171.10.3 neither of which I conceive have any thing to
do with the land contract, Nor can my being in debt to <person_mentioned>George
Lauman</person_mentioned> or <person_mentioned>Lauman and West</person_mentioned> be consider'd as a violation of my
Contract with <person_mentioned>Blanchard and Lauman</person_mentioned> for Lands. I also wish to
remind the Gentlemen who are to give an opinion on this business
that<person_mentioned> Mr Lauman</person_mentioned> has agreed to make a discount on the above goods<barker_pb n="27"/>
of One Hundred Pounds on account of their being overcharge.
Which discount I agreed should be settle'd with <person_mentioned>Mr Blanchard</person_mentioned> before
I understood how the balance of this account was to be applied, but
when it is considered that the Hundred pound ought to be taken off
from the amount Charged me a small balance will be found due
<person_mentioned>G Lauman</person_mentioned> so that justice cannot demand that <person_mentioned>Mr Lauman</person_mentioned> should
claim a Credit on account of the Land business nor do I think in
Justice I am bound to settle with <person_mentioned>Mr Lauman</person_mentioned> for any balance that
may be found due on this Exchange of property it not being 
agreeable to my Orders, Bequest or intention that <person_mentioned>Mr Blanchard</person_mentioned> should
receive any more than the balance due me from <person_mentioned>Mr Lauman</person_mentioned>.</p>
