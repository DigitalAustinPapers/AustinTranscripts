<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>It affords me much pleasure to have it in my power to 
introduce to your acquaintance the bearer My worthy and warm friend
<person_mentioned>Mr Thomas Hooper</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mr Hooper</person_mentioned> will not only be a valuable 
addition to your society from his personal merits—But from that enter-<barker_pb n="987"/>
prize which in a new and growing community like yours is so
inestimable. He carries with him an industrious and respectable
<person_mentioned>mechanic</person_mentioned>—in conjunction with whom should the prospects justify
the attempt—he intends to erect a <location_mentioned>saw and grist mill</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>cotton
gin</location_mentioned>. Undertaking like this cant fail to be of public benefit, whilst
I cannot but wish that <person_mentioned>Mr H</person_mentioned> will be pleased with your <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>—I regret that any circumstance which would not be to him and
his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>a positive benefit—should deprive his friends of his 
society, hospitality and unlimited friendship.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J° Thomas</person_mentioned></p>
<p>PS.</p>

<p>I have strong hopes that one of my <person_mentioned>Junior Brother</person_mentioned>s, will locate
himself in your <location_mentioned>neighborhood</location_mentioned>—and I think it is not very 
improbable that I may visit you in the course of the <date_mentioned n="Summer-1825">next Summer</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J°T</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
