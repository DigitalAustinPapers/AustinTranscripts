<p>I wrote you that I did not wish you to risk anything in this 
enterprise, if you can conveniently Ship Some Corn, or Shorts, or Flour
to <person_mentioned>Joseph H. Hawkins</person_mentioned> it will help, also if the <person_mentioned>Blacksmith </person_mentioned>or any
other kind of tools were saved at the <location_mentioned>mines </location_mentioned>send them, also 
everything belonging to the <location_mentioned>estate at Little Rock</location_mentioned> with my books etc.—</p>

<p>If <person_mentioned>H Elliott</person_mentioned> will come on I think I can benefit him, but I shall not
wate for him or any other of my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in your country, neither
shall I advise them to come—they must take their own course—if they
come to me, I will do for them all I can, but if others who are on
the ground apply for any appointment in my power to procure I
shall get it for them if I can without delay—I sent <person_mentioned>Brother Brown</person_mentioned> a
Spanish Grammar he must borrow a Dictionary at <location_mentioned>St. Louis</location_mentioned> and
apply himself to study—he ought to go out with some good <person_mentioned>surveyor</person_mentioned>
as <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>chain carrier</person_mentioned></hi> if no better can be done, so as to learn the art of
surveying, he will find it of use in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and he must now learn to
<hi rend="italic">work</hi>,—he had better employ himself in this manner untill I get
things under way—</p>

<p>If any of you write to me direct to the care of <person_mentioned>Ambroise Sampyrac</person_mentioned>
<location_mentioned>Nachitoches </location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">and pay the postage</hi>, or I shall not get the letters.</p>

<p>I leave here the <date_mentioned n="11-25-1821">day after tomorrow</date_mentioned>, and the vessel sails the same
clay—it will probably be one year before I return to the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned>,
in the mean time take care of our Dear <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>, and make no 
calculations on me, or <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>until I get better under way in that country—
Send on as many <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>of good character as you can—I have no
doubt of success and think that all who join me will do well, but I
advice no one to come, no man shall reproach me for leading him
into difficulty should things result badly—</p>

<p>Give my love to <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>- I wrote them a
