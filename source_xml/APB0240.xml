<p>Petition for Enlargement of<location_mentioned> Washington County</location_mentioned></p>

<p>[December, 1813 ?]</p>

<p>To the Honorable the <person_mentioned>Legislature of the <location_mentioned>Territory of Missouri</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> the
Memorial of the <person_mentioned>Inhabitants </person_mentioned>of that part of the late Township of
<location_mentioned>Grand River</location_mentioned> situated East of said River Humbly sheweth
that where as by the late Law establishing the <location_mentioned>County of 
Washington</location_mentioned> the said <person_mentioned>Inhabitants east of <location_mentioned>Grand River</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are placed in a
situation truly disagreeable and distressing in many points of View
by beeing divided from the <location_mentioned>settlement West of the said Grand River
</location_mentioned>and left attached to the <location_mentioned>County of Saint Geneveive</location_mentioned>, they therefore
most humbly pray your Honorable body will cause the line of the
said <location_mentioned>County of Washington</location_mentioned> to be so altered as to include with in
said <location_mentioned>County </location_mentioned>all the <person_mentioned>Inhabitants </person_mentioned>settled on the <location_mentioned>Waters of the said
Grand River</location_mentioned> and on the <location_mentioned>Waters of the tarre blue</location_mentioned> Causing the line
of said <location_mentioned>Washington County</location_mentioned> to run on the dividing ridge between
the <location_mentioned>Waters of the Plattin</location_mentioned> and the said <location_mentioned>Grand River </location_mentioned>and also on the
dividing ridge between the Waters of the establishment <location_mentioned>Creek </location_mentioned>and
the said <location_mentioned>tarre blue</location_mentioned> and up said <location_mentioned>ridge</location_mentioned>, to, <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>James Bryan</person_mentioned>s Saw mill</location_mentioned> on
the said <location_mentioned>tarre blue</location_mentioned> from thence to the<location_mentioned> headwaters of flatt Creek</location_mentioned> to
unite with the line of <location_mentioned>Washington County</location_mentioned> as It now runs</p>

<p>In Justification of the alteration of said line of <location_mentioned>Washington
County</location_mentioned> as above designated, your <person_mentioned>petitioners </person_mentioned>state first that the 
<location_mentioned>settlements east of said Grand River</location_mentioned> do not amount to a sufficient 
Number to form a <location_mentioned>Township </location_mentioned>by which means many inconveniences will
Result in as much as Most of the transactions either directly or 
indirectly are connectly [connected] with the <person_mentioned>settlers on the <location_mentioned>West bank
of the said Grand River</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Second they do not furnish Numbers sufficient to forme a 
<person_mentioned>Company of Militia</person_mentioned> and by beeing attach'd to the <location_mentioned>County of Saint
Geneveive</location_mentioned> must be drawn manv miles to do militia Duty.</p>

<p>Third because a division of a <location_mentioned>Settlement </location_mentioned>so immediately Connected
by <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and Interests is productive of real disadvantages to the
<person_mentioned>Inhabitants</person_mentioned>, that many Other disadvantages will result to said 
<person_mentioned>Inhabitants </person_mentioned>from a Continuation of said <location_mentioned>County line</location_mentioned> Wherefore your
<person_mentioned>Petitioners </person_mentioned>pray that your Honorable body will take into 
Consideration this memorial of the <person_mentioned>Inhabitants living on the <location_mentioned>East bank
of Grand River</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and grant the prayer thereof and your petitioner
as in Duty will Ever pray.</p>
