<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>With this I send you a letter from the <person_mentioned>Col [Austin]</person_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="12-02-1834">2d Decemr</date_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>:
which will inform you of his health etc, and further that the <person_mentioned>president of
the <location_mentioned>Republic</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, to whom was referred the difficulties between <person_mentioned>Monclova </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>Saltillo </person_mentioned>has recommended new elections througout the <location_mentioned>State </location_mentioned>for <person_mentioned>Govr </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Vice
Govr </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>members of Legislature</person_mentioned> etc.</p>

<p>This will retard the meeting of <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>or more properly the 
<person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>until <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1835">March</date_mentioned>— The <person_mentioned>friends of the Col</person_mentioned> at this place are determined
in following up the old ticket and elect him and <person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>again.</p><barker_pb n="38"/>

<p>I have got the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamto </person_mentioned>of this place to report favourably to the <person_mentioned>govt</person_mentioned>
respecting our <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>and I shall leave this place about the <date_mentioned n="01-20-1835">20th </date_mentioned>for 
<location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned></p>

<p>It is truly said that it is an "ill wind that blows no body any good" now
I think that this head flaw on the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>will enable me to stop the
head way of my <person_mentioned>big JEFF</person_mentioned> "who would be taller than any of his <person_mentioned>tribe </person_mentioned>from
the shoulders and upwards" At any rate it gives me much hope and
good spirits. Present me kindly to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Perry</person_mentioned> and also the kind 
remembrances of my <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>and believe me truly yours</p>
