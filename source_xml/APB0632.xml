<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I wrote you by last mail but as you are in the <location_mentioned>settlements </location_mentioned>on 
business of such a nature it is uncertain if you will receive my letter,
for which reason I write you again in order to be more sure of
the receipt.</p><barker_pb n="697"/>

<p>I thot to have been on my way before now for <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, but am
detained by a <person_mentioned>Mr. Leporte</person_mentioned> who I expect to accompany me, I think
however I shall set out in less than a week from this place, by the
way of <location_mentioned>altamira</location_mentioned>, and as I do not take with me money enough to
purchase medicines and may not fall in with accquaintances from
<location_mentioned>St. Louis</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned>, I wish you to do me the favor to inform
<location_mentioned>Mr J. H. Hawkins</location_mentioned> of my character to whom I may recur if 
necessary in my dealings-—I will here communicate you a design as I
always have communicated to you as my most faithful friend in
whose opinion I have the utmost confidence, I am about to make a
formal representation or application to the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. thro the medium
and friendship of <person_mentioned>Doctr. Ramos</person_mentioned> who is now a <person_mentioned>member of Congress</person_mentioned>,
for all the <location_mentioned>Red River country</location_mentioned> including <location_mentioned>Pecon point</location_mentioned> as I presume
it is not yet occupied, also a letter of the right of citizenship and
the appointment of <person_mentioned>Surver [Surveyor]</person_mentioned> for all <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>or the 4
<location_mentioned>provinces</location_mentioned> if you please, this however, will never interfere with
your right to survey all your tract, but rather stimulate me to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
sooner when I will take a pleasure in being serviceable to you in
this business—consulting with a <person_mentioned>lawyer</person_mentioned>, he tells me it cannot be
convenient to obtain the imploy without a certain document or 
cirtificate of my abilities from a person who may know me to be presented
in the <person_mentioned>congress</person_mentioned>, which I can alone ask of you as the only one known
in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>who knows my qualifications this I wish you to have the
goodness to remit by the first opportunity to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Doctr. Ramos</person_mentioned>
who will have the care of my business, perhaps it ought to be in
sealed paper, but notwithstanding send it on any. The post is
seting out I cannot say more I live in great hope to see you before
another years Rolls round.</p>

<p>I wish you all success in the world and remain your ever sincire
friend</p>
