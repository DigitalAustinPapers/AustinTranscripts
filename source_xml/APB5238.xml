<p><location_mentioned>Peach Point</location_mentioned>, near <location_mentioned>Brazoria Texas</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="07-27-1836">July 27 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Maj. Gen. E. P. Gain[e]s</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honor to write you on the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th instant</date_mentioned> on the subject of the 
<person_mentioned>indians</person_mentioned>, and also in relation to the termination of the war between <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, through the mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> on the basis of the full 
recognition of the independence of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have just been informed that <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> has written to you on
this subject— I have not seen his letter, nor have I seen or had any 
intercourse with him since I wrote you last, and can therefore say nothing as
to his present views or ideas.</p>

<p>When I saw him last, on the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th July</date_mentioned>, he stated to me that he wished to
terminate the war on the basis of a full and immediate acknowledgement
of the independence of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and that he wished to effect this
object through the mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> I observed that the proper mode
of obtaining such mediation was by an application from the <person_mentioned>Govt. of
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to that of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>— He replyed that such an application would be
made by him the moment he was at liberty and could return to <location_mentioned>mexico </location_mentioned>and
resume the <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>. I answered that his release was impossible 
without such previous guarantees as would fully satisfy the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Army
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and even put it out of his power, or the power of the <person_mentioned>Govt. of
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to deviate, were they disposed to do so, and that I could see but
one guarantee that would effectually do this, which was that of the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>
Govt.</person_mentioned> He said he would write to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned>, I advised him to do so,
believing that it would, at least, be a kind of opening of the Subject, which
would lead to a corespondence of some character between the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, that might result favourably for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. In any event I could not
see that any harm could by any possibility grow out of it—</p>

<p>Under this view of the matter I wrote to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> At the same time,
and gave him all the information I could on the subject—</p>

<p>I have no concealments or Mistery in any matter connected with this, or
any other subject of public interest to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— I am nothing more than
an individual <person_mentioned>citizen of this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, but I feel a more lively interest for
its welfare than can be expressed—one that is greatly superior to all
pecuniary or personal views of any kind— The prosperity of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has
been the object of my labors, the idol of my existence—it has assumed the
character of a <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, for the guidance of my thoughts and actions, for
fifteen years— Influenced by this controuling principle, I wish to see the<barker_pb n="404"/>
war ended as speedily as possible, to avert farther evils from this people,
and I also wish to see <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>annexed to the <location_mentioned>U. S</location_mentioned>. as I believe that to be
the most effectual and speedy mode of procuring for its <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>that
security and stability in civil <person_mentioned>Gov</person_mentioned>. which alone can compensate them for
their past sufferings therefore have no hesitation in saying to you and to
every one else, that I wish for the intervention of the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>U. S</location_mentioned>. Govt</person_mentioned>, in the
affairs of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—that I have endeavor'd to procure its intervention, and
that this was my only object in advising <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> to apply to <person_mentioned>Gen.
Jackson</person_mentioned>, and my only object in writing to him and to You on the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th
instant</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Rumor and excited passions or political Slander have accused me of a
desire to save the life of <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> in violation of justice which
demands his execution as a <person_mentioned>murderer</person_mentioned>— I have had no hand in saving him
and he was saved by the armistice entered into by <person_mentioned>Gen. Sam Houston</person_mentioned> on
the <date_mentioned n="04-22-1836">22d April</date_mentioned>, and by the <person_mentioned>Cabinet of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> afterwards— I have no undue
sympathy for <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>— My sympathies are all for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and her
<person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>, and if <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> can be used to end the war, I am willing to
use him on the principle of public good, and more especially after he was
saved and treated with on the <location_mentioned>field of battle</location_mentioned> and received as a <person_mentioned>prisoner </person_mentioned>of
war and treated as such by the <person_mentioned>Civil and military authorities of the 
country</person_mentioned>. But I am not willing to turn him loose without previous, and ample,
and sufficient, and unquestionable guarantees— The only one of this
character that I can see, is the guarantee of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and I have endeavored
(so far as I have had anything to do with this matter) to use <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa
</person_mentioned>for the purpose of obtaining it</p>

<p>Many here have objected that in my letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> and to you of
<date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4 instant</date_mentioned>, I stated that I believed <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> was sincere in his promises
to end the war and acknowledge our independence— The object of those
letters was to procure the guarantee of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and it would have been a
St[r]ange thing in me, to have said to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned>, and, to you, that I
did not believe in <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s promises, and at the same time Asked you
to Guarantee them— I consider it quite immaterial whether he is sincere
or not, if through his promises the guarantee of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> can be obtained,
for that very guarantee would <hi rend="italic">make </hi>him secure by compelling him, to
comply, as he well knows—</p>

<p>I consider that there is but one doubt or difficulty about this matter,
which is whether <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s power and influence in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>would be
sufficient to enable him to procure an acknowledgment of the independence
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— This doubt I think is well founded, and that it can only be
removed by some <hi rend="italic">official act</hi> of the <person_mentioned>Govt. of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> that would be binding
on the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>, such an <hi rend="italic">official act</hi> I thought might be procured through the
mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> while <person_mentioned>Santa Anna's friends</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>were still in<barker_pb n="405"/>
power, and his letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> I thought might open a door to
obtain it—</p>

<p>Such have been and are the motives which influence me</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
