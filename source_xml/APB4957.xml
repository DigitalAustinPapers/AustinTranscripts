<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-16-1835">16th October 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Genl Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Prisioners </person_mentioned>arrived <date_mentioned n="10-16-1835">This evening</date_mentioned><person_mentioned> Mr Jack </person_mentioned>says he cannot take them
he thinks you didnot reflect on his unprepared situation to accommodate
them and his time being entirely taken up with the Buisiness of the <location_mentioned>Land
office</location_mentioned>, as such I must prepare them a Room, one being Liberated to go
<location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>on Parole as you request. <person_mentioned>Governor Zavala</person_mentioned> will direct the 
Treatment of the others I am told that this Very <person_mentioned>colonel </person_mentioned>had <person_mentioned>Zavala </person_mentioned>a <person_mentioned>prisioner</person_mentioned>
once and Tantalized him how far this may Influence his feelings towards
them I dont know but he will no doubt be willing to make them 
comfortable—The <person_mentioned>troops from <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> etc are expected to pass <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>
soon you can have it as I have it from the representations given by <person_mentioned>Genl.
Houston</person_mentioned> and others so far as they know I hope the force will be
respectable</p>

<p>I must say something to you and to <person_mentioned>absent members of the Convention
</person_mentioned>of Vital Importance to Texas—The <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>here are like <person_mentioned>Volunteers in
<location_mentioned>Camp</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> (Very Restless) and much is said about going <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>one by one
each Plead their necesities some from the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>are afraid of <person_mentioned>Indians on
the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> others to the <location_mentioned>Eastward </location_mentioned>are not fully into the spirit of our times
and are yet wanting some explanition I am proud to find only a few think
that way but from what I learn their <person_mentioned>constituents </person_mentioned>are far behind in correct<barker_pb n="188"/>
Information as to every thing, as for Instance to relative strength the Cause
etc etc. the Land speculation subject is not yet satisfactory settled <location_mentioned>abroad</location_mentioned>
as the <person_mentioned>Delegates </person_mentioned>say also that our Proceedings have not had general 
Circulation all these circumstances render it necessary If not Indispensable to
so arrange that the <person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>Return to Hold the Convention as Speedily as
possible I think we can detain all but a few till about the <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">1st. Novr.</date_mentioned>
after that it will require positive assurances of a meeting and that in a few
days to stop them Is my belief, several <person_mentioned>persons </person_mentioned>Present urge me to be more
Pressing on this subject believing that the confusion that would inevitably
follow by a failure of the <person_mentioned>Present Convention</person_mentioned> would be the distruction of
all our Hopes of Order and Certainty— Several <person_mentioned>Persons </person_mentioned>Remaining here
will urge and will do everything in our Power but be assured it is all
important to attend to it I think I would like to have you consult those
who leave here <date_mentioned n="10-17-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>and have their Ideas on this subject.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Indian Chiefs </person_mentioned>will I suppose be here soon I would like you to
converse with <person_mentioned>Genl Houston</person_mentioned> on the subject and If you or you and the 
<person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>out in service can Give any assurances to them to do so, I will as far
as the <person_mentioned>Council </person_mentioned>has authority and will also Provide them comforts. <person_mentioned>Col.
Pettus</person_mentioned>, will write you and send a Bill of Articles sent by the two wagons
to leave in the <date_mentioned n="10-17-1835">morning </date_mentioned>I hope the Wagons from <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>are <location_mentioned>on the
Road</location_mentioned> before now.</p>

<p>We look for <person_mentioned>Capt Wm Hall</person_mentioned> who is authorised to contract for meal etc
what he has done I dont know but suppose he has filled the Order—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>R. R. Royal President of Council</person_mentioned></p>

<p>the Cannon from <location_mentioned>Harrisburg </location_mentioned>has been badly managed and will be about
<date_mentioned n="10-18-1835">two more days</date_mentioned> before it passes here from <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>I learn two only have
cariages—This <date_mentioned n="10-16-1835">morning </date_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>minority of the consultation</person_mentioned> met and 
adjourned till <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">1st Novr</date_mentioned>. or till a <person_mentioned>quorum </person_mentioned>to do buisiness Those who remain
