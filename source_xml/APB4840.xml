<p>My Dear Sir, I came on <date_mentioned n="08-01-1835">Saturday the first inst</date_mentioned>—but did not know in what
capacity—I thought probably to a convention of all <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>or, at least
to a council of all the <person_mentioned>department of Brassos</person_mentioned>—but it turned out to be in
consequence of the order of<person_mentioned> His Honor James B. Miller</person_mentioned> etc.— <person_mentioned>4 
Municipalities</person_mentioned> was represented, and <person_mentioned>3</person_mentioned> was not—It turned out as—friend <person_mentioned>Fisher</person_mentioned>
predicted—<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>—and so much the better for us—but we felt ourselves
unauthorised to do anything <hi rend="italic">(even recommendatory)</hi> because there was not
a full representation—<person_mentioned>The Honbl Acting Chief [Wily Martin]</person_mentioned> Informed
us that <person_mentioned>Doctr Miller</person_mentioned> had not informed him of any reasons he had for 
calling the <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>etc, that <person_mentioned>Commissioners (Messrs Gritton and Barrett)</person_mentioned>
had been sent to see <person_mentioned>Genl Cos</person_mentioned>—In order to explain through him<barker_pb n="97"/>
to the <person_mentioned>president </person_mentioned>the whole affairs of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—The <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>dissolved the counsil,
without a day—but it is understood that he will recommend to those 
<location_mentioned>municipalities </location_mentioned>not represented in this <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>to hold elections for <person_mentioned>delegates</person_mentioned>, and
that in case of Immergencies, after hearing from our <person_mentioned>commissioners</person_mentioned>, he
will call them together again. A question is pending in <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>on the
subject of <hi rend="italic">Convention </hi>or no <hi rend="italic">Convention</hi>, and to be tried on <date_mentioned n="08-13-1835">Saturday week</date_mentioned>—
I believe it is the <hi rend="italic">Desire </hi>of a Majority of all to keep pease as long as
<hi rend="italic">(hands off)</hi> and when our rights and priveleges are invaded to kick like
mules all feet at once— <person_mentioned>Chambers </person_mentioned>will wright you—and I must refer
you to <person_mentioned>Mr. Robbinson</person_mentioned> etc—for the ballance of the news— My Respects
to <person_mentioned>Mrs-L.</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>little ones</person_mentioned> and believe me Dear Cir Yours truly—</p>
