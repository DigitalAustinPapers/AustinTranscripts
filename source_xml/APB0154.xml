<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Your favor of <date_mentioned n="07-20-1809">20th ultimo</date_mentioned> was received by your <person_mentioned>son</person_mentioned>, on the <date_mentioned n="07-15-1809">15th
instant</date_mentioned>. On the same day, we received from our <person_mentioned>friends in <location_mentioned>New
York</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, your d'fts on <person_mentioned>Messrs. Bellows and Cochran of <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, under
acceptance.</p>

<p>Conformably to your instructions, we endeavoured to exchange
them with our <person_mentioned>Banks</person_mentioned>, for post notes; but failed. Their principal
objection appears to be, to the long sight at which they are drawn.
We shall hold them untill this objection is removed, and (unless in
the interim, otherwise instructed,) then make another attempt, in
which we are not without hopes of success. The result, whether
propitious, or the contrary, shall be forthwith communicated to you.
We are not informed what part of your lead [undecipherable
abbreviation] has been sold in <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>. So soon as we receive
<person_mentioned>Mesrs. Hart Bartlet and Cox</person_mentioned>'s assales [sic], we shall be enabled to
ascertain whether there will be any balance in your favor, or not.
Should there be any thing due you, it shall be paid over to your <person_mentioned>son</person_mentioned>,
as your request, and we will cheerfully afford him any aid in our
power, in the settlement [of] your business here, we will also with
pleasure furnish what supplies he may need, during his stay in
<location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned>,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Hart, Barton and Hart</person_mentioned></p>
