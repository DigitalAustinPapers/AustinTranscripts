<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="08-06-1824">6, August 1824</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I see by your note dated the <date_mentioned n="07-12-1824">12th of last month </date_mentioned>and post: marked
<location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-27-1824">27th</date_mentioned> that several of my communications since the death
of our friend <person_mentioned>H </person_mentioned>have miscaried—Also that you had not received
the paper and quills sent by a Mr---------Some time in <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1824">February </date_mentioned>or
<date_mentioned n="03-xx-1824">March last</date_mentioned>—Infact the intercourse is so very uncertain that it 
appears almost useless to attempt keeping a correspondence—</p>

<p>I received some time ago a packett from you with a letter for <person_mentioned>Mrs
Hawkins</person_mentioned> which was sent to her by a <person_mentioned>neibour </person_mentioned>that was here at the
time—and wrote to her stating your wish with regard to making a
division of the property in the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, the Ensuing
<date_mentioned n="Winter-1824">Winter </date_mentioned>requesting her to name some person to whom she would give
authority for that purpose I also wrote fully to <person_mentioned>Mr Sanders</person_mentioned> in
whom she has the most implicit confidence—and shall Expect to
hear from them early in the fall by an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>who will proceed to
the grant—</p>

<p>My former letters were mostly on the subject of the state of <person_mentioned>Mr
Hawkins</person_mentioned> affairs with a statement of the claims he appears to have
advanced in securing the grant, and for the support of <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>also
small loans to <person_mentioned>Emigrants</person_mentioned>—amounting, <hi rend="italic">including Usurious Interest</hi><barker_pb n="872"/>
to the enormous sum of thirty thousand Dollars—which advances
completely beggared his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, for at the time of his Death, his
House and <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>were mortgaged nearly to the full value and his
furniture under Execution so that <person_mentioned>Mrs Hawkins family</person_mentioned> had to 
depend on their friends for funds to take them to <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I shall send this to <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>with several letters of different
persons in the <location_mentioned>Grant </location_mentioned>hoping they may find a conveyance to you—
I now regret that I did not keep a copy of the statement formerly
sent you so as to have it annexed, but before the <person_mentioned>Agent </person_mentioned>goes out I
will again overhall the papers and make out another for your 
Inspection—As <person_mentioned>Mr H</person_mentioned> Kept no Books such an undertaking is of serious
import yet for your satisfaction and for the benefit of the <person_mentioned>Widow</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Orphan children</person_mentioned> I feel bound to make every exertion in my
power.</p>

<p>The planting Interest of <location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>have been sorely afflicted for
two years past, by inundations storms rains and rot, so that scarcely
one third of crops have been made, and every body here are suffering
in consequence of it—The present season affords better prospects,
and I hope the ensuing winter will give life and activity to our late
and present gloomy City—</p>
