<p>The <person_mentioned>Government of this <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> under date of the <date_mentioned n="10-06-1823">6th of October
last</date_mentioned> has applied to this <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>for aid in raising funds to pay the
expenses of the Honorable Dn Erasmo Seguin the deputy in the
<person_mentioned>National Congress from this <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. Under the Present System
each Province has to support its members of Congress; this Province
sends one member and it probably never will be so important that
he should be respectably Supported as at the present <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, for
this is the one which is to form the National Constitution and fix the
future fate of the Nation as well as our own—There are many things
particularly interesting to the future prosperity of this new colony
as well as of all the other new Settlements that may be formed 
hereafter in this Province that will depend on the provisions of the New<barker_pb n="709"/>
Constitution. I will vouch for Don Erasmo Seguin our deputy that
he will use every exertion possible on his part to secure us all the
privileges and liberties practable. but to do this he must have
something to live on in Mexico while labouring for us, and I have
therefore thought proper to appeal to the well tryed patriotism of
my fellow citizens of this Colony by calling on them for a 
voluntary Subscription, not doubting that when they understand the 
object for which the Contribution is wanted, and the great interest it
is to them all individually, that they will contribute with the 
Liberality So characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">American Character</hi>.</p>

<p>Considering the absolute impossibility of raising money, and 
<person_mentioned>Commissioner of the Government</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Baron de Bastrop</person_mentioned> having 
Suggested that a contribution of corn would answer the purpose, I have
thought proper to open this Subscription for corn, those who have
no corn can subscribe money, or anything else they are able for
it is expected that every man will give something in proportion
to his means. The corn or other articles Subscribed will be 
collected by persons duly authorized to do so and forwarded to <location_mentioned>San
Antonio de Bexar</location_mentioned> as soon as arrangements can be made to transport
them and a full statement of the whole will be published for the 
information of the <person_mentioned>Settlers</person_mentioned>.</p>

ourselves to pay the quantity of corn, money or other property 
annexed to our names to the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, to be collected by Colonel
<person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin political chief and Commandant of this Colony</person_mentioned>
