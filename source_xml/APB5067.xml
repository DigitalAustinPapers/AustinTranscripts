as can possibly be sent, instantly, of the first mentioned article there is
none beyond the Cannon Catridges, already made up, I hope that good
Mules, or horses, will be provided to send on these articles, with the 
greatest possible speed, traveling night and day, for there is not a moment to be
lost, <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>of men also are perhaps indispencible to our
