<p><person_mentioned>Col. Steven Austin</person_mentioned>, Dr. sir—since my return to the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned> from
the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>—I have been kept busy in endeavoring to
counteract the unfavorable impressions made here as to the soil
and climate of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—and the character and prospects of your 
<location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>there.—Some disappointed <person_mentioned>travellers </person_mentioned>joined with the <person_mentioned>large
land holders</person_mentioned> here have used every means in their power to check
embarrass and discourage emigration—The character of the 
country—is however rising here—and the tide of emigration is taking
a favorable turn.—I am very glad to learn that you have taken a
position on the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>—at the <location_mentioned>Atascosito crossing</location_mentioned>—In a 
geographical view this is a central point—and must be the centre of 
population—It is safe from invasion by sea—It is also remote from the
range of all the large tribes of <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>—and it is the very place
where a dense <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>should be formed—to be extended above
and below within supporting distance of one another—as <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
come in—as you know it is about <location_mentioned>100 miles from La Bahia</location_mentioned>—and
moreover it is not more than <location_mentioned>sixty miles from a navigable point on
the <hi rend="italic">Santo Hacinto</hi></location_mentioned>—which emptying into the <location_mentioned>Bay of Galveston</location_mentioned>
forms the best <location_mentioned>harbor </location_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>coast</location_mentioned>—Besides the navigation—of
the <location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned>is at all times practicable—with small Boats and 
although I found 10 feet water over the Bar at the mouth—the
entrance is deemed unsafe particularly in a rough sea—Yet is but
<location_mentioned>16 miles from the mouth of the Brazos</location_mentioned>—to the <location_mentioned>west end of 
Galvezton</location_mentioned>—where vessels have a safe anchorage with 30 feet water—
since my return I have sent out two boats of 30 ton each loaded
with flour and fat meat with some whiskey sugar and coffee 
consigned to <person_mentioned>Capt. John McFarlane</person_mentioned>—by bad management of the <person_mentioned>Pilot</person_mentioned>
as I am inclined to think they were both lost—I intend however<barker_pb n="738"/>
seeing you in person this <date_mentioned n="Spring-1824">spring </date_mentioned>or next <date_mentioned n="Fall-1824">fall</date_mentioned>—I have made 
arrangements with the <person_mentioned>Coshatees </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Alabamas </person_mentioned>and all the <person_mentioned>Indians on this
side the <location_mentioned>Brassos</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for their cooperation in any expedition I choose to
undertake they are well armed—and ask nothing but to be 
furnished with powder and lead—which I can easily send to them from
<location_mentioned>Alexandria </location_mentioned>I shall not bring less than 150 <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>well armed—
with six months provisions—and if the safety and security of the
<location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>requires it—I will sweep every <person_mentioned>Tawokkowni</person_mentioned>—<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Tankowa</person_mentioned></hi>
and <person_mentioned>Karrankowa</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>from the face of the earth—There is at
present a strong prospect of a war—in which <location_mentioned>France </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>will
combine to subjugate <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—in which case <location_mentioned>Great Britain</location_mentioned> and the
<location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned> will unite in support of the independence of the <location_mentioned>Mexican
Republic</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>however cannot be involved in the struggles—or
made the scene of military operations—</p>
