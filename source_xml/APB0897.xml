<p>Dr Sir I Regret not being able to move out this <date_mentioned n="Fall-1824">fall </date_mentioned>on account
of the unsetled situation of my affairs;</p>

<p>I Beg leave to call your attention to some business of mine in your
<location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>which has transpired since I Left there the Inclosed 
Documents will show the true State of the Case (that is its origin) that
is in my absence in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1821">1821 </date_mentioned>a man that was doing business for me
Credited <person_mentioned>Andrew Roberson</person_mentioned> for Groceries Ferriages etc to the amount
of $56, which he was to discharge in a mule, when I Returnd well
knowing <person_mentioned>Roberson</person_mentioned>s way of swindling and shirking out of paying
his Debts, agreed to swap horses with him to get the Debt, and give
him the Debt to boot which is $56—agreeable to an Entry made on
the <date_mentioned n="10-10-1824">10th of October 1821</date_mentioned> which Book I send you for your information
after we had setled he Told me he was about to start to the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>
and had no amunition to kill meat for his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and had no means
of geting any Except I would Credit him I answered I waz Friendly
to that business and would spare him all I had which makes the 
account of $14-25 I se him at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Inglishe</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>Pallo Gouch [Palo
Gaucho]</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="Fall-1824">Last fall </date_mentioned>he then promised to pay me when I came to the
<location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>when I went to the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>I Could not find him at home
but met him in Company with <person_mentioned>Capt Jones</person_mentioned> and others he Told me
<person_mentioned>Jackey Hall</person_mentioned> was waiting at home to settle with me I Considered
that sufficient and I made no application to him when I went to se
<person_mentioned>Mr Hall</person_mentioned> To get through with what I thought a bad Business I bought
an old horse of <person_mentioned>Hall </person_mentioned>and presented <person_mentioned>Roberson</person_mentioned>s account of $14-25,
which he stated he Recollected, and Took it, in part pay</p>

<p>I will now give you a True Statement of <person_mentioned>Col Cole</person_mentioned>s Proceedings
with me and on that Case, as I went to <location_mentioned>St. antonio</location_mentioned> I left an 
account on <person_mentioned>John Mitchell</person_mentioned> of $12 50 for Collection he Collected a
good horse and Lent him to <person_mentioned>Mr. Whiteside</person_mentioned> when I Returned
he was missing and I Could not get him but he promised to Send
him by the first safe hand I then Left with him for Collection
a note on <person_mentioned>Joshua Parker</person_mentioned> for a mule and an account on the same
for $125    also a note on <person_mentioned>G Alsberry</person_mentioned> for $20    Sometime after that<barker_pb n="933"/>
he wrote me that <person_mentioned>Roberson </person_mentioned>had Denied the account and that Hall
Talkd of attaching But that he had not seen him I conceived
It so unfounded that it would End in Idle Talk</p>

<p>But on the <date_mentioned n="09-07-1824">7th of September</date_mentioned> he wrote me that <person_mentioned>Hall </person_mentioned>had attached
and he had given up <person_mentioned>Parker</person_mentioned>s note for a mule and his account
for $12-50 to pay the Debt of $14-25,</p>

<p>Now what apears Curious to me <person_mentioned>Col Cole</person_mentioned> had sold my horse
he Collected of <person_mentioned>Mitchell </person_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Car </person_mentioned>to pay his Own Debt of $25— If
he Considered <person_mentioned>Hall</person_mentioned>s Claim good against me for $14-50 why Did he
not pay It out of my money without a Sacrafise or why Did
he not Collect It of <person_mentioned>Parker </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>Alsberry</person_mentioned>, all of which Claims had
been put in his hands for Collection Long before <person_mentioned>Hall</person_mentioned>'s against
me, had <person_mentioned>Hall</person_mentioned>s Claim been a just one I Should Consider It a 
Daring outrage Comited on me, an attachment against an <person_mentioned>Inhabitant</person_mentioned>
of the <location_mentioned>Province </location_mentioned>and Residing in the Same Place During the Time
of all the Contracts and proceedings, and the <person_mentioned>Officer </person_mentioned>to hold my
money and supply $52-50 to be Sacrifised for $14-25, and that
apeared of the Basest nature, and may justly be Considered I
am Swindled (If I was to Let It Remain so) out of $66-75 for
Befriending a <person_mentioned>villain </person_mentioned>with Powder and Lead to Save the Lives
of his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>Brazoz</location_mentioned></p>

<p>Your Honer will please Examin the whole Documents and 
Inform me If any Redress may be Expected   I am sir</p>
