<p><location_mentioned>Before Bexar</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-22-1835">Novr. 22 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>,

<p><hi rend="italic">My health has been very bad since I left the <location_mentioned>Cibolo</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1835">more than a month
ago</date_mentioned>, and I have been unable to attend personally to the duties of my station<barker_pb n="263"/>
with that activity which the service required—</hi>I believe however that all has
been done that could have been—I have at various times submitted the
question of storming the <location_mentioned>fortifications </location_mentioned>to a <person_mentioned>council of officers</person_mentioned> and they have
uniformly decided against it—<date_mentioned n="11-21-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>I was in hopes the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>was 
prepared to do it, and I issued a positive order, to storm at day light <date_mentioned n="11-22-1835">this 
morning</date_mentioned>, but on trial I found it impossible to get <person_mentioned>half the men</person_mentioned> willing for the
measure, and it was abandoned from necessity</p>

<p>I begin to doubt whether much more can be done here, than to leave a
<person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="Winter-1835">winter </date_mentioned>quarters</location_mentioned> at the <location_mentioned>missions below town</location_mentioned>, say <person_mentioned>250 men</person_mentioned>, untill the
necessary <person_mentioned>regular force</person_mentioned> and guns and other supplies, come out—</p>

<p>My health is better than it has been and is improving fast—I shall make
another effort to get the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>to storm if it cannot be effected, I shall leave
as many as will stay in <location_mentioned>winter quarters</location_mentioned> and go to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> under the 
appointment they have given me as <person_mentioned>commissioner</person_mentioned>— So far as my own wishes
and feelings are concerned, I much prefer an appointment out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
than in it—<hi rend="italic">I am ready to serve the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>in any way I can—I accepted
the appointment I now hold here, because I could not do otherwise, I never
sought it, nor wished for it—my constitution is too much worn out and too
feeble for the exposure and hardships and activity of a winters campaign,
destitute of everything like comforts</hi>. I have done the best I could This
<person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>has always been composed of discordant materials, and is without
proper organization—The <person_mentioned>volunteer </person_mentioned>sistem will not do for such a service,
I have had a hard and difficult task to perform—and am <hi rend="italic">really so worn
out,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">I begin to require rest</hi>— I could have been of more use in the
<person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>than here—and I can be of service to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by going to the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and I wish to go there.</p>

<p>Love to all— The <person_mentioned>boys </person_mentioned>are well—we are about <location_mentioned>600 yards from the 
fortifications</location_mentioned> and we have a battery within 340 yards but have no balls to do
much good—</p>

<p>This place must fall of itself in a short time—They are almost destitute
of supplies and but little hope, of getting tham from the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>soon—
If <person_mentioned>Genral Mexia</person_mentioned> has gone to attack <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>and succeeds, in taking that
place this one will fall of course—</p>

<p>As to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>affairs, much more depends at present on a proper 
regulation of the <person_mentioned>civil Govt</person_mentioned>, than on the military operations—</p>

<p>If there is unanimity and prudence and no <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>work, hi the <person_mentioned>civil 
department</person_mentioned>, all will go right the fate of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>depends mainly on this—we
ought to get united to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> as soon as possible, it is the best we can
do farewell</p>

<p>How I envy a poor and obscure man in his quiet cottage, free from care
and trouble and faction—A</p>

<p>We have cannonading every day. <date_mentioned n="11-22-1835">to day</date_mentioned> it has been very brisk for 
several hours—no harm has been done to any of our <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>—we hear that 
several have been <person_mentioned>killed </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>wounded </person_mentioned>inside one <person_mentioned>mexican soldier</person_mentioned> was killed
<date_mentioned n="11-22-1835">this morning</date_mentioned> who was attempting to reconnoiter our battery	<person_mentioned>S F A</person_mentioned></p>
