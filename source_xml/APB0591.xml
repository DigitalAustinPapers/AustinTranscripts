<p>Dear <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I have just received a letter addressed to you and presuming it
probable, that it may be of some importance to you, as to some
friend of yours, who wrote it, I have thought proper to enclose it to
you at <location_mentioned>Monteray</location_mentioned>. There being so little time, between receiving it,
and the departure of the mail, prevents me from entering into detail
of the passing events at this place, since your departure which must
be the subject of a subsequent letter.</p>

<p>I will, however, inform you, that nothing of material consequence,
has been done in <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>since you left here, the subject of calling
a new <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>has occupied, the whole of their time, nor have they
as yet decided that question, tho, it appears to be the general opinion
that the present <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>will decide in favour of convoking a new
one. <location_mentioned>Guadalaxara </location_mentioned>has declared that unless a new <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>is elected
that there will be a separation of that province, that they will declare
it, a free and independent <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>having determined not to obey the
present <person_mentioned>congress</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Reports says that <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Puebla </location_mentioned>are of the like sentiments.</p>

<p>What will the <person_mentioned>people of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> say of your <person_mentioned>Mexican
Congress</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>Emperor </person_mentioned>refused to have them, and now their 
<person_mentioned>constituents </person_mentioned>have refused them under those circumstances, who beside
the devil will have them.</p><barker_pb n="646"/>

<p>My business is before them, but when they will decide on it is
uncertain. Your friend <person_mentioned>[J. B.] Arispe</person_mentioned> is giving me all the aid in
his power.</p>

<p>An other revolution is strongly spoken of as being on the eve of
taken place the . . . [sic] and <person_mentioned>Uropean </person_mentioned>. . . [sic] against the 
<person_mentioned>republicans</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>As usual great alarm has been excited among some of the 
<person_mentioned>foreigners</person_mentioned>, who they are you will know without giving their names.</p>

<p>Since they intend making revolutions a trafic I say success to trade.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to inform you that I am enjoying good health
and shoud it continue, I think it more than probable, that I shall
return through the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>in company with our mutual friend
<person_mentioned>Arispe</person_mentioned>, who is anxious for me to do so.</p>

<p>Health and happiness attend you is the wish of
Yours sincerely</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Robert Leftwich</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] Al <person_mentioned>Sr. Dn Estevan F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Monterey Prova de
New Leon</location_mentioned></p>

<p>[On cover:] Since closing this letter I am informed that <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>
have to night decided on a new <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned></p>
