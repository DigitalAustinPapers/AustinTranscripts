<p>a few Days past <person_mentioned>Mr. Maxwell</person_mentioned> mentioned to me that he held a note of
mine and at the same time handed me your letter. <person_mentioned>Mr Maxwell</person_mentioned> 
observed that the intrested had liberty to either make payment or 
return the Concessions to me the concequences are the same I have not
a Dollar at Stake but as I had recd orders from some of the Intrested
not to make payment I requested from <person_mentioned>Mr Maxwell</person_mentioned> time to learne
the Determenation of the Gentlm after which I would Either make the
payment or Return the Concessions. I receiv'd from all the <person_mentioned>Gentlm</person_mentioned>-
for answer that the Concessions Should be returned for reasons-
following first that <person_mentioned>Mr Madden</person_mentioned> has made a Survey for an <person_mentioned>Indian boy</person_mentioned>
of <person_mentioned>Pratt</person_mentioned>s of a <location_mentioned>peice of Land</location_mentioned> he was informed two weeks before was
intended for <person_mentioned>Mr Shaw</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr Treat</person_mentioned> also after being made acquaint'd
Where <person_mentioned>Mr Stuart</person_mentioned> wish his Survey made he Survey [ed] a Concession
for some of his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>a preference being given to an
<person_mentioned>Indian Boy of Pratts</person_mentioned> After Messr <person_mentioned>Shaw </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Treat </person_mentioned>had paid one
Hundred and Twenty Dollars to some of the settlers of the <location_mentioned>Mine of
burton</location_mentioned> who have made some improvement on the land they intended
to take and which <person_mentioned>Madden </person_mentioned>surveyed by the <person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>not 
withstanding being for <person_mentioned>old Mr Duelle</person_mentioned> thus treated by a man you promis'd
Should execute your orders with out deviation has induced them to
suppose that this Conduct of <person_mentioned>Madden</person_mentioned>s meet your Approbation under
such impressions you are not to be surprised that they have Declaired
there dissattisfaction in the highest terms, what confidence is to be
given to <person_mentioned>Madden </person_mentioned>who the moment he had information Where the
<person_mentioned>Gentlm</person_mentioned>. in question wish'd there [concessions] Survey'd, immediately
made Surveys for Others on the same lands this with Other 
Considerations which I can communicate to you when an opportunity offers
has Determened them all to Return the Concessions As to myself I
have but One Observation to make and that is that I cannot 
sufficiently express my dissattisfaction with my Self, that I have had a
part in this business by which I have not onely recd from you a
Charge of Conduct of which I always shall Declair myself 
Blameless and have been Shamefully abus'd by your freind <person_mentioned>madden </person_mentioned>I have
given Great dissattisfaction to the Gentlm for whome I acted, all of
which has been brought about by a man altho your friend is 
uneversally Detested by the <person_mentioned>American People on the <location_mentioned>West Bank of the 
Mississippia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> notwithstanding I beleave your intentions have been always
to give Sattisfaction to Evry man yet your unbound'd confidance
in <person_mentioned>Madden </person_mentioned>and his friends has induced you to look on me as a man<barker_pb n="92"/>
unworthy of belief—and Capable of many improper thing haveing
as you was pleased to express yourself to a friend of yours Clouds
before my eyes which you have not been able to remove</p>
