<p>LETTER FROM <person_mentioned>COL. AUSTIN</person_mentioned></p>

<p><location_mentioned>Head Quarter</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>West Bank on the Guadalupe</location_mentioned></p>

<p><date_mentioned n="10-11-1835">October 11, 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Gentlemen,—On this day the <person_mentioned>volunteer troops of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will take up
the line of march for <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>. The whole number of the <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>does not
exceed <person_mentioned>three hundred men</person_mentioned>. We have hopes to be joined by a part of the 
<person_mentioned>detachment at <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, as an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>has been sent to them to join us <location_mentioned>on the
road</location_mentioned>. But some casualty may prevent this, as <person_mentioned>captain Collinsworth</person_mentioned> has
been ordered not to abandon the <location_mentioned>fort </location_mentioned>at that place.</p>

<p>I have, therefore, to request that you will use every exertion to press on
<person_mentioned>volunteers</person_mentioned>, who may come up with us in time to give us important, perhaps
indispensable, aid in the attack of <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Fail not to use every possible exertion in this respect, I beseech you. If
there is any intelligence of <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>coming up from <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, let an
<person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>be despatched to them immediately, begging them to hurry on by
forced marches to join us, and not to stay for the <location_mentioned>Tenoxtitlan </location_mentioned>cannon, or
for any thing. Let me request you further to send on, without delay,
wagons, with what ammunitions you can procure for cannon and small
arms—powder, lead, etc., also provisions, meal, beans, sugar and coffee,
and whatever else you may judge necessary for the <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>.
I have to inform you that <location_mentioned>Goliad </location_mentioned>was taken by <person_mentioned>captain Collinsworth</person_mentioned> on
the <date_mentioned n="10-08-1835">8th inst</date_mentioned>. with a <person_mentioned>force of fifty men</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Captains Smith</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Alley </person_mentioned>marched from here previous to my arrival,
with about <person_mentioned>one hundred and ten men,</person_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Victoria</location_mentioned>, which, it was reported,
had been attacked, and they have no doubt, formed a junction with <person_mentioned>captain
Collinsworth</person_mentioned>. As many of this <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>only as can be spared, so as not to
endanger the re-taking of <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, are expected by us; so that a 
<person_mentioned>reinforcement </person_mentioned>from <location_mentioned>that quarter</location_mentioned> is uncertain.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin, <hi rend="italic">Commander-in-chief.</hi></person_mentioned></p>
<p>To the <person_mentioned>Committee of Safety, <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>.
