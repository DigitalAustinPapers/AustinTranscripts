Needs one of those DTD header thingies
Change TEI.2 to TEI
Get rid of IDs in TEI and TEXT
Remove unmatched close title tag
Extensive refactoring of the TEI header.  Some elements 
need to go into titleStmt, some into profileStmt, some 
into publicationStmt.  In many cases the underscores should be 
converted into nesting elements

Text section notes:
P apparently used in place of a place_mentioned tag
location_mentioned needs to be converted, likely to placeName
date_mentioned n needs to be converted to date when
dates need to be converted to YYYY-MM-DD
person_mentioned needs to be converted to persName
barker_pb needs to be converted to pb

<p><persName>Mr. Samuel W. Williams</persName>,</p>

<p>Dear Sir I have received your esteemed of the<date when="1827-09-10"> 10th of 
September</date> by the way of <persName>Mr. Ybarra </persName>and to which I answer albut 
immediately. I learn in it, that you are very busy, and that the <placeName>colony</placeName>
has sufered a good deal of feaver, and that you have wrote to your
<persName>friends </persName>for the seeds in question etc <persName>Colonel Austin</persName> is here, en
<placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, and has talked with <persName>Ybarra </persName>on the subject of the seeds, and
I too, I had three large conversations with him on the subject of my
former letters to him advising him that I had renounced my project
of going to the <placeName>brazos</placeName>, as a <persName>minister</persName>, etc he upon the whole, was very
satisfied with me. But he told me that he should be glad if I would
go thither to establish a <placeName>Spanish school,</placeName> that he had solicited a
<persName>Spanish Master </persName>for that purpose in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and could obtain none,
that, at his arrival, he will try, (according to his wishes) to form a
<placeName>school</placeName>, to Justify a <persName>teacher</persName>, and he would write me the result, and
that in the meantime I would continue to write you both from time
to time. As he has told me that you take the <placeName>News paper called the
Eagle</placeName>, I shall tell you nothing of politics because you will see in<pb n="1710"/>
that paper all what is passing of interesting; altho I might advise
you to discontinue the subscription of that one to subscribe to <placeName>the
Sun</placeName> which is better and cheaper.</p>

<p>Since I have left <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>I was told by a good <persName>authority </persName>that the
<persName>Provisor </persName>has named a <persName>priest </persName>to go to yours parts, and the <persName>Colonel</persName>
told me he would go and see him on the subject.</p>

<p>This, Dear sir, is all what I can write worth of your notice, seing
that the <persName>Colonel </persName>will inform you of all and he will not difer his
return. in the meantime I remain your very respectfull and 
obedient servant</p>

<p><persName>Juan Francisco Buchetti</persName>.</p>

<p>N. B. if through leasure you oblige me to write me again Dirrect
me your letters through <persName>Mr Ybarra</persName> as you have done this last one</p>
<p><persName>J. F. B.</persName></p>
