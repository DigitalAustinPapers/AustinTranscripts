<p><person_mentioned>Mr. James F. Perry</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p>Aware of the great anxiety of yourself and <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>respecting our friend
<person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned>, I write you a few lines to inform you that I have by this mail
recd. a letter from him dated <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="03-14-1835">14th March</date_mentioned>, in which he says he is
well that his matters have not changed any and that he is still waiting an
amnesty law, and believes he shall so remain the <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1835">whole of that month</date_mentioned> at
least.</p>

<p>Not hearing from him for three mails (between this and <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>the mails
are weekly) myself and <person_mentioned>Companions </person_mentioned>had flattered ourselves with the hope
that he was on his road <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, because he expected to be released so as to
leave there about the <date_mentioned n="03-01-1835">first of March</date_mentioned>, and besides a Gentleman here received
a letter dated late in <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1835">February </date_mentioned>from <person_mentioned>Mr. Parrot</person_mentioned> in which he says "by
<person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned> who will leave in a few days for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>I will send you etc"
You may therefore judge our mortification on receiving information of
his still being detained aund under that chilling expectation of tomorrow
and after tomorrow. I must say that indignation was the predominant
feeling with me at what I conceive a tantalising persecution— I waited
upon the <person_mentioned>Govr</person_mentioned> made known to him the situation of my <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>and strongly
urged him to represent to the <person_mentioned>Genl. Govt</person_mentioned>. in his behalf. I am happy to
say he promised to do so and authorised me to say to the <person_mentioned>Col.</person_mentioned> that he
would do so by the next mail. I also expect to be able to obtain a
representation from the <person_mentioned>Congress of the State</person_mentioned> on the same head.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Col.</person_mentioned> complains of old <person_mentioned>Butler</person_mentioned> being his <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>. I hope we may
have the <person_mentioned>old dog</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>some day—and give him his due reward in these
matters. I have not time to give you a detail of the news, and must
therefore refer you to <person_mentioned>McKinney</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Chambers </person_mentioned>is here, and if I do not lay
him flat upon his back, it shall not be for the want of trial and I think I.
have the infidel on the hip.</p><barker_pb n="59"/>

<p>Present me kindly to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Perry</person_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>boys </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr. Pilgrim</person_mentioned> etc. and
believe me your friend etc</p>
