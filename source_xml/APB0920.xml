<p>Claim of late Dr. Robinson against Mexican Government, which he traded to William Alexander Danlin. European news.   Presidential election of 1824.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="11-21-1824">Novr 21st 1824</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I accidentally meet with the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Alcorn</person_mentioned>
who is going to Leave here in an hour. I have but little time to
write you and in a hurry to Bundle up for you a few <location_mentioned>News papers</location_mentioned>.
I have some time ago received from <person_mentioned>Mrs Robinson</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Widow of
the Late Doctor Robinson</person_mentioned> a power of Atty to pursue a Claim on the
<person_mentioned>Mexican Government</person_mentioned> for the Services of her <person_mentioned>Husband </person_mentioned>as <person_mentioned>Brigadier
General</person_mentioned> in the Service of that Government</p>

<p>When the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>left that Country his Account was settled and
the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>allowed him twenty thousand dollars, he became
acquainted with<person_mentioned> William Alexander Danlin</person_mentioned> who had been Sometime
in the Service of that Country. <person_mentioned>Mr Danlin</person_mentioned> informed the <person_mentioned>Doctor</person_mentioned>
that by the death of his <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>property had been left to him in
<location_mentioned>Mississippi </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Indiana </location_mentioned>in Lands and <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>to the value of
$20,000. he gave <person_mentioned>Dr Robinson</person_mentioned> a power to receive that property in
the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>Authorized him to Receive his
Claim on the <person_mentioned>Mexican Govt</person_mentioned> by way of Exchange; but the <person_mentioned>Doctor</person_mentioned>
Could never find any property of <person_mentioned>Danlin</person_mentioned>'s here; <person_mentioned>Mrs. Robinson</person_mentioned> is
Anxious to know if <person_mentioned>Danlin </person_mentioned>Recd the <person_mentioned>Doctor</person_mentioned>s Claim and if not
to Notify the proper department of the fraud of <person_mentioned>Danlin </person_mentioned>and to
prevent if possible his receiving it.—</p><barker_pb n="975"/>

<p>Now I have no doubt through some acquaintance you have in
<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>you can by writing Ascertain for her what it is important
for her to know, you will do me a favour if you will as soon as you
can attend to this subject.—</p>

<p>I have nothing important to inform you of that the <location_mentioned>News papers
</location_mentioned>will not acquaint you. the death of the <person_mentioned>king of France</person_mentioned> will produce no
Change. The state of affairs in <location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>is Horrid, and a most Bloddy
Revolution is looked for.— <person_mentioned>Count Artoi</person_mentioned> who will be <person_mentioned>Charles X</person_mentioned> the
<person_mentioned>Successor of Louis XVIII</person_mentioned> is Sixty seven and in Bad health his
successor will be <person_mentioned>Angoloeme</person_mentioned>.—</p>

<p>Who will be Our Next <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>no one knows and you can guess
as well as any one here—you will find the papers much taken up with
the visit of <person_mentioned>General Lafayette</person_mentioned>. History Certainly furnishes no 
parralell of such a Universal Burst of Gratefull expression by so many
Millions of People.—</p>

<p>I have lately seen a hand bill signed by <person_mentioned>Mr. Holtham a lawyer</person_mentioned> of
this place addressed to the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Taxas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> denouncing <person_mentioned>Mr John Cook
</person_mentioned>as a <person_mentioned>Swindler </person_mentioned>etc, I think it an act of justice to <person_mentioned>Mr Cook</person_mentioned> to inform
you that so far as I know those Charges are unfounded. <person_mentioned>Mr 
Nancanow</person_mentioned>(?) Introduced him here they came from <location_mentioned>Washita </location_mentioned>together,
and I have seen <person_mentioned>Genl Hughes</person_mentioned> and other gentlemen from <location_mentioned>Washita </location_mentioned>who
never intimated any thing to the prejudice of <person_mentioned>Mr Cook</person_mentioned>, when he left
here some Business of his were Unsettled particularly as <person_mentioned>Collector
of Taxes</person_mentioned>, his Bond was in my hands as <person_mentioned>president of the Town Police</person_mentioned>
and it was put in suit agt his securities in Compliance with a 
formality, but I do not believe he is much in arrears, the suit stands
Continued. <person_mentioned>Mr. Holtham</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr. Cook</person_mentioned> had a dispute and some
Blows passed between them they parted on bad terms. I believe few
persons here think the worse of <person_mentioned>Mr Cook</person_mentioned> or the better of <person_mentioned>Mr. 
Holtham</person_mentioned> for this attempt to injure him in a strange country. I ever
Regarded <person_mentioned>Mr. Cook</person_mentioned> as a temperate, sober genteal man, well quallified
for Business, he had my Confidence and might have it again.—</p>

<p>I Am always happy to hear from you, of the Welfare and the 
prosperity of your <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>—I have lately been informed you have
had an important accession of Territory Added to your former Grant,
including the <location_mentioned>Inlet and Bay of Galveston</location_mentioned>—I Now think I shall at
some future time Move and settle somewhere in <location_mentioned>Taxas</location_mentioned>: but to get
from where I have lived so long is difficult and much time is required
to arrange ones affairs—It is some time since I have had a letter
from you the last was by your <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>. I have written you several
since and sent you some <location_mentioned>News papers</location_mentioned>.—Our Legislature is in session
since Monday last, but we have not heard from them</p>
