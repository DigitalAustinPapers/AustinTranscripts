Conception</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>1/2 Miles From

<p>TO THE <person_mentioned>PRESIDENT OF THE CONVENTION OF <location_mentioned>TEXAS</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Sir,—I have the honor to inform you that the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>, to the number of
about three hundred <person_mentioned>cavalry </person_mentioned>and one hundred <person_mentioned>infantry</person_mentioned>, as nearly as can<barker_pb n="217"/>
be ascertained, with two pieces of cannon, at sunrise <date_mentioned n="10-28-1835">this morning</date_mentioned>, attacked
a <person_mentioned>detachment from the army</person_mentioned>, consisting of ninety <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>, under the command
of <person_mentioned>colonel Bowie</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>captain Fanning</person_mentioned>, who were posted at this place; and
after a warm engagement of three hours, were repulsed with the loss of one
piece of cannon, (a six-pounder) and about thirty muskets, sixteen <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>
left dead <location_mentioned>on the field</location_mentioned>, and, from the best accounts, nearly as many more
were carried off. The number of <person_mentioned>wounded </person_mentioned>we can only conjecture, with
the exception of two that remained <location_mentioned>on the field</location_mentioned>. It is with great regret I
have to say, that on our side we had one man, <person_mentioned>Richard Andrews, of <location_mentioned>Mina</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>,
dangerously wounded—I fear mortally. But we have sustained no other
loss, except a few horses.</p>

<p>The main body of the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>came up, in about thirty minutes after the
<person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>had retired. A more circumstantial account of this action, which
has resulted so gloriously to the <person_mentioned>federal army</person_mentioned>, and more particularly to the
individuals immediately engaged, will be given as soon as it can be
made out.</p>

<p>The overwhelming superiority of force, and the brilliancy of the victory
gained over them, speak for themselves in terms too expressive to require
from me any further eulogy</p>

<p>I have just learned that the <person_mentioned>cavalry of the enemy</person_mentioned> was commanded by
<person_mentioned>colonel Ugartechea</person_mentioned>, and the <person_mentioned>infantry </person_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>colonel Mariano Cos</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>brother of
the general, Martin Perfecto</person_mentioned>.</p>
