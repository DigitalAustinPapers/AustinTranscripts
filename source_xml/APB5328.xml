<p><location_mentioned>Columbia Texas</location_mentioned>: <date_mentioned n="12-07-1836">Decr. 7. 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Permit me as briefly as may be—to submit to you the following 
Circumstances and facts relative to the Emigration of Myself and <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and little
<location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—To Wit,</p>

<p>1.—Before	we left <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned>, I occupied nearly 2 years in diligent 
exertions for the benefit of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>:—1st. In publishing, in various <location_mentioned>News Papers</location_mentioned>
all the valuable information which had ever appeared on the subject, with
many original communications: which, and with a variety of incidental
Expenses, in reference to my <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, cost me more than $200.</p>

<p>2.—I	have been the direct <person_mentioned>Agent </person_mentioned>of sending here at least 20 <person_mentioned>Volunteers</person_mentioned>—
probably more.-</p>

<p>3.—Also,	20, or 25 <person_mentioned>Families</person_mentioned>; besides those (15) last which I brought
with me.-</p>

<p>4.	We should all have been in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by the <date_mentioned n="04-01-1836">1st. of April, last</date_mentioned>;—but for
the unavoidable Delays; etc, on account of the unsettled state of the 
<location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, having been <hi rend="italic">advised </hi>to remain etc—</p>

<p>5.—We	have all—generally—suffered most severely from <hi rend="italic">Sickness</hi>, and
from want of <hi rend="italic">employment Sufficient</hi> to <hi rend="italic">sustain </hi>ourselves:—so that,—</p>

<p>6.—Of	our whole Number, 5 have Died (viz 2 <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>and 3 <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Heads
of Families</person_mentioned>; 2 of whom left <person_mentioned>Widows </person_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>Children</person_mentioned>.) 1. <person_mentioned>Mrs. Kent</person_mentioned>, (a<barker_pb n="471"/>
most valuable young family:)—has no <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>. (What can be done
for her?)</p>

<p>7.—Hence,	in sustaining myself and family, and <person_mentioned>Colonists</person_mentioned>, during our
long <hi rend="italic">detention </hi>my <hi rend="italic">Expenses </hi>have exceeded $1.800-</p>

<p>8.—Nevertheless,	the <hi rend="italic">remains </hi>of my <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>—together with my own
<person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>I shall be able to bring into <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>;—<hi rend="italic">that is,</hi> as soon
as I can go and return from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>; <hi rend="italic">they all</hi> being prepared on the
shortest notice: <hi rend="italic">Provided</hi>, I can <hi rend="italic">now ascertain where to locate them.</hi></p>

<p>9.	as soon as I can bring into <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>those of my <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>who are now
<hi rend="italic">in </hi>and <hi rend="italic">about </hi><location_mentioned>N: Orleans</location_mentioned>, I can, If necessary—Very soon make up the
Number who have been removed by Death &c as follows:—2 <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>now
in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, living near <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>; and have been there for some time,
awaiting our Location in order to join us; who did not, originally, belong
to my present <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>; and whom I sent on nearly 1 year ago:—and 21y—
at least 100 <person_mentioned>Families </person_mentioned>of good character, enterprising, and of <hi rend="italic">property 
</hi>sufficient to bear their own Expenses here, and also, to <hi rend="italic">buy </hi>their own <hi rend="italic">Land</hi>, 
residing in the <location_mentioned>Western parts of New York</location_mentioned>, who are <hi rend="italic">ready </hi>and <hi rend="italic">anxious </hi>to join
us in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>; and, <hi rend="italic">who will</hi> do so, the moment I <hi rend="italic">notify </hi>them that <hi rend="italic">we </hi>have
settled here, and are <hi rend="italic">pleased </hi>with the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>:— (This is—however, much
too <hi rend="italic">small </hi>an estimate:)</p>

<p>10.—The	"<person_mentioned>General Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, of the
Church in the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>", have already made <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></hi>a <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Missionary Station</location_mentioned></hi>,
with a view to <hi rend="italic">my own appointment</hi> as their <hi rend="italic">Missionary</hi>: and which they
have likewise <hi rend="italic">Resolved </hi>to do, <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as I shall be <hi rend="italic">Located </hi>in the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>
and <hi rend="italic">actually engaged</hi> in my Professional duties.</p>

<p>11.—Therefore, our immediate <hi rend="italic">Settlement </hi>in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, is <hi rend="italic">all-important—</hi>
in regard to the <hi rend="italic">interests and welfare—of my self and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>;</hi> and, indeed
a <hi rend="italic">failure </hi>to do so,—after our severe trials and great <hi rend="italic">Expenses</hi>—would be
direct and total <hi rend="italic">ruin to us all!</hi></p>

<p>12.—Finally—notwithstanding	the above facts and circumstances—[if]
I have, thus far, been of any valuable service to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,—I rejoice; and I
shall still be happy to render her any benefit in my power; either 
Professionally or otherwise; looking for no other reward, than to be allowed to
Locate my own family and the other <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>with me, agreeably to the
Terms of my Original Contract with you of Nov. 28, 1833.</p>

<p>13.—The whole <hi rend="italic">Expense</hi>, which I have incurred in regard to my <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>,
up to the present time, <hi rend="italic">exceeds </hi>$4,500.</p>

<p>14.	Finally; let me entreat you—(such is the divided state of public
opinion here:—so many different & conflicting <hi rend="italic">interests </hi>and, so numerous,
unreasonable, and <hi rend="italic">contradictory </hi>are the <hi rend="italic">Interpretations </hi>given—even by our
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Legislators</person_mentioned></hi>—to the <hi rend="italic">Colonization Laws</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">Let me entreat you</hi>, respectfully
and most earnestly, to explain to me the <hi rend="italic">real facts</hi> and circumstances of the<barker_pb n="472"/>
case, regarding the <hi rend="italic">Location </hi>of <hi rend="italic">my own</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Families </person_mentioned></hi>with me, 
agreeably to those Laws, in the 1st. place; and 21y—What <hi rend="italic">you, yourself</hi>, will be
able to <hi rend="italic">do for us</hi>,—if anything: <hi rend="italic">Lastly</hi>: what <hi rend="italic">I had best do</hi> situated as I
<hi rend="italic">now </hi>am?____________&c &c—I am Dr Sir, with great Respect,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>R. Salmon</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] To Whom it May Concern <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Genl. Austin</person_mentioned></hi>....<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>
