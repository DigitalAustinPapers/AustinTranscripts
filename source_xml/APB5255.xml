<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Genl</person_mentioned>.,</p>

<p>I have but a few moments to write, but in these few, I wish to tell you,
that from the sign of the times you can not be elected, unless you or some
friend comes out in a <location_mentioned>circular </location_mentioned>to the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>. The lamented land speculation
is operating against you. Many have been led to believe that you are
concerned.</p>

<p>I have just returned from <location_mentioned>Fort Bend</location_mentioned>, and some of your <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">old </hi>devoted
friends</person_mentioned> say, they can not support you unless they are convinced that you
had no hand in the big land purchase. They say, if you will tell them you
have not, they will believe you.</p>

<p>It is easy for your <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>to make use of this vile plea to ruin your
election. It is necessary, therefore, that some thing should be said on this
subject. I know how much this affair has tormented your soul, and it is
due to yourself as well as to the <person_mentioned>public </person_mentioned>that you make a positive denial of
having anything to do with what is called land speculation. I have, when
speaking of this affair offered to pledge my life on the question; that is, I
would give my life, if at any time it should be found that you were engaged
in the affair</p>

<p>Let us know what you wish done and believe me</p>

<p><person_mentioned>G. Borden. Jr</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Genl. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Brazoria Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>
