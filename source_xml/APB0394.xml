<p><location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned>, July 1, 1821.</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I am now this far on my journey to the <location_mentioned>Province of
Texas</location_mentioned>, to take possession of the lands granted to my <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Col.
Moses Austin</person_mentioned>, (formerly of <location_mentioned>Mine a Burton, Missouri</location_mentioned>) by the <person_mentioned>Spanish
government</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The land lies on the <location_mentioned>Colorado and Brassos rivers</location_mentioned>, and includes a
situation on the <location_mentioned>Bay of St. Bernard</location_mentioned>, suitable for a <location_mentioned>sea-port</location_mentioned>, at which
place a <location_mentioned>port of entry</location_mentioned> is ordered to be established. This concession
to my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>is granted by <person_mentioned>Don Joaquin de Arredondo the governor
of the <location_mentioned>Internal Provinces</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and is duly confirmed by the <person_mentioned>Supreme
Council of those <location_mentioned>Provinces</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> dated <date_mentioned n="01-17-1821">17th January, 1821</date_mentioned>, at <location_mentioned>Monterey</location_mentioned>.
It contains a permission to settle <person_mentioned>three hundred families</person_mentioned> on the lands
to each of whom a tract of land is to be given and to whom most
liberal privileges are secured, both in regard to commercial 
intercourse and civil rights.</p>

<p>The Constitution of <location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>is in full operation at those provinces
and recent accounts state that the beneficial effects of it are already
perceptible.</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>gold and silver mines</location_mentioned> are getting into more extensive 
operation than they have for many years. Money is becoming more
abundant, a free trade is permitted, and the restrictive system 
heretofore pursued in regard to <person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>has been superseded by the most
liberal encouragement.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Don Joseph Erasmo Seguin</person_mentioned>, a Spanish gentleman from <location_mentioned>San
Antonio</location_mentioned> was despatched by <person_mentioned>governor Martinez</person_mentioned> for the express 
purpose of informing my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>of the confirmation of his <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>by the
<person_mentioned>governor general</person_mentioned>, and to invite back all the <person_mentioned>fugitive Spaniards</person_mentioned> who
fled in the revolution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1812">1812</date_mentioned>, and are living at this place, most of
whom, I am informed, will return to their country again.</p>

<p>I go in company with <person_mentioned>Don Erasmo</person_mentioned>, and have a large company of
<person_mentioned>American companions</person_mentioned> besides the <person_mentioned>Spaniards</person_mentioned></p>.

<p>Should you yet meet with any <person_mentioned>Farmers </person_mentioned>of good character or
<person_mentioned>mechanics</person_mentioned>, who wish to emigrate to this fine country and participate
in the advantages secured to my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>by this <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>, you will oblige
me by informing them that they can procure every information on
this subject by writing to my <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Herculaneum, Missouri</location_mentioned>; but
they must be well recommended.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
