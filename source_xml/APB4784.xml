<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Perry</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>There is an effort making for a new <hi rend="italic">fus </hi>and <person_mentioned>Wharton </person_mentioned>told me <person_mentioned>S. M Ws
[Williams']</person_mentioned> name was to one of the <person_mentioned>fire brand</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Circulars </location_mentioned>appended to the
govs proclamation The proclamation is well enough,</p>

<p>It only calls upon the people to support the supremacy of the laws,
But the article appended to it is, a tissue of falsehoods, got up 
apparently to break up <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>and prevent the repeal of the 400 league law
so that they may retain their speculation</p>

<p>It asserts that the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned> are determined to ruin <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and desire all
the <person_mentioned>N americans</person_mentioned> out of it—that they are about to seperate <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>from
<location_mentioned>Coahuilla </location_mentioned>and make it a <location_mentioned>Military Commandancy</location_mentioned>, for the purpose of having
it in their power to represent to the people that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is peopled with
<person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>and that then the <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>will in consideration of commercial
priveleges help them to conquer the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>etc Calls upon the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>
to take arms at once for self preservation etc now this is all <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>
<person_mentioned>Stephens </person_mentioned>last letter gives the lie to all of it—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gray the printer</person_mentioned> has got a copy and as usual it will come out in the
next paper— It will be a dead stopper to immigration and Sales of land
and throw us back 2 years at least.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject I think the publication of those parts of
<person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned>s letter which I marked with a pencil all important to appear in
<hi rend="italic">the next paper</hi> to Counteract this incendiary paper If you can get them
to the press this week even at some trouble and expense I beg you will do
so if you view the subject as I do</p>

<p>Cordially your friend</p>

<p>who sends many afft expressions to <person_mentioned>cousin Emilly</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Henry Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>PS In the flour case today the <person_mentioned>Jury of <hi rend="italic">Talis men</hi></person_mentioned> pickd up in <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned>,
Were charged by the <person_mentioned>Judge </person_mentioned>that he considered the evidence of the <person_mentioned>Patroon
of the boat</person_mentioned> equivalent to a bill of lading</p>

<p>That <person_mentioned>Jury </person_mentioned>found the fact that <person_mentioned>Hall </person_mentioned>took the flour to his own use But
as <person_mentioned>Mr Davis</person_mentioned> swore that at the request of Hall he had charged a bbl of flour
delivd <person_mentioned>Jamieson </person_mentioned>on <person_mentioned>Captn A</person_mentioned>['s] order to him <person_mentioned>Hall </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>plaintif </person_mentioned>had recd no
Damage and must pay the costs</p>

<p>God save the people from a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>Jury</person_mentioned> Had the yeomanry been at
their post this would not have occurred, It has determined me to put my
household Gods in a place of safety off hand, in the dark vale</p>
