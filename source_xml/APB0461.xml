<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I arrived here last night not as much Fatigued as I expected;
<person_mentioned>Henry Elliott</person_mentioned>, arrived the night before he left us at <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Cany Creek</location_mentioned></hi>
where we lost one of our horses—which detained us several hours—</p>

<p>I went by <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mc Donald</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> for the horse but did not get him—the
horse had been stollen nearly two Years—I have examined the 
invoice of Goods left at this place— and find but few that would 
answer— and what few would answer it is impossible for me to take
on, for the want of a horse-— and time to pack the Goods— the notes
you gave me I shall leave in <person_mentioned>Mr. Ashley</person_mentioned>s Hands for Collection— as
you directed— I see in the invoice— 1 brass and one silver watch
also 1 Gun that had been lent out untill nearly ruined— If I do take
on any of the Goods they will be Madrass Hani (?) and some Beads
however there is but a poor probability of my taking on any— as
<person_mentioned>Mr. Eliott</person_mentioned> is so anxious to get on as fast as possible that if I was
not ready he would not wait a moment for me</p>

<p>He got a letter from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> a day or two later than yours;
<person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>wished everything belonging to <person_mentioned>Fathers Estate</person_mentioned> sent to<barker_pb n="459"/>
<location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>consigned to <person_mentioned>Hawkins</person_mentioned>— I shall place the things in <person_mentioned>Mr.
Ashley</person_mentioned>'s care and he will send them down the first opportunity—</p>

<p>As I have not time to pack up Your Goods I shall leave all as I
found them if <person_mentioned>Mr Eliott</person_mentioned> sends goods to (Means I expect that
Yours will go on also.</p>

<p>The notes on <person_mentioned>Crow </person_mentioned>I shall take on with me but the rest I leave
here as before stated— If I had time and horse I would certainly
take on the quantity of Goods You directed— I would do anything
to promote Your Interest that lay in my Power—but as it is 
impossible for me <hi rend="italic">to take them on</hi>—I hope You will [not] impute it to
negligence on my part</p>

<p>We will have corn to pack a considerable distance and two horse [s]
would be Exquisite for <hi rend="italic">that </hi>alone— I have nothing more to say
except that I am well pleased with the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned><person_mentioned> Mr and Mrs
Ashly</person_mentioned> are well also the <person_mentioned>Doc </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Family</person_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Mrs Ashly</person_mentioned> desires her
love to <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and will write her shortly love to <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>sister</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. do not forget the certificate but send it on as soon as 
possible.</p>
