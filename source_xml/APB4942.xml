<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I heard of your crossing <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>, in company with a good number
hope you are now at <location_mentioned>head quarter</location_mentioned>, assisting there, we rely with much 
confidence on the taking of <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>Our numbers certainly are sufficiently
Strong for 500 <person_mentioned>Mexicans</person_mentioned>. Please to recollect we have not a man to lose,
but must calculate on gaining our Victories with out loss. I understand
that <person_mentioned>Coss </person_mentioned>wrote you to <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>, requesting to See you in <location_mentioned>San an Tone</location_mentioned>;
but I hope your prudence will dictate to you that if you See him it will
be when he is a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>. I think if <person_mentioned>Coss </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned>could be defeated
and made <person_mentioned>prisoners</person_mentioned>, we would have time after that event to be in 
readiness for the next attack. I think the only chance in our situation is to fight
them from the <location_mentioned>Brush</location_mentioned>, fight them from the <location_mentioned>Brush </location_mentioned>all the time; never take
<person_mentioned>our Boys</person_mentioned> to an open fight our Situation will not admit of it. all must
be deciplind before,we can fight in the <location_mentioned>open field</location_mentioned></p>
