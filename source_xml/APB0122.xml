<p><location_mentioned>Middletown </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="08-20-1807">20th Augt. 1807</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you on my first arrival here directed to <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>, since
which I have not written, not knowing where my Letters would find
you— But from a Letter received a few days since from <person_mentioned>Mr. T.
Phelps</person_mentioned>, it appears that you have given up all idea of coming to this
part of the Country, he mentions that <person_mentioned>Austin Eliot</person_mentioned> left <location_mentioned>St. Geneveive</location_mentioned>
about the <date_mentioned n="07-01-1807">1st July</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>— I hope he will be here soon, as
I feel quite impatient to be in readiness to go on as soon as it will be
prudent to go.—</p>

<p>I was disappointed in getting the Money for <person_mentioned>Miss Penniman</person_mentioned>'s
Dft.—   The property was not sold—</p>

<p>I went to <location_mentioned>New London</location_mentioned> soon after I came home to see her <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>
about it.— He told me there was no prospect of selling it, and it
would be uncertain whether he should be able to dispose of it before I
got away—In consequence of not receiving it, I have been unable to
make any arangements about getting away, as the Money I brought
with me, was not Sufficient to settle all the accounts that I had against
me when I came home— When <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>comes, we shall get ready to
go on with all possible dispatch.—</p>

<p>I hope to get away in <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1807">September</date_mentioned>, but cannot fix on any time, till
he comes— I was quite disappointed to find that you were not
coming—</p>

<p>I hope <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>will come well provided with the needfull, as it will
be necessary to have considerable more than what we shall want for
the purchase of our Goods, to bear expences of Transportation etc—
<person_mentioned>Mr. Phelps</person_mentioned> mentions that you have made arrangements to have his
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>go on with us, and let <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>take charge of the Goods to
<location_mentioned>Pitsburgh</location_mentioned>, and that <person_mentioned>Mr Beers</person_mentioned> will furnish us with Money to carry
us on.—   I think we shall get along very pleasantly in that way—</p>

<p>When I came home I found my <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>at House Keeping— It
is much cheaper living here than in <location_mentioned>New Haven</location_mentioned>, yet it costs a good
deal to support a <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>anywhere— I shall want 2 or 8 Hundd.
Dollars to close my accounts and purchase Clothing and other 
necessaries to take on with us—</p><barker_pb n="135"/>

<p>I have been informed by a <person_mentioned>Gentleman from <location_mentioned>New London</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, that
<location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Miss Penniman</person_mentioned>'s</location_mentioned> House was sold (about 3 week's since) for One
thousand Dolls—</p>

<p>If I can get that, I shall be able to get along very well, but as I
have not heard from <person_mentioned>Mr. Penniman</person_mentioned> on the Subject it is uncertain
whether I shall get it or not, as I dont know that he has sold it for
Cash— I shall not be able to get <person_mentioned>Betsey</person_mentioned>'s things for her unless I
get the Money—</p>

<p>I sent her Memorandum to her Brother—He wrote for it, and
said she requested him to assist in getting them— He will probably
get part of them—</p>

<p>I have not heard from <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>for some time— I intended going
to see him soon after I came home, but have been so short of Cash,
that I had none to spare to go anywhere from home— He intends
entering Colledge this <date_mentioned n="Fall-1807">Fall</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Beers</person_mentioned> told me when I first came home that <person_mentioned>Mr. Adams</person_mentioned> had
called on him for 50 Dollars, but he had no money in his hands— I
[should] have given him an Hundred Dollars, if I had received
that at <location_mentioned>New London</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Elisha Austin</person_mentioned> is making arrangements to go on with us</p>—

<p><person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>is daily expected.—</p>

<p>I have not received a line from you or any body in <location_mentioned>Louisianna</location_mentioned>
(except <person_mentioned>Mr Phelps</person_mentioned>,) since I left it— I hope since the appointment
of a Governor, that all is peace and quietness</p>

<p>Please remember us to <person_mentioned>Aunt</person_mentioned>, and all friends—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>H. Austin </person_mentioned>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Moses Austin Esqr</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Mine a'Burton</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Upper 
Louisianna</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>Office at St Genevieve</location_mentioned></p>
