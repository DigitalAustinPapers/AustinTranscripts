<p><person_mentioned>Genl. S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>Dr Sir. I have heard with pleasure of Your return
from Our <person_mentioned>Army</person_mentioned>, knowing as I do the materials of which the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>is 
composed, I mean the insubordination, and the impossibility of keeping up any<barker_pb n="281"/>
thing like discipline, in the absence of all Law, I do think my d Sir, that
You did err'd materially in the appointment of Your <person_mentioned>Staff</person_mentioned>. You placed
Men in Office that would stop, at nothing short of Your ruin etc etc
The proceedings of the whole <person_mentioned>Convention </person_mentioned>proves to my mind the old
adage that give Men power and they will help themselves—they have made
appointments which will down the<person_mentioned> Whartons</person_mentioned> in our <location_mentioned>Section</location_mentioned>, say the appt.
of <person_mentioned>L. C. Manson as 1st. Judge in our <location_mentioned>district</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—agst. which there will be a
strong and very public remonstrance, as will many Others, known to
Yrself—</p>

to his land.]</p>
