<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>your favour of the <date_mentioned n="05-12-1824">25 ultmo</date_mentioned> was duly received. I am very sorry
for the arangments which has taken place that will prove a private
injury to you, but I flatter myself that it may yet turn out better<barker_pb n="829"/>
than you first antisipated, You state that you intend to close all
the affairs of the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>by the month of <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1824">October</date_mentioned>, I sincerely
hope you have no intention of leaving the <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, such a step
would be (I think) ruinous to the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>-—I am clearly of oppinion
from my own knowledg that their never was a man more 
universally beloved and respected by all the <person_mentioned>setlers </person_mentioned>than yourself, it would
be like leaving so many Orphan Children without protection.—In
my last letter to you by <person_mentioned>Mr. Cummings</person_mentioned> I wrote my real oppinion
to you of <person_mentioned>Capt Gains</person_mentioned>'s carractor. I reflected on my self after I
sent it for fear you might think I was endeavouring to traduce the
Man. The last dispute I had with him I told him the business
between him and myself was like an old sore healing up I did not
wish to tear it open afresh, since then he stops at my <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>eats
and drinks I do the same at his <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>, so far we are <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>but I
still think it my duty to prevent him from deceiving others as he
has me, on his return from <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> he spoke very ill against
the <person_mentioned>Political Chief</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>counsel </person_mentioned>stating that he was fifteen days 
disputing with them in supporting the <person_mentioned>American settlers</person_mentioned> in this 
<location_mentioned>District</location_mentioned>, but gave no correct information respecting the intentions of
Government about this <location_mentioned>district</location_mentioned>, Since that time a <person_mentioned>Spaniard </person_mentioned>has
passed through here from <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> and who is said to be a good
Man—his name is sounded, <person_mentioned>Hose Ankle [José Angel]</person_mentioned> he informed me
that <person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>while at <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> spoke very bad of all the <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>
in this <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>. I since lern that he gave <person_mentioned>Col Bean</person_mentioned> the same 
account but spoke more fully to him as he speaks Spanish well, since
that time some <person_mentioned>setlers </person_mentioned>from the <location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned>has passed here and inform
the <person_mentioned>Inhabitants </person_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Don Jose Anto Saucedo</person_mentioned> while at the <location_mentioned>Brassos</location_mentioned>
gave you the same information and go so far as to relate your
answer—</p>

<p>I wish you to write me and inform if this is true the people here all
believe it. if true, I feel confident that you would be among the last
men that would attempt to screen a man that was capible of such
disception.</p>

<p>We are here quite ignorant of the late regulations of Government
respecting this <location_mentioned>District </location_mentioned>the papers that have come on have been 
translated by <person_mentioned>Col Bean</person_mentioned> but so badly that we can make but little sence of
it, there is many reports we do not know what to believe I will take
it as a great favour if you will give me such information as you
may possess on this subject, that I may know what to depend on
I think that <person_mentioned>Saucedo </person_mentioned>must have conversed with you on this subject
such part as you wish to be considered as confidential you will please
to name—by complying with this request you will add to the many
obligations that I have the pleasure to acknowledge—</p>
