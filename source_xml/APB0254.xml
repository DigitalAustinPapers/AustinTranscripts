<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am anxious to obtain and as soon as possible all the information
which can be had in relation to the <location_mentioned>lead mines</location_mentioned>—and I know of no
person better able to give correct information on the subject [than]
yourself—any ideas you may think proper to communicate as to the
manner of leasing the <location_mentioned>public mineral lands</location_mentioned> will be very acceptable
to me—</p>

<p>I wish to be informed as to the present prices given for mineral—
the profits to be derived from smelting—the probable revenue to be
derived to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> from leasing—what the prices of 
mineral lead were before and since the war—go into as much detail in
your communication as you can find it convenient to make—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>house of Representatives</person_mentioned> are now engaged in discussing the
Bill for the establishment of a <person_mentioned>national bank</person_mentioned>—to revive the public
credit which at present appears to be at a low ebb— As soon as the
fiscal concerns are accomplished we may expect immediate provisions
in detail for raising an <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>as I hope sufficient to expel entirely the
<person_mentioned>British </person_mentioned>from the <location_mentioned>Continent </location_mentioned>and to coerce the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>to friendly
intercourse and [mutilated] us— I think <person_mentioned>Mr. Munroe</person_mentioned>s first plan
[an] admirable one— By reading the [debates] of <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>some of
which I shall send you on the subject of the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>[you] will better
discover the state and condition of the <person_mentioned>Banks </person_mentioned>on <location_mentioned>this side of the
mountains</location_mentioned> —than I can inform you by letter Suffice it to say in
this place you cannot get a picaun in silver and bills for one cent are
in circulation No one bank will receive the paper of another 
without a discount of from 10 to 12 per cent.—</p>

<p>I had not arrived when the first section of the Bill to incorporate
the <person_mentioned>U. S. bank</person_mentioned> was under consideration in committee of the whole—
The <location_mentioned>territories </location_mentioned>had all been omitted I succeeded to day in one
amendment authorising the <person_mentioned>directors </person_mentioned>to establish <location_mentioned>offices </location_mentioned>where soever
they shall think fit in the <location_mentioned>territories </location_mentioned>for the purposes of discount
deposit and distribution—and think it would be much better if they<barker_pb n="243"/>
were compelled by the law to establish one such <location_mentioned>office </location_mentioned>in each <location_mentioned>state</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned>whenever a certain amount of the capital stock should
be subscribed in such <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>territory</location_mentioned>— the object would be to
prevent the specie from going out of the <location_mentioned>State </location_mentioned>into the <person_mentioned>Mother Bank
at <location_mentioned>Philadelphia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—but you might as well kick agt the pricks as to 
attempt it— It will however be strongly urged I suspect— I shall
try to [have the] first section so amended as to have [offices?] for 
subscription opened within our <location_mentioned>territory</location_mentioned>— Write me often your ideas
[on] these and other subjects which may occur</p>

<p><person_mentioned>R Easton </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>Be pleased to present my best respects to <person_mentioned>Mrs Austin</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan</person_mentioned> and to <person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I send you a Bank bill for five Cents.—</p>

<p>[Addressed:]   <person_mentioned>Moses Austin Esquire Post Master</person_mentioned>  <location_mentioned>Mine Potosi
Washington County Missouri Territory</location_mentioned></p>
