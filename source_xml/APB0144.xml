<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>It has not been in my power to procure for you the articles that
you requested—they could have been obtained had I been authorised
to have drawn on <person_mentioned>Chs. Carr </person_mentioned>at six months—but nothing could be
done, to pay in <location_mentioned>N Orleans</location_mentioned> at nine months—the shortest time at which
you authorised me to engage for you, I regret all this, as you may in
consequence be much disappointed.—</p>

<p>Inclosed is the memorandum of <person_mentioned>Mr. Meriault</person_mentioned>s acct., handed me by
<person_mentioned>Capt. Sterrett</person_mentioned>, which it was my intention to have inclosed to you in
my letter of <date_mentioned n="07-16-1808">Saturday</date_mentioned>.—</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="07-21-1808">Tomorrow Morning</date_mentioned> I sail in the ship Orleans for <location_mentioned>Philadelphia</location_mentioned>
I shall write you from thence, immediately after my arrival.</p>

<p>I have nothing to add to my former observations—but to request
that you will keep me regularly and fully informed on all the 
subjects in which I am interested in <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned>—Pray what has become
of <person_mentioned>Smith</person_mentioned>s suit against me?</p>

<p>Compliments to all our <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>—and accept for yourself the 
renewed assurance of my high Esteem and personal attachment—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Seth Hunt</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Moses Austin</person_mentioned></p>
