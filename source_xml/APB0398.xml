<p><location_mentioned>Republic of Texas</location_mentioned></p>,
<p><location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-20-1821">July 20, 1821.</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir—I wrote you fully from <location_mentioned>Nachitoches</location_mentioned>, relative to the
confirmation of my <location_mentioned>father's grant</location_mentioned> by the <location_mentioned>governor general</location_mentioned>, and
<person_mentioned>council of the four internal province</person_mentioned>, enclosing you copies of the
documents delivered me by <person_mentioned>Don Erasmo, the agent on the part of
the Spanish government</person_mentioned>, and who is authorized to conduct myself
and <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>lands granted</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>We are thus far on our way to explore the country, and select the
most judicious sites for our <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>We found several <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>at this place, who held a council upon
our arrival, and resolved to remove within the limits of the lands
granted my father; the inducements to their removal being the
advantages of a situation nigher to the sea, and consequently to the
<location_mentioned>seat of trade</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have not the boundaries of the grant before me, but understand
it will include the <location_mentioned>harbor of Mata Gorda</location_mentioned>, and the <location_mentioned>mouth of the
Colorado river</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I met here a gentleman who travelled through the grant, and who
assures me it is the richest and best watered part of the province.
All <person_mentioned>travellers </person_mentioned>unite with our much lamented <person_mentioned>Gen. Pike</person_mentioned>, in alleging
the climate to be one of the most delightful in this, or any other
country</p>.

<p>I had both verbal and written correspondence with a number of
gentlemen who proposed to migrate to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and become <location_mentioned>settlers</location_mentioned><barker_pb n="403"/>
within the <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>.   As I have not leisure to write them all, be pleased
to make known through the public prints:</p>

<p>1st. That I shall comply with the condition of the <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>, and
effect the settlement to the full extent, and in the same manner
contemplated by my late <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned></p>.

<p>2d. That I shall explore the country, and then select the most
judicious points for our <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>3d. That a port has been established by the proper authority, in
the <location_mentioned>Bay of St. Bernard</location_mentioned>, which will at once secure great facilities
to commerce.</p>

<p>4th. That I am authorized to introduce and settle on the <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>,
<person_mentioned>three hundred families</person_mentioned>; and they are permitted to carry with them
all the property, effects and supplies they think proper.</p>

<p>5th. That every facility will be given calculated to aid the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>,
and they will be secured in grants of land proportionate to the
numbers of each <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, and the force or means they possess of 
carrying on useful and agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>Liberal grants of land will also be made to mechanics of all 
descriptions who will become <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>; but no settler will be received,
or grant made to any individual, who does not produce satisfactory
evidence of good character and industrious habits; and the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
will supply themselves with certificates to this effect from some court,
<person_mentioned>magistrate</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>mayor</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>justice</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>notary</person_mentioned>, or other <person_mentioned>public officer</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The objects of this settlement are entirely agricultural. The 
richness of the soil, healthfulness of the climate, contiguity to the sea,
and other natural advantages, promising a reward to our labors,
which few spots on the globe could furnish to an equal extent</p>.

<p>I shall return to <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned>, by the <date_mentioned n="09-25-1821">25th Sept</date_mentioned>. and
after a visit to <location_mentioned>Herculaneum</location_mentioned>, in the state of <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned>, shall proceed
with the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>to the points of location.</p>

<p>All persons desiring information, will address me at " 
<location_mentioned>Herculaneum, Missouri</location_mentioned>," and their letters shall be answered immediately
on my reaching that place.—As the communications will be numerous,
it is expected that the <person_mentioned>applicants </person_mentioned>for information will pay the 
postage on their letters.</p>

<p>I will publish on my return, the point at which the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>had
best convene, and in the mean time, those who may come on should
not descend the <location_mentioned>Mississippi river</location_mentioned> below the<location_mentioned> mouth of Red river</location_mentioned>, nor
go farther into the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>than <location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Persons wishing to become <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>will forward me to 
<location_mentioned>Herculaneum</location_mentioned>, their names, occupation, number and description of their
<location_mentioned>families </location_mentioned>and the number of <person_mentioned>work hands</person_mentioned> they would employ.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mechanics </person_mentioned>will be particular in describing their trades, and the
number of persons, including <person_mentioned>apprentices</person_mentioned>, attached to their <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="404"/>

<p>A <location_mentioned>port </location_mentioned>having been legally established in the <location_mentioned>Bay of St. Bernard</location_mentioned>,
the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>will at once be secured in a direct communication
with <location_mentioned>New-Orleans</location_mentioned> and other places, from which supplies can be
obtained.</p>

<p>You have already been informed that the Spanish constitution is
in full force in the <location_mentioned>internal provinces</location_mentioned>. And <person_mentioned>Don Erasmo, the 
commissioner appointed to conduct us to the lands</person_mentioned>, brought to <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned>
proclamations, promising security and protection to all persons who
have left the country during former troubles, and who would not
return.</p>

<p>I understand a number have already embraced the offer.</p>

<p>Such parts of my letters as you cause to be published calculated
to give information to the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>, I hope the <location_mentioned>newspapers </location_mentioned>in 
<location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Tennessee</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>will republish.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>P. S. All persons who were <person_mentioned>citizens of <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> at any time
prior to its cession to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>, will find great facilities in
obtaining grants for land in this <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned>.</p>
