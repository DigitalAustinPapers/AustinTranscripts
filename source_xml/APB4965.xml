<p>9 oclock A, M <date_mentioned n="10-19-1835">Oct 19—/35</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. President</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Sir—After having heard you <date_mentioned n="10-19-1835">this morning</date_mentioned> in regard to the arrest of
<person_mentioned>Judge Williams</person_mentioned>, I communicated your Idias and mine to <person_mentioned>Mr Hardin</person_mentioned> on
that subject, it met his full approbation, <person_mentioned>Mr. Hardin</person_mentioned> further observed
to me that he thought it was advisable and necessary to have a <person_mentioned>Mr J M
Smith</person_mentioned> also arrested, His reasons were as follows—<person_mentioned>Mr Smith</person_mentioned> has always
been opposed to the Cause of Freedom, he has when ever in his power,
favored the <person_mentioned>Mexicans</person_mentioned>, to the prejudice of <person_mentioned>Our Citizens</person_mentioned> the has Sir, injured
the Cause of Liberty by Giving all the information possible to <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>,
(that is to those that are now our <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>) He has Sir, when the <person_mentioned>Pirate
Thompson</person_mentioned> was lying in the <location_mentioned>bay of Galveston</location_mentioned>) informed him of all He
knew of the movements and intention of our <person_mentioned>Citizens</person_mentioned>, he has Sir, 
blacken'd the reputation of the <person_mentioned>best Citizens in <location_mentioned>that part of the Contry</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, by 
informing the<person_mentioned> Mexican officers</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Military </person_mentioned>as well as those that belong'd to the
<location_mentioned>Custom House</location_mentioned> of all that was said by them and a great deal more, All
lies of his he has to my knowledge Sir, attempted to take the life of <person_mentioned>Mr
Chs Wilcox</person_mentioned>, for no other reason but only because, he was favorable to our
cause, and took an active part in the affair that took place at <location_mentioned>Anahuac</location_mentioned>,
and was the advocate of Freedom</p><barker_pb n="194"/>

<p>He has influence enough Sir, to injure our cause matirealy. He is 
beside all I have stated to you of his character, a <person_mentioned>murderer </person_mentioned>My reason for
saying so, is that a few days before I left home I was informed that, <person_mentioned>he
and his son</person_mentioned>, have murdered a <person_mentioned>Mr Carroll, (son in law to said Smith)</person_mentioned> the
last accusation is not probably the business of this body—but it is my
opinion that as we had had no <location_mentioned>court </location_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">districk </hi>of Liberty</location_mentioned> since our
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>has been attack'd Therefore I think it is our duty to have him
arrested, not only as a <person_mentioned>murderer</person_mentioned>, but as a <person_mentioned>Traitor </person_mentioned>and an <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>to the
Cause of Liberty</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Peter J. Menard</person_mentioned>, approved of by <person_mentioned>Joseph Bryan</person_mentioned>—Both
from <location_mentioned>Liberty</location_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed]: To The <person_mentioned>President of the Genl Council of Texas</person_mentioned></p>
