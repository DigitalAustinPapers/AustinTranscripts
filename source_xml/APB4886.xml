<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The presant time is both critical, and important. Critical on account of
our disorganized situation; and difficult because our rights are invaded

at this time as one of the happiest events; because they believe you are
capable of managing our difficult affairs better than we could without you.
We wish you to head the preasant expedition against <person_mentioned>General Coss</person_mentioned> in
person believing your presance will be much neaded; to unite the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>,
enforce obedience—, and to plan the movements of the <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Believe me Sir I use no flattery with you but speak what I believe to be
the truth in friendship. We are all alive to the cause of defense in this
part, and will attend to every thing that will promote the cause we are
about to imbark in. We know no <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>here, but are united in the General
cause. The subject of the Consultation will be promptly attended to in
this part.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Eli Mercer</person_mentioned></p>
