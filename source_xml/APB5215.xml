<p><location_mentioned>Columbia, Texas</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="-04-1836">July 4 —1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Major Genl. Edmund P. Gain[e]s</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I arrived here a few days since from the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and find this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>still
threatened with war and its evils. The <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>have commenced active
hostilities on the whole line of the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>along the <location_mentioned>upper or San Antonio
road</location_mentioned>. I am told they are all <person_mentioned>Northern indians</person_mentioned> with rifles, principally 
Harper's ferry, an arm that is not used by the <person_mentioned>native tribes of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>are concentrating their <person_mentioned>forces </person_mentioned>at Matamoras and have no
doubt advanced to the <location_mentioned>river Nueces</location_mentioned> by this time. <person_mentioned>Genl Urrea</person_mentioned> is the 
<person_mentioned>commander-in-chief</person_mentioned>, he has already been joined by <person_mentioned>Genl Cortazar</person_mentioned> with fresh
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>from the <location_mentioned>interior</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The movement of the <person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned> into <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>again, will embolden the
<person_mentioned>indians <location_mentioned>west of the Mississippi</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who no doubt communicate with those to
the <location_mentioned>east of that river</location_mentioned>, and the probability of an <person_mentioned>indian </person_mentioned>war on the <location_mentioned>South
western limits of the U. S.</location_mentioned> appears to be much stronger than it ever was.</p>

<p>I confidently believe that the movement of the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>under your 
command to <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned>will stop an <person_mentioned>indian </person_mentioned>war and preserve the tranquility
of the <location_mentioned>U. S. frontier</location_mentioned>. Such a movement will meet with the approbation of
the <person_mentioned>Govt of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, as you will perceive by the letter of <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned>,
which accompanies this, and I am confident it will receive the most decided
sanction of the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>president of Mexico Genl. Santa Anna</person_mentioned>, who is now a <person_mentioned>prisoner </person_mentioned>in this
place, assures me in the most decided and unequivocal terms of his desire
to end this <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>war on the basis of a recognition of our independence,
and he has written to <person_mentioned>Genl. Jackson</person_mentioned>, requesting the mediation of the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>
Government</person_mentioned> to terminate the war on that basis.</p>

<p>The packet which I herewith send you for <person_mentioned>Genl. Jackson</person_mentioned>, contains <person_mentioned>Genl
Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to him and many other important papers of great 
interest to the public service of <location_mentioned>both countries</location_mentioned>, and I therefore must beg the
favor of you to forward them with the least possible delay, by <person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>, or
in such manner as you may deem expeditious and safe—</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in saying that I believe <person_mentioned>Genl. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> is sincere,
and in good faith, in the promises and offers he has made to this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, to
acknowledge our independence and admit the mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> but he
can do nothing as a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>, or until he returns to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and reassumes
the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, or to the <person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned> and resumes the command, and such is
the state of public opinion here and in our <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>that he can not be 
released until he gives such guarantees, as will satisfy both <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>and the
people of his sincerity. Now the guarantee of <person_mentioned>Genl. Jackson</person_mentioned> will be 
sufficient, and I believe that your guarantee, in conjunction with the establish-<barker_pb n="385"/>
ment of your <location_mentioned>head quarters at Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, would be sufficient— In this
event <person_mentioned>Genl. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> would be liberated— I mean in the event of your
guaranteeing in the name of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> the fulfilment of the treaty made by
<person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> with the <person_mentioned>Govt, of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. The main substance of this treaty is
to remove all the <person_mentioned>Mexican troops</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>beyond the Rio Bravo</location_mentioned> immediately, and
to procure the acknowledgement of the Independence of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>from the
<person_mentioned>Mexican Congress</person_mentioned> and terminate the war by negociation, calling in the
mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> as he has done by his letter to <person_mentioned>Genl. Jackson</person_mentioned> of
this date.</p>

<p>Should your instructions admit of the course indicated without waiting
for an answer to <person_mentioned>Genl Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>President Jackson</person_mentioned>, I am of the
opinion it will lead to an immediate cessation of hostilities and to a 
termination of the war. In the event that you feel authorised to <hi rend="italic">tender </hi>your
friendly interposition in this matter I have no doubt it will be accepted
both by <person_mentioned>Genl Santa Anna</person_mentioned> and by the <person_mentioned>Govt of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—the substance of the
tender being to pave the way for peace and procure the liberation of <person_mentioned>Genl
Santa Anna</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>president of a nation</person_mentioned> that is on the most friendly terms
with the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>, and if you could visit this place in person, for the above
purposes it would have a decisive effect and <person_mentioned>Genl Santa Anna</person_mentioned> would no
doubt be set at liberty, and pave the way through you, for a termination of
all this difficulty.</p>

<p>I make these suggestions as a <person_mentioned>citizen of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— I hold no office, but
can go into the <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>whenever it may be necessary and I have no doubt
the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and people here will approve of the course I have indicated
should it be adopted by you, nor can I doubt that the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> Govt</person_mentioned> will 
approve of it, in as much as the object is to terminate a war upon its <location_mentioned>borders</location_mentioned>
that is viewed by that <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>with great interest, and to promote
and serve the cause of humanity and procure the liberation of the <person_mentioned>President
of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, on terms that will be satisfactory to all <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned>—neither can I
doubt that it will be viewed by <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>in any other light than an act of
friendship towards <person_mentioned>President Santa Anna</person_mentioned>. Delay may be pernicious—the
<person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned> is advancing and if hostilities commence it may be too late
to do anything. The country is turning out <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, and I have no doubt
the <person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned> will be cut to pieces, but the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>are suffering
greatly by being compelled to keep the field, and their good will be 
promoted by a speedy and <hi rend="italic">final </hi>termination of the war.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Genl. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> desires that these matters should not be published in
the <location_mentioned>newspapers </location_mentioned>yet.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
