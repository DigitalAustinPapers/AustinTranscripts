<p>[About February 1, 1821.]</p>
<p>Sir—In compliance to your <person_mentioned>Excellency</person_mentioned>'s orders, I translate and
transmit to you the portions interesting to the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, of a<barker_pb n="381"/>
letter I have received from <person_mentioned>Moses Austin, Agent of the families of
<location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>who come to settle in this <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned>.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>"<date_mentioned n="01-16-1821">January 16th</date_mentioned>.—I met on the <location_mentioned>Sabine River</location_mentioned> two <person_mentioned>Citizens of <location_mentioned>Arkansas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who
told me that through the intervention of <location_mentioned>Russia </location_mentioned>the " <person_mentioned>Cortes </person_mentioned>" have confirmed
the treaty of Peace with the <person_mentioned>U. S.</person_mentioned> that, the <location_mentioned>Sabine </location_mentioned>is the <location_mentioned>boundary </location_mentioned>between
the <location_mentioned>Territories </location_mentioned>of both Governments, that the <person_mentioned>American Congress</person_mentioned> have passed
a Law punishing, with a fine of $1000, emprisonment for one year and 
forfeiture of property, any person who shall trade with the <person_mentioned>Indians in the
<location_mentioned>Spanish Domain</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; that the treaty for exchange of Lands entered into with the
<person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>who lived on the <location_mentioned>Tennessee River</location_mentioned>, on the <location_mentioned>East bank of the Mississippi</location_mentioned>,
for other lands on the <location_mentioned>Head waters of the Arkansas River</location_mentioned>, interferes with a
great many <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>who have to abandon their lands by 
disposition of <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, at the <date_mentioned n="05-31-1821">end of May next</date_mentioned>. They might be very available
if they could [be] allowed to settle in the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, however, there
are also several families concerned, who will neither wait, nor apply for an
authorization, but will settle on their own authority. The <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>ought
to be on its guard against them; they may prove to be dangerous.</p>

<p>"The <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>has sent to the <person_mentioned>Gulf </person_mentioned>two armed Frigates against <person_mentioned>Laffitte</person_mentioned>
and other <person_mentioned>Pirates</person_mentioned>; the so called <person_mentioned>General Long</person_mentioned> is on the <location_mentioned>Continent</location_mentioned>, near 
<location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>; his circumstances are rather bad.</p>

<p>" Trusting that my petition shall be favourably acted upon, I go to <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned>
to prepare the emigration of my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, and others who have applied to remove
to the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>. It would be proper to allow these <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>to 
introduce their property by the <location_mentioned>Colorado River</location_mentioned>, with understanding that they shall
pay such duties as the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>may impose; for myself I ask for 
permission to introduce by that route some agricultural implements and other goods,
for which I offer to pay ordinary duties."</p>
