<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>The call of <person_mentioned>Genl Gains</person_mentioned> on the <person_mentioned>Govr of <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for <person_mentioned>10 companies of
mounted men</person_mentioned> has been met by the <location_mentioned>counties near Frankfort</location_mentioned> the first week
leaving out the rest of the state. The <person_mentioned>Co. from <location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> when complete
sent off to the <person_mentioned>Govr </person_mentioned>at midnight and was the last being the <person_mentioned>10th company
</person_mentioned>offered and the [illegible] night others were in making up to this time <person_mentioned>12
companies</person_mentioned> more than required <person_mentioned>Genl Chambers</person_mentioned> is here and entertains
hopes that several of these <person_mentioned>companies </person_mentioned>will go to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>; the military feeling
of the <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>would be most favorable for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>if your affairs were as they
were <date_mentioned n="Winter-1835">last winter</date_mentioned>, but appearances are so alarming that public feeling<barker_pb n="427"/>
abroad and out of your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is fast approaching a most dangerous point
of giving up all hope and the same state of feeling must arise in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
itself— The removal of <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned></hi>is one among the heaviest blows— The
objections to <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>can not equal the confidence the world has in him,
and the very circumstance of dismissing him proves a want of fitness in
the authorities of the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>which must do the greatest injury— The
attempt to send off <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> by the <person_mentioned>cabinet </person_mentioned>and the desire to kill him
by an other portion of your <person_mentioned>Citizens </person_mentioned>forms an other cause of division
among you and both equally defective as regards policy— The latter has
the addition in public feeling of a violation of all law and principle to
reach an outlaw who was placed on the footing of all other <person_mentioned>prisoners of
war</person_mentioned> the moment his orders to his <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>to retreat was accepted by the
<person_mentioned>Authorities of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— Whether his orders were obeyed or not or whether
so far as they were observed was an advantage to <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></hi>or not matters not
a straw because <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned></hi> can not be blamed and the acceptance of his
proposals was a commencement of negotiations which took his case from
the position he stood in when taken, The world is too ready to consider
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>like all new countries rash and cruel in its measures. The death of
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>St. Anna</person_mentioned></hi> would ruin your <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. Efforts are making in this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>by
the <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>of the unfortunate who fell with <person_mentioned>fanning</person_mentioned>, but public feeling is
against them. <person_mentioned>Fanning </person_mentioned>remains pitied like <person_mentioned>Travis</person_mentioned>, but this can not last
the latter will gain by time but the fame of Poor <person_mentioned>Fannin </person_mentioned>must be lost by
the excessive folly of the manner he conducted when dangers came— he
was brave no doubt—but the way he lost <person_mentioned>600</person_mentioned> of the best force of the 
<location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>and his own useless life will when properly considered leave his name
a Blank this case should be a warning to your <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>the caution of
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned></hi>makes him worth all the untried men in your armies—many men
may Possess equal or even superior talents and still be unfit to command,
the daring spirits of [those] who fight for you if indulged at all times
no hope remains, but by a proper restraint you have nothing to fear— I
do not believe you will ever have a hostile <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>on your soil— the
present attempt may explode in discord at home before the maturity of
the armiment— Still you want all the help you can get to force the treaty
already begun by invassion on your part if found necessary— if you can
Harmonise and avoid offending against Public feeling you are safe— you
owe much to the <hi rend="italic">high </hi>handed black deed of <hi rend="italic">Santa Anna</hi> in creating a 
feeling in your favour and I hope will do nothing to produce a reaction— you
stood on high grounds 3 months ago and it requires all the wisdom of your
best men to preserve the station. <person_mentioned>Genl Chambers</person_mentioned> thinks <person_mentioned>Genl Houston</person_mentioned> is not
displaced but only provisions made untill his wounds are healed— I hope
this is the case— <person_mentioned>Mrs. Holly</person_mentioned>s late addition to the History of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is
highly approved and I should say will find a brisk sale— There is so little<barker_pb n="428"/>
of what we hear entitled to credit from your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>that I should suggest
the plan of some faithful person writing Regularly to the papers in <location_mentioned>N.
Orleans</location_mentioned> all of whom appear to be friendly and supply the most of the news
we receive</p>

<p>The wars under <person_mentioned>Bolivar </person_mentioned>were like yours greatly misrepresented and
sufferd for the want of a regular agent at proper points—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jos Ficklin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Genl Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Texan agent in <location_mentioned>N Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will please put this letter
under cover</p>
