<p><location_mentioned>Navidad</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="08-09-1836">August 9, 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>BRGR. GEN. T. J. RUSK</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir—</p>

<p>I met <person_mentioned>Dr. Archer</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr. Wharton</person_mentioned> at this place— They showed me
your letter to the <person_mentioned>secretary of War</person_mentioned> and instructions to them, as to the 
contemplated movement of the army against <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Archer </person_mentioned>requested
me to return with them so as to combine all our efforts in support of this
measure and I shall do so—</p>

<p>It was my intention to have visited you before this, but hearing that the
<person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>had Made no move from <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>I remained at my <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>brother in
law</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> to obtain a few days rest and recruit my health—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Dr Archer</person_mentioned> and Many others whose opinions I feel bound to respect, 
insisted that I should be a <person_mentioned>candidate </person_mentioned>for <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>at the <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1836">September </date_mentioned>
elections— <person_mentioned>Mr. W. H. Wharton</person_mentioned> was also of the number who requested it.
My name is accordingly before the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>— I have consented to this for
only one reason, which is that I believe I can be of material service in 
procuring the annexation of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> should the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>here wish it,
as I have no doubt they do.</p>

<p>As is usual in such cases, there no doubt are many erronious reports in
circulation—I have heard two— One that I am interested in the land<barker_pb n="413"/>
speculations of <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and others when they were at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>— This
is utterly false—I never have been, am not, and never will be interested in
those speculations, directly nor indirectly, and no one in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is more
opposed to them than I am, and this I say in the nature of a rule of Action,
so far as one can be formed from my knowledge of the subject, for the fact
is that I never have fully understood it, untill within a few days, and I do
not know that I understand it all yet, for these events all took place in my
absence.</p>

<p>The other report is that I have been the means of saving <person_mentioned>General Santa
Anna</person_mentioned>. That man was saved by <person_mentioned>Gen. Sam. Houston</person_mentioned>, as you know better
than I do, and was used by him to procure the Armistice, or arrangement
of <date_mentioned n="04-22-1836">22d. April</date_mentioned> by which I am told orders were issued by <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> to
<person_mentioned>Filisola</person_mentioned>—he was also saved by the <person_mentioned>Cabinet of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> subsequently, and
treaties made with him. I disapprove of all these measures-The first
I think was almost ruinous to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>for it saved the balance of the 
<person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned>, and the other I think was wrong in principle, and more so in
the <hi rend="italic">mode </hi>or <hi rend="italic">manner </hi>of using <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned></p>
<p>If the principle was adopted at all of using <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> for the public
good of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, on the basis of saving his life, the only use that could or
ought to have been made of him in my opinion was with the <person_mentioned>U. S. Govt</person_mentioned>,
and not by an armistice or a treaty— An application from <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>
to that <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, to mediate between <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, on the basis of a 
recognition of the independence of the latter, in all probability would have led
to a correspondence on the subject between the <person_mentioned>U. S. Govt</person_mentioned>, and that of
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>— If <person_mentioned>Santa Anna's friends or party</person_mentioned> had remained in power, they
would no doubt have come to an arrangement through the Mediation of
the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>— If his party had lost their influence, no good would have 
resulted, and we should still have kept <person_mentioned>Santa Anna </person_mentioned>a close prisoner, and all
the bad effects of attempting to liberate him by the treaty with him would
have been avoided— I expressed this opinion to <person_mentioned>Mr Burnet</person_mentioned> and other 
<person_mentioned>members of the Govt</person_mentioned>, and asked whether <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> had written to the <person_mentioned>U. S.
Govt.</person_mentioned>— The answer was that he had not I was at <location_mentioned>Colombia </location_mentioned>a few days
afterwards and saw <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>,—he said much about his desire to procure
the mediation of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>— I told him that no mediation would be 
accepted by <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, except on the basis of a recognition of our independence—
he said that was the basis on which he acted and proposed to write to <person_mentioned>Gen.
Jackson</person_mentioned>— I replyed that he ought to do so, and to state in his letter his
firm and full conviction that <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>could not continue the war with
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>etc—</p>

<p>It is certainly clear that no harm can grow out of this letter, and 
admitting that no good results, as to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, it will evidently do good to
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in public estimation, elsewhere, by showing to the world that the<barker_pb n="414"/>
proud despot of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, acknowledges that the physical force and 
resources of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are Sufficient to sustain herself, and that he has yielded
the point.</p>

<p>As to whether <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> is sincere or not, every one will doubt or 
disbelieve, and justly so, As regards his promises or declarations made to the
<person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, or <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>;—but, very few will believe that he would 
attempt to make -a tool of <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> by telling him lies under his own
signature—The <hi rend="italic">Moral </hi>effect therefore of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. 
Jackson</person_mentioned> must be in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, because it will be considered as a confession
by our principal <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>, that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has the power to sustain herself— I
wrote to <person_mentioned>Gen Jackson</person_mentioned>—my object was to try and get the intervention of
the<location_mentioned> U. S.</location_mentioned> and to have <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>annexed to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>This is all I have done in this matter, and such have been the motives
which influenced me— They are pure and disinterested. I could derive
no benifit, but on the contrary I knew that it would injure me even to see
<person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>— I disregarded that injury because I saw that it was <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>
to do good to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and <hi rend="italic">impossible </hi>to do harm by <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to
<person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned>— If a man who is governed by these kind of motives is to
receive the curses of those he is laboring to serve, then I should say that
purity of intention and disinterestedness have lost their moral influence.
I never did approve of the principle that was adopted as to <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>
when he was first taken I think he merited death, and that the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>
ought not to have been compromised to save him, nor do I approve of the
acts of the <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>in this, and other things, but I would not on that 
account do any thing to overturn our <person_mentioned>civil govt</person_mentioned>. I will always resist such
an attempt so far as I can— As a <person_mentioned>Texian </person_mentioned>I have no sympathies for <person_mentioned>Santa
Anna</person_mentioned>, and every possible cause to hate him. My sympathies are all for
the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and I have labored faithfully to serve them regardless
of myself or popularity as the past and also this <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter proves.
I shall return to <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>and cooperate all I can to carry into effect the
plan of campaign which has been adopted In doing this I shall also be
slandered because it will be used against me by those who are opposed to
the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Matamoras </location_mentioned>expedition</person_mentioned>, and also because it will retard my visit to the
<person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>and the false reports which have been circulated against me will 
remain uncontradicted, except by this letter which I must beg the favor of
you to communicate to Generals <person_mentioned>Green</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>F. Huston</person_mentioned> and to the <person_mentioned>officers</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>so far as you can conveniently—</p>

<p>I am also very anxious to see you, the friendship we formed in time of
my ill health before <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, is I assure you unabated on my part and
strengthened rather than diminished by absence— I feel truly grateful to
you for the services you have rendered <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
