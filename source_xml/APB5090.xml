<p>[R. R. Royall]</p>

<p>Dear Sir: The affairs of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are more entangled than I suspected
they were. While the <person_mentioned>real friends of the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have been laboring in
good faith for the general good of all, a few men, an <person_mentioned>unprincipled party</person_mentioned>,
have clanned together to get possession of the public affairs to promote
their own aims of ambition and personal aggrandizement. There has been
much low intrigue, and amongst others I have been deceived and treated
with bad faith. My whole thoughts and soul were devoted to the common
cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and I could not suffer even my suspicions to descend so low
as to suppose that there were <person_mentioned>individuals </person_mentioned>who could be influenced by any
other motives than purely patriotic ones. I ought to have known better,
but I was unwilling to believe that so much bad faith and political 
dishonesty and low intrigues existed as I am now compelled to believe has
been and no doubt will continue to be practiced by <person_mentioned>Wharton </person_mentioned>and a few
others.</p><barker_pb n="293"/>

<p>What ought the owners of the soil, the <person_mentioned>old settlers of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who have
redeemed this country from the <location_mentioned>wilderness </location_mentioned>and made it what it is, think of
men who will collect the signatures of persons on their first landing, who
had not been here a day, or only a few days in the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, and attempt to
impose a paper thus signed upon the world as the opinion of the <person_mentioned>people of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. This has been done here, and a large number of names collected
to a paper for declaring independence. It is time for the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
to look to their true interest and distinguish between those who serve them
in good faith and those who are mere political jugglers and base <person_mentioned>political
intriguers</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I am associated in a mission to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> with a man that I 
cannot act with—a man whose conduct proves that he is destitute of political
honesty, and whose attention is much more devoted to injure me than to
serve the country. I mean <person_mentioned>Wharton</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Dr. Archer</person_mentioned>, I believe, is governed by
pure intentions, but he is very wild, as I think as to his politics, and too
much inclined to precipitate this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>into more difficulties than there
is any necessiy for. Associated with such men, what have I to expect? or
what has the country to hope? The war is now taken beyond the limits of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. Why bring it back by adopting such a course as must and will turn
all <person_mentioned>parties in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> against us? Will the <person_mentioned>people of this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> suffer
themselves to be jeopardized in this manner by a few men who attempt to
assume their voice?</p>

<p>I have given my opinion on these matters in a letter to the <person_mentioned>Provisional
Government</person_mentioned>, which <person_mentioned>Col. Fannin</person_mentioned> takes up, and to which I refer you. The
fact is that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is now in the hands of a <person_mentioned>party</person_mentioned>, and the whole objects of
this <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>are to retain the power and serve themselves. If they are not
checked they will saddle the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>with an <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>and a debt, and involve
them in a war that will be difficult to bear. The <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>ought to look to
their interest before it is too late. I find that I have but little to expect,
that is if I am to judge of the future by the past few months, and that I
can be of but little use to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I go on this mission from a sense of duty.
It is a bad example for any one to refuse the call of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>when the
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is in difficulty. I have been called to go, and I obey the call; but
if <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>influence and low intrigues and <person_mentioned>cabals </person_mentioned>are to govern <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I wish
to have as little to do with her affairs in future as possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am myself somewhat to blame. My unsuspicious disposition
and the great importance I have always attached to union and harmony,
may have led me into errors by trusting and countenancing men who were
unworthy of my notice or of confidence. When I arrived here <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1835">last 
September</date_mentioned> I found the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>distracted and divided. My first object was to try
and unite and harmonize, and I set the example by harmonizing and acting
with my personal enemies. I did it in good faith and in the firm belief<barker_pb n="294"/>
that I was serving <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by such a course. Had there been good faith in
the men I thus attempted to harmonize, it would have been a service to the
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, but there was not, and for this reason the course I adopted did
harm. I find that <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>must and will exist. I have heretofore tried to
keep them down. I have never been a party man, but in future I believe
the public good will be promoted by having the <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>clearly and 
distinctly marked. Let a line be drawn between them, let the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>
understand that such a line is drawn and judge for themselves. <person_mentioned>Jackson</person_mentioned>'s rule
is a true one: 'everything for <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and nothing for <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>.'</p>

<p>I beg leave to recommend my friend, <person_mentioned>Col. Fannin</person_mentioned>, to you and my <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
generally as a man who is identified with the soil and interests of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
and as an honorable soldier.	Farewell,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
