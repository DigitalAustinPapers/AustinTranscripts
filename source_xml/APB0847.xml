<p><location_mentioned>Woodville [Mississippi]</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="09-02-1824">Sept. 2nd 1824</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr George Huff</person_mentioned>, who is the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned>of this letter to you, is a 
<person_mentioned>BlackSmith </person_mentioned>by trade—and a mecanic of the first order—For the last eight
years he has done, I may say, all my <location_mentioned>plantation </location_mentioned>work in the best
order—He goes to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, at my solicitation, for the purpose of 
viewing the country, and I hope on his arrival there you will have 
judgment enough to induce him, if possible, to move his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>out—And
sir I take the liberty of saying to you that he is the <hi rend="italic">best </hi><person_mentioned>workman </person_mentioned>of
his trade in the <location_mentioned>Western country</location_mentioned>—(I make this expression without
exception) and that is not all, if <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned>, should be pleased with the
country, which I hope he may, and should you hold out to him 
sufficient prospects to induce him, to move his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>out—A <person_mentioned>Mr Joseph
Servison</person_mentioned> of this place will go with him, and be his <person_mentioned>partner</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Mr 
Servison</person_mentioned> can do any thing in wood which relates to Machinery, either
in or out of water—On the Inclined plane or otherwise—You may<barker_pb n="888"/>
rely on me as a <person_mentioned>man or Honor</person_mentioned>, that between those two <person_mentioned>mechanicks</person_mentioned>,
you could have any thing done, in the best order, either in Iron or
wood, which could be done in the <location_mentioned>Western country</location_mentioned>—In a word Sir,
I have been at some trouble to induce <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned>, to visit your 
country, and should he be pleased with it, and move his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, which
I  hope he will do, <person_mentioned>Mr Servison</person_mentioned> will go also, and then you will be
better off for <person_mentioned>mecanicks </person_mentioned>than we will be—Because they are the only
<person_mentioned>Tradesmen </person_mentioned>of their profession, which we have <hi rend="italic">ever had</hi> in this part
of the country worth naming—</p>

<p>And should you hold out sufficient inducements to <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> to move
his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>to that <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, I think that I am authorized to say to
you that him and <person_mentioned>Mr Servison</person_mentioned> will be <person_mentioned>partners </person_mentioned>and be able to 
command funds here, to Erect <location_mentioned>Cotton-Gins</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>Water-Mills</location_mentioned>—and 
Machinery on the principle of the inclined plane and otherwise—</p>

<p>For several years, I have been devoted to your country; but 
having a young <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>; and being well situated here, I have thought
that it would be simple in me to move; but ultimately, I have 
determined to do so—Provided you will authorize me to bring out with
me from Ten to Twenty <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, by way of forming a good <person_mentioned>female-
society</person_mentioned> at once, the only principle on which I can consent to move
my <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>at this time—The <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>who will go with me will be
both wealthy and respectable—Many of them my own relations and
connections.—<person_mentioned>Artizans </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mecanicks </person_mentioned>of the first order, will also
go with me—And should the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>be troublesome, I should like
nothing better than to command against them and settle the 
question with them at once—I served with <person_mentioned>Genl Jackson</person_mentioned> many months
in that service, at his <location_mentioned>head quarters</location_mentioned>.—And if I know any thing it
[is] <person_mentioned>Indian</person_mentioned>-Warfare—<person_mentioned>Col. Child</person_mentioned> is absent on the <location_mentioned>Eastern Circuit</location_mentioned>
and of course can not send his respects to you; but I am authorized
to present [them] to you, which I hope you will except—</p>

<p>I wish you to write me my <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> on the subject of your <location_mentioned>Grant</location_mentioned>
from the <person_mentioned>Mexican-Government</person_mentioned>, etc, its extent and your powers, etc,
—In a word a copy with your remarks to me, would enable me to
facilitate the businiss here—I wish you distinctly to understand, as
we have no personal acquaintance, that any thing, which I have said
to you is to be relied on.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm Johnson</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Honorable Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
