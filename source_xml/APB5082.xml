<p>To <person_mentioned>James F. Perry</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Memorandum as to <person_mentioned>J. B. Austin</person_mentioned>'s estate etc.</p>

<p>All the funds furnished by <person_mentioned>J.B.A</person_mentioned>. when, he entered into <person_mentioned>partnership </person_mentioned>with
<person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned> were furnished by me, and I am now bound for a claim of
upwards of eleven hundred dollars to the <person_mentioned>estate of John Austin</person_mentioned>. In the
settlement <person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned> assumed all the debts due by the <person_mentioned>estate</person_mentioned>. There is
a debt of the firm still unpaid due I think to <person_mentioned>Collins</person_mentioned>. I lost about five 
thousand dollars which I advanced to my <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>in various ways at various
times for that business for after my <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>s death <person_mentioned>John</person_mentioned>'s account against
<person_mentioned>J.B. Austin</person_mentioned> brought him largely in debt. I think about Eleven hundred
dollars which I promised to pay</p>.

<p>The <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>that is deeded to my <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>purchased from <person_mentioned>individuals</person_mentioned>, 
belongs to me, and the deeds were taken in his name because at that time there<barker_pb n="288"/>
was no other <person_mentioned>officer </person_mentioned>to acknowledge them before except me. I wish 
<person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned>s expenses paid out of this <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>after the title is vested in me by the
<person_mentioned>court</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The settlement with the <person_mentioned>estate of John Austin</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>McKinstrie and Austin</person_mentioned>
cannot be made untill <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>returns, and I am present. I do not owe
near the sum claimed.</p>

<p>I know very little about my private affairs. <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>understands them
better than I do. If you can find out anything about them I wish you
to do so. <date_mentioned n="12-18-1835">Dec. 18. 1835</date_mentioned></p>
