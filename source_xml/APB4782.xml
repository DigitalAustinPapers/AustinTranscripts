<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p>I have received your letter of the <date_mentioned n="03-31-1835">31 of March</date_mentioned> with the Bill for $500.
which was paid at sight by <person_mentioned>John P Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for it for I have suffered poverty in public
service.</p>

<p>I regret that you suffer so much embarrassment from my <person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned>.
All that you communicate to me is perfectly concealed from all except
the <person_mentioned>Secretary of State (my brother in Law)</person_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have sent your last letter to <person_mentioned>Mr Forsyth</person_mentioned> for his perusal and he will be
gratified to be possessed of the information it contains— And you may
be assured that he will give you all proper aid.</p>

<p>It is well understood that your whole course has been honorable and
enterprising—and no honorable man can be your enemy when he knows
you.</p>

<p>I will leave no fair means untried to serve you— I have thought 
sometimes, of giving you a call at <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>!</p>

<p>Maintain your accustomed prudence and fortitude and all will soon be
well.</p>

<p>God bless and preserve you.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>H. Meigs</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. Stephen F Austin.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Colonel Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>.</p>
