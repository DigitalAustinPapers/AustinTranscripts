<p><date_mentioned n="11-11-1836">Nov. 11. 1836</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>McKinstre </person_mentioned>has a very likely <person_mentioned>negro </person_mentioned>27 years of age, healthy and a good
<person_mentioned>field hand</person_mentioned>— he has ran away owing to a terrible whipping <person_mentioned>Mc</person_mentioned> gave him
the other day, but I believe has no very bad habits— he asks twelve 
hundred dollars cash— I have an idea of buying him—what do you think of
the price— if I take him will send him to you untill I need him</p>

<p>There are 3 mules here at $100 a piece, I have not seen them, <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>
says they are large and young— I am told there are some Mexican chairs
leather bottom of the kind called Poltrona, to be sold out of the prizes—
I want one of them and one would suit <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>, they are easy chairs to sit
on or sleep in—</p>

<p>There are also some Mexican mats you ought to buy some of them—
they are very good for floors and very neat; quite a nice article, that is
if they are of the kind I mean wove fine with variagated colours. You may
perhaps see some other things that will suit you, and you ought to go to
the sale.</p>

<p>you might perhaps buy or receive in payment of debts Govt, paper—
you will need some to pay Taxes which will be high—</p>

<p>I have bought a pony and send you the mule which you can keep as a
work mule untill I need him— <person_mentioned>Collinsworth </person_mentioned>brings very favorable news
as to our admission into the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> thinks we shall be admitted this winter
if we push this matter I think I shall take a house at <location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>and divide
my time between that and this— I can get no house here for the land
business</p>

<p>My health is improving very slowly</p>

<p>Love to <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>; tell her not to fret about any thing—all is,going well—
There will probably be some <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>cruiser on the <location_mentioned>coast</location_mentioned>, but no invasion— all is revolution in the <location_mentioned>interior of Mexico</location_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> is to
remain for the present</p>

<p>Be very cautious in talking about what I say to you—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. James F. Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach Point</location_mentioned></p>
