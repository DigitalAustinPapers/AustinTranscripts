<p><person_mentioned>Gen. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>When the <person_mentioned>late Convention</person_mentioned> had Organized a <person_mentioned>Provisional Government</person_mentioned>, that
body adjourned to meet again on the <date_mentioned n="03-01-1836">first of March next</date_mentioned>, or sooner if the
<person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Council </person_mentioned>should make a call, leaving the power to the <person_mentioned>Govert</person_mentioned>.
to advise a new election of <person_mentioned>delegates</person_mentioned>, with more <hi rend="italic">ample </hi>powers, than were
delegated by the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>to the <hi rend="italic">late </hi><person_mentioned>Convention</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I am of opinion, that there should be an ordinance, of the <person_mentioned>Provisional
Government</person_mentioned>, for calling a Convention, and upon the plan of equality of
representation, as nearly as possible, making a basis, say of <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, or two
<person_mentioned>members</person_mentioned>, from the <location_mentioned>smaller municipalities</location_mentioned>, and the larger, in ratio of 
population; but in as much, as your knowledge of the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>and its interests,
must excel that of most others among us and your relations of such a 
character, as to render your opinions of great weight, and calculated to 
harmonize popular feeling, in its present unsettled state, I am induced to 
request a full and free expression of your views upon the subject, as the
<person_mentioned>Chairman of the Committee of State</person_mentioned> etc. of the <person_mentioned>General Council</person_mentioned>, that my
<person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>may report an ordinance to the <person_mentioned>Council</person_mentioned>, with all the possible
advantages to the <person_mentioned>public</person_mentioned>, which the nature of the case requires, believing
that this object should be effected with expedition. Your reply is requested
at your earliest leisure—</p>
