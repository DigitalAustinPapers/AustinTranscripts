<p>Sir,</p>

<p>As I shall be absent about three weeks down the river I wish you
to attend to the following instructions relative to new <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The most unequivocal evidence of character must be produced in
the first place, and those who come without any recommendation and
who are unknown in this country must be informed that I gave
<person_mentioned>Garner </person_mentioned>ten lashes for coming here without proper recommendations
and that unless they immediately depart and quit the country they
will be punished. After <person_mentioned>Garner</person_mentioned>'s case I am determined not to receive
any one nor even permit him to remain in the <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>who comes
without proper recommendations, no matter what may be his 
appearance.</p>

<p>Payment must be made down by all new comers in Cash or Cattle
at the rate of one Cow and Calf for a hundred acres of land, and in
the same proportion for Stock Cattle I will also take <person_mentioned>negros</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I wish for as many decent <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>as possible to settle in this place
and all who do so shall have a preference in lots and labors, there
are extensive dead Cane breaks on the oposite side of the <location_mentioned>River</location_mentioned>
where they can make corn easily and on this side there is fine range
for cattle and hogs.</p>

<p>You must examine the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned> emigrants</person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">very closely</hi> and take
care that no bad men get in— <hi rend="italic">let us have noblack sheep in our
flock.</hi></p>

<p>Should a man of notorious bad character come in I hereby fully
authorize you to whip him not exceeding fifty lashes and seize 
sufficient of his property to pay a <person_mentioned>guard </person_mentioned>to conduct him beyond the<barker_pb n="717"/>
<location_mentioned>Trinity River</location_mentioned>—   One example of this kind is wanting badly and
after that we shall not be troubled more.</p>

<p>Send the really good <person_mentioned>emigrants </person_mentioned>to this place they can make corn
early in the Cane opposite here.</p>

<p>Send all the rough <person_mentioned>frontiersmen</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>hunters</person_mentioned>, etc, etc, <location_mentioned>up the river</location_mentioned> or
out on some of the <location_mentioned>creeks</location_mentioned>.</p>
