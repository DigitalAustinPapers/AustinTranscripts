<p>Sir,</p>

<p>In corrisponding with my friends in <location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Ohio</location_mentioned>, I learn
that several of them are desirous of settling in the <location_mentioned>Spanish 
Territory</location_mentioned>:—Knowing that you were forming a settlement in that 
country; I saw no readier way of satisfying their enquires respecting it
than by applying to you for information. In addressing you, Sir,
on this subject I am less influenced by the very slight acquaintance
which happened between us at <location_mentioned>Potosi </location_mentioned>than by the belief that it may
be your interest and wish to communicate inteligence of this kind
to those intending a removal to the <location_mentioned>Spanish province</location_mentioned>. For myself,
having lately received a Medical Diploma from the <location_mentioned>Ohio College</location_mentioned>,
I expect to get my bread by that profession which I expect can be
done as easily in this country, hard as they [times] are, as in the
new and thinly populated <location_mentioned>province of Texas</location_mentioned>. The enquiries of my
<person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>are directed principally to the price and qua[l]ity of land,
the price of produce and live stock, the price of <person_mentioned>mechanic</person_mentioned>s wages
and the climate with regard to health. I have a <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>who is a
<person_mentioned>Millwright </person_mentioned>who with five or six <person_mentioned>farmers </person_mentioned>will remove somewhere to<barker_pb n="460"/>
that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>in the <date_mentioned n="Fall-1822">fall </date_mentioned>if future accounts confirm their present 
expectations.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J. Sargeant</person_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Stephen Austin Esq  </person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>   Near the
<location_mentioned>Mouth of the Colerado</location_mentioned>   via <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>
