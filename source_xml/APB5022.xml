<p><location_mentioned>Head Quarters above Bexar</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-05-1835">Nov. 5, 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>I have heretofore expressed an opinion that it would be doubtfull policy
to grant letters of mark, on more mature reflection I am inclined to change
that opinion— Every effort will be made to distroy us—we are therefore
fully justified in resorting to every possible means of defense.</p>

<p>After the <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>have declared for the Constitution and federal
sistem, and <hi rend="italic">war </hi>against centralism, letters of mark might be granted to
defend our <location_mentioned>coasts </location_mentioned>and cruise against the vessels of the <person_mentioned>centralists </person_mentioned>and 
<person_mentioned>military usurpers</person_mentioned>—under this view I am in favor of it, and recommend the
measure ,</p>

<p>In short we are in a war, in which the objects of our <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>is our <hi rend="italic">total
extermination</hi>. It is a matter of life and death—there is no medium or
middle course left— none at all—under these circumstances there must be<barker_pb n="240"/>
no half way measures on our side—no hesitation or scruples— The basis of
the Constitution is just, and to defend that Constitution and ourselves, we
are fully justifiable in calling in all the aid of <hi rend="italic">every description</hi>, we can get.</p>

<p>I again recommend the immediate organization of a <person_mentioned>civil Govt</person_mentioned>, and the
appointment of a <person_mentioned>Govr</person_mentioned>. or <person_mentioned>civil head</person_mentioned>— Also the organization of a <person_mentioned>regular
army</person_mentioned>, with a <person_mentioned>Genl</person_mentioned>. of well known military talents experience, integrity and
moral influence. This is very important.</p>

<p>With regard to certain <person_mentioned>individuals </person_mentioned>about whom I have been written to—
I beg leave to say that the <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>is the only competent authority to
decide whether they are <person_mentioned>enemies to our country</person_mentioned> and cause or not— I would
on this subject respectfully recommend moderation and prudence— The
<person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>is in good spirits—the three cannon have arrived and 
<person_mentioned>reenforcements </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>180 men</person_mentioned>— I must however say that the taking of <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>is very
difficult— My health for the last two weeks has been so bad that I have
been unable to attend actively in person to the duties of my station— they
would be truly arduous to the most experienced man, considering the nature
of a <person_mentioned>militia </person_mentioned>force, where there is no law but moral principle and 
enthusiasm to keep them together, but they' are doubly so to me with a 
debilitated constitution and bad health, added to a want of experience in Military
operations—I trust however that the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>will be satisfied with the efforts
and the movements of the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>so far.</p>

<p>We have in every instance driven the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>within his <location_mentioned>fortifications</location_mentioned>
which are very strong and have gained many signal advantages.</p>

<p>Nothing will aid <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>so much as an <person_mentioned>expedition from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
against <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>under <person_mentioned>Genl Mexia</person_mentioned>— It is <hi rend="italic">all </hi>important— I recommend
that every possible effort be made to fit out such an <person_mentioned>expedition </person_mentioned>if it has not
already been done, as I hope it has been</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>If <location_mentioned>matamoros </location_mentioned>is attacked and revolutionized by <person_mentioned>Mexia</person_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>would fall
as a matter of course, for all supplies of funds or <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>would be cut off.
There is no way in which funds or <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>could be employed to so much
advantage to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>as in an <person_mentioned>expedition </person_mentioned>against <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned></p>

<p>This enterprise merits the first attention of the convention an <person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>, at
any expense should be sent to the <person_mentioned>committee of <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> urging this
<person_mentioned>expedition</person_mentioned>, also to<location_mentioned> N. York</location_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Zavala </person_mentioned>ought to write to <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> on the 
subject—even a <hi rend="italic">rumor </hi>of such a thing would keep <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>from being sent
to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The military operations will be pressed now very rapidly, as much so
as practicable— The convention however must not be surprised should
<location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>hold out for a long time— It has been unanimously decided in a
<person_mentioned>council of war</person_mentioned> with one exception, that it ought not to be stormed— they
have plenty of provisions inside— The corn and country around <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned><barker_pb n="241"/>
might be laid waste, it is true and [unreadable] <location_mentioned>Guadalupe </location_mentioned>but this will
ruin the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>who are our <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>The grass will all be burnt <location_mentioned>from
Rio Grande to Bexar</location_mentioned>— I shall send <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>for this purpose but the other
measures of laying waste the <location_mentioned>country round Bexar</location_mentioned>, I think too hard on the
<person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>By <person_mentioned>Express </person_mentioned>very important to be sent without delay</p>

<p>To the <person_mentioned>President of the General Consultation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>wherever it is in
session</location_mentioned></p>

<p>In the name of Almighty God send no more ardent spirits to this <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned>—
if any is on the road turn it back, or have the head knocked out—</p>
