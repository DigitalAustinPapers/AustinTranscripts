<date_mentioned n="05-14-1823">tomorrow evening</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Durango </location_mentioned>therefore if you write me from <location_mentioned>Monty</location_mentioned>-
you may direct your letter to that place from which I will also write
you on my arival—In the inclosed you will see my intentions, which
however, may change with a change of circumstances but if I should
not find it extremely necessary to take a trip by sea in the <date_mentioned n="Fall-1823">fall </date_mentioned>for
my health and can possibly obtain the necessary capital, I shall
prefer my establishment in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to all others, as being that which
whilst best calculated to procure me a comfortable living may tend
to promote your designs and interest in the colonization of your
district, and place me in a situation to give you some proofs of my
gratitude for your friendly disposition, as respects the surveying if
the <person_mentioned>Baron de Bastrop</person_mentioned> will give me a liberal part, (if all is under
his controle) I will take upon myself all the active operations of that
office, which I will execute in the nicest manner leaving to him the
recording alone and in order to be eligible I will apply to <person_mentioned>congress</person_mentioned>
for a letter of citizenship, under the pretext of erecting machinery,
promoting agriculture and manufacturies—I wish you to say frankly
in your letter if you think a <person_mentioned>tribe of these sodomites</person_mentioned> will be of
service or injury to your <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>for this must always be in the<barker_pb n="643"/>
bargain, if they go they must be allowed to steel a little so as not
to get out of practice</p>
