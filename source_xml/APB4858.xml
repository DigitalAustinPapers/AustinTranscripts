<p>I received yours dated the <date_mentioned n="08-14-1835">14th of August 1835</date_mentioned> I have been wating
with a great deal of patience, to hear from you. I had given it out, from
ever hearing from you again but to my great surpise, I received a letter
from you, I have been as I concieved it negligent, for not writing you
sooner but I beg to be excused, I have been busy doing some little
business for the <person_mentioned>political chief</person_mentioned> and attending to other affairs that it was
almost impossible for me to write you, I am in great hopes you will be
more regular in writing to me, than you have been heretofore, and I will
do the same, our <location_mentioned>village </location_mentioned>has been and is yet in such a state of confusion,
that I scarcely once thought of you a few of the <person_mentioned>individuals of <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>have come to this place and held their meeting. It was termed by several
in fact numbers that it was a <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>meeting, and not a <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>
meeting there were some three or four that attended it, the rest stood
off and gazed on but said nothing. the principal part of the<person_mentioned> people of <location_mentioned>San
Felipe</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are opposed to a convention or any thing resembling it after the
meeting was adjourned there were some 10 or 12 perhaps more talking
about politicks, and amongst the rest <person_mentioned>Wharton </person_mentioned>spoke very precipitate about
<person_mentioned>Capt Bird</person_mentioned> although they were perfect <person_mentioned>strangers </person_mentioned>to each other, our <person_mentioned>Capt</person_mentioned>
heard him then there were some words passed and <person_mentioned>Bird </person_mentioned>went immediately
and got his rifle, and came back, and wated for a chance to single him
from the rest to kill him, but was prevented by some of his <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Bird</person_mentioned>
told him he had him in his power and could use him up if he saw proper.
