<p>To <person_mentioned>Amos Edwards of <location_mentioned>Russellsville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for which my due Bill is given</p>

<p>												    ___________</p>
<p>												   $227. 33 1/3</p>

<p>When I purchaced the waggon I gave my note to <person_mentioned>Doct B. Roberts
</person_mentioned>for Five Hundred Dollars payable in Six Months after date and
at the same time made a written contract with <person_mentioned>Messrs Geo. W.
and W. H. Whitakers of <location_mentioned>Russellville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for Five thousand pounds of
<hi rend="italic">Small Bar Lead</hi> to be deliver'd at <location_mentioned>Clarksville </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>by
the <date_mentioned n="05-01-1815">1st day of May.</date_mentioned> at Ten Dollars pr Hundred, payable on the
same day that my Note to <person_mentioned>Doct Roberts</person_mentioned> becomes [due] I also was
to deliver him at the same time Six Hundred pounds of Shot. (See
the Memorandum in the contract for the numbers) at 15$ pr Cwt
to pay for Sundry articles I got principaly for <person_mentioned>Mr Brickey</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I also promised (verbally) that I would Send on 100 pounds of
Shot <hi rend="italic">assorted to <person_mentioned>Col. Bailor</person_mentioned></hi> near <location_mentioned>Russellsville </location_mentioned>for which he was to
pay the market price It would be best to get <person_mentioned>Mr J. Ficklin</person_mentioned> to 
attend to this business and take up my notes from <person_mentioned>Roberts </person_mentioned>and 
contract from the <person_mentioned>Whitakers </person_mentioned>after the Lead and Shot is delivered.
Since Lead has fallen if the 5000 is not delivered by the day it is
more than probable it will not be recd- so that Lead that is [on
hand?] ought to be [made?] into pound Bars and appropriated to
this use, My Credit stands very fair now at <location_mentioned>Russelsville </location_mentioned>and if this
Contract is complied with it will continue to stand high which may
be of much use to me hereafter it therefore is of great importance to
me as well as yourself that the Lead should be sent on in time This
I believe is all the unsettled business I have in <location_mentioned>Ky</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>At <location_mentioned>Herculanium </location_mentioned>I purchased 200 Baskets of Corn from <person_mentioned>Doct.
Cairns</person_mentioned> at 37 1/2 cents payable the <date_mentioned n="06-01-1815">first of June </date_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Horine </person_mentioned>I am 
fearful will not deliver much more meal untill he is paid for what we
have got</p>

<p>I subscribed <location_mentioned>5 Lots</location_mentioned> and 100 Dolrs for the <location_mentioned>Hercun Bridge</location_mentioned> in your
name subject to your confirmation.</p>

<p>I this day purchase 101 yards of Linnen from <person_mentioned>C Patterson</person_mentioned> at 40.
cts. for which I gave a due Bill in your name payable the <date_mentioned n="05-15-1815">fifteenth
day of May</date_mentioned></p>

<p><date_mentioned n="03-25-1815">March 25th 1815</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen F Austin </person_mentioned>  [Rubric]</p><barker_pb n="252"/>

<p><person_mentioned>M Austin Esq</person_mentioned></p>

<p>You had better write to <person_mentioned>Henry Elliott</person_mentioned> to try to engage Freight to
<location_mentioned>Clarksville </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>for the 5000 of Lead and Shot and also to
