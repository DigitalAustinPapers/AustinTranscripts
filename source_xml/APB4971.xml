<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Bearer </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Sidney S Callender</person_mentioned> is one of the Young men who have
volunteered to aid the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in defending their rights—He is a<barker_pb n="197"/>
practical <person_mentioned>printer </person_mentioned>and was for sometime <person_mentioned>Editor of the Lafayette Gazette</person_mentioned>—
Sympathizing in your Cause he has determined to make <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>his <location_mentioned>adopted
Country</location_mentioned> and to fight in her defence—There exists in, this place in favour
of your cause a Similer feeling, which will, be encreased and rendered
more effective, when the determination of your Convention to maintain
unimpaired the Constiutional right of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, or to establish an 
<person_mentioned>independent Government</person_mentioned> is made known such measure will inspire your
<person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>with confidence, and you can obtain not only men but money—</p>

<p>The many hardships suffered by the <person_mentioned>early settlers of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and their
patience and forbearance under privations, You as well as myself have
fully experienced, and I trust that in the hour of trial they will exhibit the
same determined character, that they will be united and rather perish to a
man than renounce a <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>so dearly earned—As for myself I have
nothing to offer, but my personal services which I freely tender in any
manner or shape, either here or there—my attachment for <location_mentioned>texas </location_mentioned>and her
<person_mentioned>first settlers</person_mentioned> is unimpaired—I would peril my life in her defence—Should
the war be [prolonged] (which can only be in case <person_mentioned>St Anna</person_mentioned> continues in
power) you will need the assistance of this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>—In such event <person_mentioned>Agents</person_mentioned>
Authorised by your <person_mentioned>provisional Government</person_mentioned> can do good Service in 
procuring <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>etc—</p>

<p>[I] pray the favor of a letter from you, and an authority to remit <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>
for your service—God prosper the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—</p>
