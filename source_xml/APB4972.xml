<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-21-1835">21 October 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My Dear Sir—</p>

<p>I have lately written you two letters merely informing you of what has
been passing here, in regard to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>since you left this <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>— The news
of your long (by me) expected war movement reached this <location_mentioned>city </location_mentioned>on the
<date_mentioned n="10-12-1835">12th Inst</date_mentioned> and I immy called a public meeting of our <person_mentioned>citizens </person_mentioned>at the <location_mentioned>Bank
Arcade</location_mentioned> for the Evening of the <date_mentioned n="10-13-1835">13th</date_mentioned> you may judge of the prepared 
[profound] excitement of the Public Mind, when I assure you the meeting was
the largest ever known in <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>—and by acclamation we passed
the resolutions you will find inclosed— So great was the <person_mentioned>crowd </person_mentioned>that the
large Room would not hold them and we had to retire to another— we
<date_mentioned n="10-20-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>sent off two <person_mentioned>divisions of about <person_mentioned>60 men</person_mentioned> each</person_mentioned>, one by way of the
<location_mentioned>River </location_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Nagatodges</location_mentioned>-the other by the <location_mentioned>Sc Columbus</location_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>Brassoria</location_mentioned>, well<barker_pb n="198"/>
armed and equipped with cannon, guns, powder, Balls, Lead—Saddles
Bridles etc. etc. and in a few days we will dispatch the Sc. Louisiana with
a <person_mentioned>third Division</person_mentioned>—those gone, are all fine looking <person_mentioned>young men</person_mentioned>—genteel in
appearance, and I have no doubt will do honor to themselves—many of
them have left respectable situations of $1200 to $1500 a year in 
<location_mentioned>Counting houses</location_mentioned> here—besides—The <person_mentioned>Creoles of the <location_mentioned>Lower Fauburg</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> not to be
outdone by us, have I am trully informed raised a <person_mentioned>corps of 150 men</person_mentioned> at
their expense—who will depart immy— Thus you see my Dear Sir—your
cause must and will succeed, because all feel you are in the Right— There
are men engaged in your cause here, who by their power, wealth and 
influence can do almost anything— The excitement is still at its height—
hundreds of applications are daily making to join the Rank— but we allow
only those <hi rend="italic">we </hi>choose to muster in them.—</p>

<p>This movement of ours here will be followed by similar ones thru' the
<location_mentioned>whole valley of the Mississippi</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>Natches </location_mentioned>is up already—from <location_mentioned>N. York
</location_mentioned><location_mentioned>Bostn </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Philada</location_mentioned>- also means will come to us—and the only fears I 
entertain are—in the first place that more will be received than required—.
and that from the <location_mentioned>upper Country</location_mentioned> a population may be entered among you,
that will be of little use afterwards—however the Crisis is alarming and
for the sake of health we must take the Bitter with the Sweet—</p>

<p>It is with feelings of indescribable emotion, that all here, wait with 
intense anxiety for news from your <location_mentioned>Quarter</location_mentioned>— What have the division that
went after <person_mentioned>Coss </person_mentioned>done? Where is <person_mentioned>Col. Austin</person_mentioned>? Have they declared a
<person_mentioned>provisional Govt</person_mentioned> adhering to the Constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>???— Upon this
last act— <hi rend="italic">"hangs all the Law and the Prophets"</hi> <person_mentioned>Coss </person_mentioned>must be checked—
The <location_mentioned>state of Zacatecas</location_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>more than one half the people of the <location_mentioned>Mexican
Republic</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—only await one conquering cry to flash out, to rally with 
redoubled energy—then the Fate of the Tyrant is inevitable—and your 
country I hope, placed upon a different and more permanent basis of True
Liberty than it has ever yet enjoyed—then how Glorious for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—what
a spectacle for the world to behold—</p>

<p>as for myself my dear sir—I have the same opinions now I expressed to
you here—a thousand times a day I am asked are you going?— When
do you go?— my answer is this I await further intelligence from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—
I wait to hear of the formation of a <person_mentioned>Provl. Govt</person_mentioned>-—and if that body require
me—I am in a moment ready—mean time I can do some good to the great
cause here—but sir if that <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. should appoint me, I will instantly obey
the call—</p>

<p>above all things, keep the <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>here (whose names are inclosed)
in constant information of all your movements, even by <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>if 
necessary—I will keep you constantly informd by every oppy- of what is going
on in this <location_mentioned>Quarter</location_mentioned>— do you the same by us relative to yours—in a moment.<barker_pb n="199"/>
like this— I have but little time to write, the <person_mentioned>Divisions </person_mentioned>sail as soon as this
letter is closed—therefore no more—but—Victory and Liberty for Ever</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jas Ramage </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. Stephen Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p>N. B. I had forgot to mention You will see in the inclosed paper
that <person_mentioned>Genl. Mehia</person_mentioned>, a man named <person_mentioned>Fisher </person_mentioned>and others were at the meeting—
we have our doubts— These expeditions are solely, purely, simply <person_mentioned>American </person_mentioned>in all their parts—</p>
