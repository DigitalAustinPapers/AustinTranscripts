	<barker_summary>Project of a constitution for the Republic of Mexico.</barker_summary>
	<barker_footnotes>Besides this somewhat complete draft of a Constitution, there are a Spanish 
translation of the general provisions, Articles 1-29, and another, apparently earlier, form of
Articles 110-225. Austin has preserved the order of the Spanish Constitution of 1812
and as much of its substance as could be adapted to the republican form of government.
The Constitution of the United States was, of course, his model for most of the 
variations and adaptations from the Spanish document. As yet no attempt has been made to
determine what, if any, influence Austin may have had on the Mexican Constitution; but
see below, May —, 1823, "Copy of a Plan," etc.
In a marginal note Austin says of Articles 141-145, "Those marked X are omitted
in the copy" — meaning, perhaps, a copy that he gave to some member of the Constituent
Congress.</barker_footnotes>

<p><location_mentioned>City of Mexico</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="03-29-1823">March 29, 1823</date_mentioned></p>
<p>We, the <person_mentioned>People of the <location_mentioned>Mexican Nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, having assumed those
natural and imprescriptable rights which appertain to us as members
of the great human family, an[d] in virtue thereof declared 
ourselves an independent nation, free from the dominion of old <location_mentioned>Spain</location_mentioned>
and all other powers whatever; and being desirous of establishing
and consolidating a system of Government founded on the solid basis
of Natural justice, equal rights, and common good, in order to
insure union, strength, safety, harmony, equity, and the blessings
of liberty to ourselves and posterity; do ordain, decree, and 
establish, this Constitution, for the <person_mentioned>Government of the <location_mentioned>Mexican Nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Chapter I</p>

<p>CONSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDAMENTAL MAXIMS</p>

<p>Article 1. The <person_mentioned>People of the <location_mentioned>Mexican Nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are independent of
<location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>and all other powers whatever, and have the sole, absolute,
and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, Sovereign, and
independent Nation.</p>

<p>Article 2. All men as individuals, have certain natural, essential
and inherent rights; among which are the enjoying and defending
life and liberty, acquiring possessing and protecting property, and
in a word of seeking and obtaining happiness.</p>

<p>Art. 3. When men enter into a State of Society they surrender
up some of their natural rights to that Society, in order to insure the
protection of others; and without such an equivalent the surrender
is void.</p><barker_pb n="602"/>

<p>Art. 4. The surrender of these rights must also be free, voluntary,
and without coertion, or it is void.</p>

<p>Art. 5 The rights thus surrendered are deposited in the hands of
the agents of the People, to be exercised for the common good, 
common security, and General happiness of all.</p>

<p>Art. 6 These agents constitute, and administer the national 
Government.</p>

<p>Art. 7 The sovereignty resides essentially and originally in the
<person_mentioned>People</person_mentioned>, and from its nature is unalienable, imprescriptable, and 
indivisible ; the national agents are therefore at all times accountable to
the <person_mentioned>People</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Art. 8 Government being instituted for the common benefit, 
protection and happiness of the whole community, and not for the
private interest, or agrandisement of any one man, family or class
of men; therefore whenever its objects are perverted, or public 
liberty manifestly endangered and all other means of redress are 
ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or
establish a new Government. The doctrine of non-resistance to
arbitrary power is absurd, degrading, and distructive of the 
happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>Art. 9 The people have a right to assemble in an orderly and
peacible manner, to consult upon the public weal, give instructions
to their deputies and petition <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>for redress of grievances.</p>

<p>Art. 10 A well regulated <person_mentioned>national Militia</person_mentioned> is the proper, and
natural defence of a <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>, and no <person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>shall be deprived of the
right of keeping and carrying arms; except in such cases, to be 
specially provided for by law, in which the public tranquility may render
it necessary.</p>

<p>Art. 11 All elections ought to be free, and every <person_mentioned>inhabitant of the
<location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, having the qualifications required by law, has an equal right
to elect and be elected into office.</p>

<p>Art. 12 Every <person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>is entitled to a certain remidy, by having
recourse to the laws for all injuries he may receive in his person,
property or character; to obtain right and justice freely, without
being obliged to purchase it, and promptly according to the laws.</p>

<p>Art. 13 Every person hath a right to be secure from unreasonable
searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and 
possessions, none of which shall be molested except in the cases and
with the formalities prescribed by law.</p>

<p>Art. 14 No part of a mans property shall be taken and applied
to public use except by his own consent, or by virtue of a law 
regularly enacted by <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, and no duty, or contribution of any
description shall be levied or collected without due authority by law
of <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="603"/>

<p>Art. 15 The liberty of the Press and of Speech is so essential to
the freedom and improvement of the nation, that it shall be 
inviolably preserved, and can only be restricted by <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>so as to
prevent scandalous attacks on private character.</p>

<p>Art. 16 <hi rend="italic">Ex post facto</hi>, or retrospective laws are oppressive and
unjust, and no such law shall be passed</p>

<p>Art. 17 In all cases and at all times the <person_mentioned>Military </person_mentioned>ought and shall
be under strict subordination to the civil power, except in the cases
to be provided for by law in time of war, or invasion</p>

<p>Art. 18 No <person_mentioned>soldier </person_mentioned>in time of peace shall be quartered in any house
or hacienda without the consent of the owner, and in time of war such
quarters ought to be made in the manner to be prescribed by law</p>.

<p>Art. 19 No person shall be subject to Martial law except those 
employed in the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>navy</person_mentioned>, or in the <person_mentioned>Militia </person_mentioned>in actual Service.</p>

<p>Art. 20 The basis of the national representation is the population
including all native free born citizens of whatever descent, wheither
<person_mentioned>American</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>European </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>african</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>who are considered
as <person_mentioned>Citizens</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Art. 21 Monopolies, and exclusive and special previliges, wheither
in favour of an individual, or an association, of <person_mentioned>eclesiastics </person_mentioned>or 
<person_mentioned>laymen</person_mentioned>, are prejudicial to the true interests of the nation contrary to
natural justice, and are absolutely prohibited; except when granted
according to the formalities of the law, for a limited period, as a
compensation for new inventions and improvements in the arts or
sciences.</p>

<p>Art. 22 No hereditary office, honors, titles of nobility, or any other
titles except those of office shall be granted.</p>

<p>Art. 23 No public money shall be drawn from the treasury or in
any manner appropriated except by virtue of a law of <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>; and
the <person_mentioned>President of Mexico</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Minister </person_mentioned>or any other person who violates
this article shall be guilty of a high crime and punished according to
law.</p>

<p>Art. 24 The power of suspending the laws or the execution of them
shall alone be exercised by <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Art. 25 The entail of estates by primogeniture to the exclusion of
younger children (<person_mentioned>Mayorasgos</person_mentioned>) is calculated, arbitrarily to prevent
the distribution of property, thereby, in violation of justice 
enriching the few, and empoverishing the many, to create and 
perpetuate <person_mentioned>aristocracy</person_mentioned>, and to engender indolence, arrogance, vice, and
corruption, and is therefore distructive of individual happiness, 
subversive of national prosperity, at variance with the principles of a
free Government, and dangerous to the liberties of the people; all
such entails shall therefore be distroyed, and an equitable system of<barker_pb n="604"/>
inheritance established by law, founded on the basis of equal justice
and national prosperity.</p>

<p>Art. 26 Despotic Governments have endeavored to keep the minds
of the people in darkness by prohibiting the introduction of books
proscribed for their liberal principles. Free Governments on the
contrary have thrown open the door for the admission of all without
exception, and experience has fully proved the beneficial effects of
this liberal policy in enlightening the people, who, very soon 
discriminate between any evil, irreligious, or immoral doctrines which such
books may contain, and the pure and virtuous ones; rejecting the
former, and profiting by the latter. All restrictions or prohibitions
therefore on the introduction, sale or reading of books, are calculated
to prevent the diffusion of intellectual light, and knowledge; to retard
the improvement of the Nation, by perpetuating ignorance, 
superstition and servile principles, and are at variance with the genius of
free institutions, and shall never be imposed under any pretext 
whatever.</p>

<p>Art. 27 A nation can only be free, happy and great in proportion
to the virtue and intelligence of the people; the dessimination of
usefull knowledge and of the arts and sciences is therefore of 
primary importance to national liberty and prosperity, and to effect
this great object, it shall be the duty of <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>to provide by every
means in their power for the speedy establishment of <location_mentioned>schools</location_mentioned>, 
<location_mentioned>academies </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>colleges </location_mentioned>throughout the whole nation for the instruction of
youth and <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Art. 28 In order to prevent those who are invested with authority
from becoming oppresors; the people have a right, at such tinier
and in such manner as they shall establish by the frame of 
Government, to cause their public officers to return to private life, and to
fill up vacant places by regular elections and appointments.</p>

<p>Art. 29 A frequent recurrence to the fundamental principles of
the Constitution; a rigid obedience to the laws; and a strict 
adherance to justice, temperance, industry, frugality and all the social and
civil virtues is necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty and
good Government.</p>
