<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I am now here endeavoring to arra[n]ge my <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>s business and
my own so as to leave this country—Orders have been lately recd
at the <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Surveyor</person_mentioned>s office</location_mentioned> to prepare the <location_mentioned>Red River property</location_mentioned> for market
as soon as possible, and in consequence <location_mentioned>New Madrid claims</location_mentioned> have risen
very much—<person_mentioned>Langham and a Company</person_mentioned> are purchaseing them up to
locate on <location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned> and offer as high as 12.$ an <location_mentioned>arpent </location_mentioned>on a credit—
I think I can get a small claim for <hi rend="italic">5$ Cash</hi> and I have determined
to sell all your Flour and buy a <location_mentioned>Madrid claim</location_mentioned> with the money, and
not send down the Boat at all—I should have done so if the property
had been my own and very well know that it will be more to your
advantage to sell the f [lour] here at 8$ and buy a claim at 5$ than
to get 30$ a Barrel for it and loose the opportunity of geting a claim
even at any price—I value my improvement in the <location_mentioned>Long Praire</location_mentioned> at
100$ pr acre for it will yeald an interest, on the money (calculating
the land at 100$ pr acre) of at least 25 pr. cent and pay the expence
of working it besides—I shall therefore sell the Flour get a claim and
locate it for our joint benefit on my improvement in the <location_mentioned>Long Praire</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I can not tell when I shall leave here—My <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>s business is all
in confusion—I advise you to return as soon as possible by Land<barker_pb n="331"/>
and bring all the money you can with you and buy <location_mentioned>Madrid claims</location_mentioned>,
and take memorandum to locate them—you may depend that <location_mentioned>choice
Land</location_mentioned> will sell for not less than 50$ at the publick sales on <location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>James Cox</person_mentioned> appears to be very much dissatisfied about his fay 
particularly for the rent of his Plattin places, and intimates that he will
attach your <location_mentioned>Property in Orleans</location_mentioned>. I give you this information to put
you on your guard</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I think you had better send the goods that are yet unsold to the
<location_mentioned>Long Praire</location_mentioned>, a small <location_mentioned>Store </location_mentioned>will do very well there</p>

<p>I Recd. your Letters from <location_mentioned>White and Arkansas Rivers</location_mentioned>, in the last
one you request me (to?) buy <location_mentioned>Madrid claims</location_mentioned> out of Funds to be
furnished by <person_mentioned>J. Austin</person_mentioned>. I think that you ought to hurry back as soon
as you can, for <person_mentioned>J. Austin</person_mentioned> is a poor hand to collect or attend to 
business— <person_mentioned>Brickey </person_mentioned>will attend to collections for one month, after which
he wishes his own time.</p>
