<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="09-21-1835">Sept. 21st. 1835.</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Gentlemen</person_mentioned>—</p>
<p>I received the information last night of the <person_mentioned>expedition </person_mentioned>that is raising to
march on to <location_mentioned>Labacca </location_mentioned>and without delay have sent <person_mentioned>expresses </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Harrisburg</location_mentioned>,
<location_mentioned>Trinity </location_mentioned>and the <location_mentioned>upper country</location_mentioned> with copies of the paper which I enclose for
your information— <person_mentioned>Frank Johnson</person_mentioned> starts <date_mentioned n="09-22-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>for <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>; I
have requested them in that <location_mentioned>quarter </location_mentioned>to raise all the men they can and march
on without delay. There must now be no half way measures— War in
full— The sword is drawn and the scabbard must be put on one side
until the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>are all driven out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I presume you have received
the <location_mentioned>circular </location_mentioned>from the <person_mentioned>committee of this place</person_mentioned> dated the <date_mentioned n="09-19-1835">19th inst</date_mentioned>.; <person_mentioned>Mr. 
Brigham</person_mentioned> took it down— it was written in consequence of information received
from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>which was of so decisive a character that the <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>deemed
it a duty to take a clear and [un]equivocal position at once and to let the
<person_mentioned>country </person_mentioned>know its opinion— I am happy to say that in <location_mentioned>this quarter </location_mentioned>and in
the <location_mentioned>upper country</location_mentioned> so far as I have heard, all are united and all for <hi rend="italic">War</hi>;
I hope you will inform me of what is done so that there may be as much
concert as possible, you will see by the enclosed paper, that a <person_mentioned>corps of
reserve</person_mentioned> is proposed. This was done because I expect, that some will come
on from <location_mentioned>Trinity </location_mentioned>and some from <location_mentioned>Bevil' settlement</location_mentioned> who cannot be in time for
the advance, and it was necessary to give them some center to report to, so
as to receive direction and organization; until there is some <hi rend="italic">head </hi>to order;
we must all try to labour in concert, so as to support each others movements
as much as the distance and circumstances will permit. I will remain here
for a while, or go on to <location_mentioned>Labacca </location_mentioned>as may be deemed most advisable. I seek
no command and wish none, but am ready to do all the good I can to
unite opinions and raise <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>, and to fight in person— I go into this war
cheerfully and with very different feelings from what I had in any of our
past difficulties— we are now <hi rend="italic">right </hi>our basis is sound and just, and will<barker_pb n="131"/>
be so declared by an impartial world; we are defending our constitutional
rights against <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>usurpation—</p>

<p>I hope you will communicate your opinions to me fully and frankly.</p>
<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin.</person_mentioned></p>
<p>To the <person_mentioned>Committee of Safety &c. of <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>
