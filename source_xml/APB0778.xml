<p>I regret much to say to you that we have had no rain since your
departure from here, which has so much discouraged the <person_mentioned>Colonists</person_mentioned>,
that several of them think of leaving the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>and some have
already made their preparations to go back, which may cause a
serious injury to this <location_mentioned>Province </location_mentioned>[by checking?] an increase of 
population, and improvements. But I am of the opinion that they would
all remain if they had in their hands titles for their lands, for this
reason, I have sent <person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned> to wait upon you on your way to
the <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, and to have done at once with that business. Some
more <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>have arrived, nearly the <person_mentioned>300 </person_mentioned>are here and the others are
on their way; so we may complete the whole proceedings in a very
short time. Therefore, I request you to be pleased to come with
<person_mentioned>John</person_mentioned>, or to send the <person_mentioned>Commissioner Baron de Bastrop</person_mentioned>, for the 
purpose of having done entirely with this business.</p>
