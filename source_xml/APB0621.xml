<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I recd yours of the <date_mentioned n="07-09-1823">9th July</date_mentioned>, and am sorry to hear that things are
not so flourishing as we all had desired, I would willingly add my
assistance, but at this time I find it impossible without doing myself
more harm than I could possibly do the <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>good I have now
determined to make a trip to <location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>in order to bring on medicines,
in which I shall need your friendship, I shall leave here with about
400 dollars which is about enough for my expenses, and depend 
entirely on a partnership or credit business in <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, in which case a
few lines from your hand to <person_mentioned>Mr. J. H. Hawkins</person_mentioned> would be of infinite
service, which you will probabily have an opportunity to send him
before I can arrive there—my whole object is <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but finding it
impossible to rais capital on credit for the enterprise I must make
use of every other industry to acquire that which will make me 
usefull to myself and <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>when I go there. I am very impatient to
commence my <location_mentioned>Hacienda </location_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>, but do not like to begin
with my teeth and nails alone remember me to all the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>, and
tell them that my heart and soul is with them and it is against my
will that my body is not also, but that when it goes I wish it to go
provided—one of my greatest pleasures is the anticipation of the
society of my old <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>countrymen </person_mentioned>in one of the most 
delightfull countries in the world, and most particularly of one, for the
sake of whose company one week at this time I would willingly put
myself on the diet of <hi rend="italic">catfish and wild onions without salt or greas</hi>,
again for a few days.</p>

<p>It is not worth the time to write me at this place as I shall set out
in a month if you write home let them know where I am—my 
respecte to your <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>and all other <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>acquaintances</person_mentioned>—I
hope to be in <location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>in all the <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1823">month of October</date_mentioned></p>
