dispatch business I proposed to the <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Mr Givens</person_mentioned> and
I would dispatch the articles which you sent for—and I would write to
<person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>which I did in your name and my own. I believe we have sent
you what you wanted and put up in as good order as circumstances would
permit.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Express </person_mentioned>was sent post haste to <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>.<person_mentioned> Mr. Batterson</person_mentioned> went to
<location_mentioned>Harrisburg </location_mentioned>himself to bring Cannon.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Council </person_mentioned>have also sent to <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="171"/>

<p>Supposing the <person_mentioned>Council </person_mentioned>have written you particulars I say no more on
the subject of the <person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>We send you some new documents—And the letter from <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>and one
from <person_mentioned>Padilla </person_mentioned>and another from <person_mentioned>Capt Collinsworth</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Ought not <person_mentioned>Cos</person_mentioned>' two leeters be published as also your answer? If so,
send them back the first opportunity, and all other matter which you
wish published. Our <location_mentioned>paper </location_mentioned>did not come out till <date_mentioned n="10-10-1835">this evening</date_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Col Ward</person_mentioned>
could not wait, and we have hired an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>to carry the <location_mentioned>papers </location_mentioned>till his
carriage is over taken.</p>

<p>Though it is indispensable that I should devote most of my time in the
<location_mentioned>land office</location_mentioned> yet I am willing to contribute what I can.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Baker</person_mentioned> says he ought to be in the <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>brother Tom</person_mentioned> says he also
should be with you but indeed if they leave we never can get along with
the <location_mentioned>paper </location_mentioned>which is of more importance than their services can be in the
<location_mentioned>Camp</location_mentioned></p>

<p>They say it will be said, we do not turn out. But we work night and
day—<person_mentioned>Mr Toy</person_mentioned> has scarcely slept for two night.</p>

<p>You can represent the matter if you hear anything said. I shall 
endeavor to prevent their going, for my maxim is Do the best for my 
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, praise or no praise.</p>
