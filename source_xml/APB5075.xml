<p>Confidential	<location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-14-1835">Decr. 14. 1835 </date_mentioned>At night—</p>

<p>To the <person_mentioned>provisional Gov.t of Texas</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>On my arrival here <date_mentioned n="12-14-1835">this afternoon</date_mentioned>, I met <person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Col. Pettus</person_mentioned> on
horseback starting for <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned></p>

<p>The first informed me that the principal object of his journey to <location_mentioned>San
Felipe</location_mentioned>, was to inform the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt</person_mentioned> of the nature of his relations,
and of the situation of things in the <location_mentioned>interior</location_mentioned>— As these matters are of the
greatest importance, he returned with me to this place, and we have had a
conference of much interest to the general good of the cause we are 
defending, but more especially to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. He has shown me his correspondence
with <person_mentioned>persons of the highest standing</person_mentioned>, especially a letter which he recd. a
few days since by a <person_mentioned>confidential express</person_mentioned> from the <location_mentioned>interior</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have not time to write fully on this all important subject, nor will my
health (exhausted as I am by the ride down) permit it or to enter into long
details, which I will do from my <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>brother in law</person_mentioned>'s</location_mentioned> or from <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>; I will
therefore at present merely say that the general good seems to require—</p>

<p>First—That <person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> should return with as little delay as possible to
<location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned>, where his presence is necessary for the furtherance of the plans
and combinations that are made and maturing in the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>in favor of
federalism, and of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. These plans are very extensive and are 
calculated to cover and secure <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>effectually, provided we adhere <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi>, in
words, acts, and deeds, to the declaration of the consultation of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7th 
November last</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>2.d	That as a part of his <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>marched <date_mentioned n="12-13-1835">yesterday</date_mentioned>, [with] <person_mentioned>Cap Allin's
Company</person_mentioned>, for <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, the balance should proceed to <location_mentioned>Copano </location_mentioned>by water, for
which purpose they have gone to <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>, and should take the two long
brass sixes and two iron ones and the arms and shot, which will be very
usefull either in the siege of <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>or in other operations in that <location_mentioned>quarter</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>3.d	That as he has spent $18,000 in this expedition, and places the 
cannon (the two brass ones cost $400 each), and shot, of which there is a good
supply, at the disposition of the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to be used in<barker_pb n="283"/>
defense of the common cause, at least one thousand dollars should be 
furnished him, to meet his present exigencies, for he is without a dollar.</p>

<p>He requests me to say that whether he goes to <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, or wherever he
may be, he wishes to be considered a <person_mentioned>citizen of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— He has a 
considerable interest in the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I am more and more convinced every day, and especially on calm 
reflection during a solitary ride down here, that the political position of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
should continue as established by the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7th Novr. last</date_mentioned>. This
declaration secures to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">everything</hi>, and without any hazard, for it
satisfies the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned>, and is sufficient to secure their support and 
cooperation, should the federal system fall, the 5 article is a declaration of
independence as a matter of course. I think that a constitution ought to be
formed and a <person_mentioned>permanent Govt.</person_mentioned> established on the basis of said declarations,
and that the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt.</person_mentioned> should <hi rend="italic">not legislate any more</hi>, if possible to
avoid it—</p>

<p>A change of the basis now, to that of independence, w.d give us no more
than is secured by the declaration, provided a constitution is formed, but
it would injure us abroad by giving an idea that we are unstable in our
opinions and it would paralise the efforts of the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> which are
now in our favor, and no doubt turn them against us— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>ought 
therefore to adhere rigidly and firmly to the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Nov.r</date_mentioned> and the
public acts should correspond with it, in <hi rend="italic">words </hi>and in <hi rend="italic">object</hi>, without 
regarding the opinions of excited moments, no matter by whom expressed.
These are my firm convictions, after the most calm reflection.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> is compelled to go to <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>, to make arrangements to start
his <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Copano </location_mentioned>under the command of <person_mentioned>Col Peraza</person_mentioned>, in case he does not
go himself, from that place, I will inform you of his final conclusions—
These will be made with a view to the <hi rend="italic">good of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></hi>— of this you need
have no doubt whatever—</p>

<p>I am told that letters of <hi rend="italic">recent </hi>date have been rec.d from <person_mentioned>persons of high
standing</person_mentioned> and correct information as to Mexican and Texas politics, and as
to the opinions with <person_mentioned>men of judgement</person_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> which say, "Make no
change in your declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Novr.</date_mentioned> and do not even pronounce the word
independence in a whisper."</p>

<p>I have given you my opinion frankly— will write again from <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>—
in the meantime I recommend that some provision be made, if any can be,
to supply <person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> with $1000— I go below early <date_mentioned n="12-15-1835">tomorrow morning</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>I will add I have full confidence in the good faith and sincerity of <person_mentioned>Genl
Mexia</person_mentioned> in his efforts and desires to serve the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p><barker_pb n="284"/>

<p>The address to the <person_mentioned>Mexican peopl</person_mentioned>e sh.d be sent into the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>by every
possible means—send a number to <person_mentioned>McKinney</person_mentioned> for me and <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>and send
them to <location_mentioned>Goliad </location_mentioned><location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned>and every where—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I think the situation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, may in a great degree, depend on 
adhering to the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Novr.</date_mentioned> and on enlisting the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> in our
favor— I repeat this idea so often, because I am satisfied much depends
on it.</p>

<p>I have marked this letter <hi rend="italic">confidential</hi>, because I do not wish that part of
it that speaks of the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>published in print, but if my opinion will do
any good as to adhering to the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Novr.</date_mentioned> you can make any
use of those opinions you think proper</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>read and referred to <person_mentioned>select committee of 5</person_mentioned>.</p>
