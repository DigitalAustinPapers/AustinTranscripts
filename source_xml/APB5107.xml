<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>All goes well in <location_mentioned>this part of the world</location_mentioned> in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—That <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>
is rising dayly. Public opinion however expects and calls for an absolute
declaration of independence without any delay</p>

<p>Any serious divisions amongst the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>there will ruin <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in this
country—I wish you all to unite on the basis of independence</p>

<p>My health is much improved—We have effected a loan for $200,000,
but only get 20 per cent advance at this time—The balance is to be paid
after the loan is ratified by the <person_mentioned>convention</person_mentioned>, which I hope it will be without
delay— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will be ruined if it is not— It is to be repaid in money at
8 pr cent interest, or in <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>at fifty cents an acre— We shall probably
close another loan <date_mentioned n="01-18-1835">today </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="01-19-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>for 40,000 or 50,000 more also 
payable in <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>at same price, with an allowance for prompt payment, 
brokerage etc</p>

<p>There is no news from <person_mentioned>W.</person_mentioned> God knows what has become of him— you
will recollect that he had no authority to pledge any of my <location_mentioned>property</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Love to <person_mentioned>sister </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>— Shall try to be at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>the <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1836">first week in
March</date_mentioned>— I sent the plan of a flag to <person_mentioned>Borden </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>which I think is
historic—farewell</p>

<p>[S. F. Austin]</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. James F. Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach point near Brazoria</location_mentioned></p>
