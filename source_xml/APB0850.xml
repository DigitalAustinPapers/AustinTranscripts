<p>My dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>/</p>

<p>I improve the present opportunity of writing you by <person_mentioned>Mr Hale</person_mentioned>,
lest my letters to you previous to this Should miscarry as I wrote
by mail, directed to the care of <person_mentioned>Cable </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I presume ere this you have heard of our irreparable loss in the
death of dearly beloved <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>, and also of <person_mentioned>Aunt Austin</person_mentioned>. So many
unhappy changes, have taken place in <location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>since I left it that
I long to be with you once more in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Another change tho not of so unpleasant a nature is Shortly to
transpire in our <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, which is, the marriage of our <person_mentioned>Sister Emily</person_mentioned>,
with <person_mentioned>Mr James F. Perry of <location_mentioned>Mine A Burton</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>!! I confess that I was
as much Surprized as you will be, when she informed me of it, a few
days ago:—<person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>asked my advice on the Subject:—my reply to
her was, that <hi rend="italic">She </hi>knew whether her marriage with <person_mentioned>Mr P.</person_mentioned> would be
conducive to her happiness or not if She considered it would, I
acquiesed with cheerfulness and made no doubt you would do the
Same— I only regret that it will be impossible for us to collect the
remains of our unfortunate <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>together for some years; <hi rend="italic">if ever.</hi>
As to <person_mentioned>Mr. P</person_mentioned> you are acquainted with him and best know w[h]ether
her choice is a judicious one or not, his Standing is high and morals
unexceptionable—</p>

<p>I intend to leave here some time next month So as to be in <location_mentioned>Ns.
[Natchitoches]</location_mentioned> by the <date_mentioned n="11-01-1824">1st of Novr</date_mentioned>. I should like to hear from you
before I start but the dread of spending a <date_mentioned n="Winter-1824">winter </date_mentioned>in this <hi rend="italic">"cursed
land"</hi> determines me to leave it, my expences will be light returning,
as I Shall be alone, I have nearly all the money by me still; and
will not spend one cent more than I possibly can help untill I hear
from you which I hope to on my arrival at <location_mentioned>Natchs</location_mentioned>. I shall take on
