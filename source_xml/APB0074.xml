<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have for a long time wished to see you, but from a number of
causes I have been prevented, I think the contemplated change of
our <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>Demands the attention of every <person_mentioned>American </person_mentioned>and that
by a well timed union of opinion and <hi rend="italic">measures </hi>the situation of the
<person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>in the country may be changed I think its likely that the
<person_mentioned>French Government</person_mentioned> will be ready to take such steps as will be most
likely to extend the improvements of this <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>I have thought
that if the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>were to form something like a <hi rend="italic">committee </hi>to
form a congratulatory address to be presented to our <person_mentioned>New Officers</person_mentioned>
and at the same time stating the many advantages that would accrue
from a proper encouragement of <hi rend="italic">commerce </hi>and agriculture, it would
have a good effect, and I think it would bring the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>into
notice If you think with me and are of the same opinion, you will
be so good as to write me. But if not then you will destroy this
letter and consider it of no consequence; I depend on your honor in
keeping within your Breast what I have mentioned, until such time
as it may be properly mentioned, be assured my dear Sir I have 
nothing in View but to render the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>as respectable
as possible, and to do this I think due attention ought to be given to
the <person_mentioned>Officers </person_mentioned>of the <person_mentioned>new Government</person_mentioned> on their arrival; for in my
opinion the first impressions are always the best</p>

<p>I am Dear Sir With Respect</p>
<p>Yours</p>

<p><person_mentioned>M. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
