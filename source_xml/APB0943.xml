<p><person_mentioned>Honble Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir. I have nothing new to inform you of relative to the
intentions of <person_mentioned>Mrs Hawkins</person_mentioned>, further than what I mentioned in my
last letter some weeks ago—I do not believe <person_mentioned>Mr Sanders</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr
Hawes</person_mentioned> will ever agree that she should move to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>while her
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>are so young and helpless—If her boys were older and had
more Judgement and Experience in the world I dont believe she
would be controlled but alas the children have been so much 
neglected that even at an advanced age I fear they will be illy calculated
to take care of themselves even—</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it has been by all decided that you
are to act in the capacity of <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Mrs Hawkins</person_mentioned> and
the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>; this decision meets my most sanguine approbation, as
I am assured she could get no person so well quallified to represent
her Interest in the provenee—-I hope therefore you will not let your
delicacy prevent your accepting such a trust—</p>

<p>On the subject of the advances made by <person_mentioned>Mr Hawkins</person_mentioned> it never was
my opinion that you were any otherwise bound than for one half
of All lands granted to you by the <person_mentioned>Mexican Government</person_mentioned>—and that
the only source of remuneration would be from a sale thereof,—</p>

<p>There has been many small sums loaned to individuals going to
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and for which they are bound these I will send you a list
of at a more convenient time and request you to have them collected—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Nath: Cox.</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Botts</person_mentioned> is now here and I believe intends writing you by <person_mentioned>Mr
Parker</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>bear[er]</person_mentioned> of this.</p>
