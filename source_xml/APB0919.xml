<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>A few days since I recd by <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> your letter of the <date_mentioned n="10-26-1824">26th Ult</date_mentioned>:—
which afforded me much satisfaction, to know the flattering 
prospects of a pure and permanent government in your delightful and
fertile country—And I can in truth say that I am not a little 
gratified to learn from <person_mentioned>Mr. Huff</person_mentioned> that he is well pleased with the country
and that you have been so liberal with him as to induce him and his
partner <person_mentioned>Mr. Servison</person_mentioned> to embark immediately on improvements which
will not only benefit them and their <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, but will no doubt
greatly advance the public weal of the Colony—Those men are now
making preparations to carry into effect with promptness, and in
good faith, everything which <person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> agreed to do in their Articles
with you—And I feel satisfied that you will be pleased with the
performance on their part—They will be able to take with them
every facility necessary to complete the works in a reasonable time—
The present plan is to Charter a steam-Boat as the most safe and
easy means of conveying the whole out fit to <location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>Colo Child</person_mentioned> left here a day or two since for <location_mentioned>Natchez</location_mentioned>, where he will
endeavor to make the arrangements for the steam-Boat—If this
arrangement succeeds, I shall no doubt be one of the party myself—
<person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> mentioned to me that you would on my going out and 
compliance with the terms of your government give me a <location_mentioned>Grant </location_mentioned>for two
Leagues of Land adjoining the <location_mentioned>Mill Tract</location_mentioned>, below, on the <location_mentioned>Bernard</location_mentioned>,
and that you would not otherwise dispose of it till you heard from
me—for your friendly disposition towards me in this business, you
have my grateful acknowledgements—And have to request that you<barker_pb n="974"/>
will secure for me the two Leagues of Land above mentioned—<person_mentioned>Mr
Huff</person_mentioned> also mentioned that you spoke of letting me have a grant for
seven Leagues of Land to be located in the <location_mentioned>wood-land</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>between the
Brazos and Bernard</location_mentioned>, on conditions, etc, etc,—I assure you Sir, I 
consider those offers flattering and worthy the attention of any man—
and shall endeavor to avail myself of them, and hope by my feeble
exertions to promote the prosperity of the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, in some degree to
deserve something—I say to you candidly, that when I settle my
family in your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, I shall be extremely solicitous to have as
neighbors, a few respectable acquaintances etc, from this vecinity—
who will be anxious to move with me—all of which I wish you to
bear in mind—And that I shall endeavour to take along <person_mentioned>friends of
Capital</person_mentioned>—who will take with them the means of advancing the 
importance of the Country—-<person_mentioned>Mr Huff</person_mentioned> requests me to say to you that he
will procure for you and take out with him, the Articles which he
promised you.—</p>
