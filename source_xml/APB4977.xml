<p><location_mentioned>Mission of Espada</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-22-1835">22d- octr 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Genl Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>At half after 4 oclk p. M we took possession of this <location_mentioned>Mission</location_mentioned>, with out
any resistance—A <person_mentioned>guard of five men</person_mentioned>, escaped us by only a few minutes—
We find the <person_mentioned>Citizens </person_mentioned>well disposed and quite communicative</p>

<p>A large number of the <person_mentioned>citizens of <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and of this place, are now <hi rend="italic">laying
out</hi>, to prevent being forced to perform the most servile duties—We can
place the most implicit confidence in all the information read from <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>
which is up to 5 oclk p. m. Great consternation was manifested there when
our approach to this point was made known—The <location_mentioned>fortifications </location_mentioned>are nearly
or quite such as before made known to you, with this addition, the <location_mentioned>tops of
the Houses</location_mentioned> and the <location_mentioned>entrance of the Streets</location_mentioned>, are <hi rend="italic">forified</hi>, with unburnt
<hi rend="italic">Brick</hi>, with Port holes, for their <person_mentioned>Infantry</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>They have 8 pieces (4 lb) mounted—and one of larger size preparing
for us. They have <hi rend="italic">none </hi><location_mentioned>on the Church</location_mentioned>—but have removed all their 
ammunition to it, and <hi rend="italic">enclosed </hi>it by a wall, made of wood, six feet apart and
six feet high, filled in with dirt, <location_mentioned>extending from the corners to the ditch</location_mentioned>,
say sixty yards in length—</p>

<p>We are informed that they have not got in corn or other provisions, and
we find it all <hi rend="italic">growing</hi>, or rather, <hi rend="italic">yet <location_mentioned>in the fields</location_mentioned></hi>: and are informed that it
is the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">above</hi> Town</location_mentioned>. When our approach—was ascertained the alarm
was great, and 14 Beef Cattle was ordered to be pened up—The <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>with
whom we have conversed—are decidedly of the opinion, that in <hi rend="italic">five days</hi>,
they can be <hi rend="italic">starved </hi>out.—</p><barker_pb n="203"/>

<p>We propose to explore <hi rend="italic">above </hi>this early <date_mentioned n="10-23-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>—and will occupy the
<location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">nearest point</hi> to Town</location_mentioned>—bearing in mind the necessity of <hi rend="italic">holding </hi><location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned>,
and keeping up a communication with you We would respectfully suggest
the propriety of the main army to take a position <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">above </hi>Town</location_mentioned>, and <hi rend="italic">cut off
</hi>all provisions from <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, and we will attend to it <hi rend="italic">below</hi></p>

<p>This will alarm and intimidate the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>, and inspire our <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>with
renewed confidence, and will affect our object at once—</p>

<p>Should the <person_mentioned>re-inforcements</person_mentioned> arrive, and you can well spare them, <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">fifty
men</hi></person_mentioned> will be acceptable, and we will then be entirely able to <hi rend="italic">take </hi>and <hi rend="italic">hold</hi>
any position, you may please to designate—</p>

<p>Owing to the late hour of our arrival, we have not examined the

soldiers at <location_mentioned>St Jose</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and none at <location_mentioned>St Juan</location_mentioned>—We learn that <hi rend="italic">no public</hi> stores are
collected at either place—The <hi rend="italic">Bean </hi>crops are <hi rend="italic">entirely distroyed</hi>—There is
corn in abundance, but the principal <person_mentioned>owners </person_mentioned>are in <location_mentioned>Town</location_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Couriers</person_mentioned>
will be dispatched early for them, to make contracts with [them] for the
<person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>. There is corn here, but owned by <person_mentioned>men who Rent the <location_mentioned>Land</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and will
sell for <hi rend="italic">cash </hi>only, and only in small quantities</p>

Grande</location_mentioned>—and keep up at night those they have (from 2 to 300) and graze
