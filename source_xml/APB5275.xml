<p>Sir</p>

<p>After parting with you at <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>I proceeded as expeditiously as 
possible to the <location_mentioned>neighbourhood of <person_mentioned>Mr. Landrum</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned>, to whom you gave me an
order for a Horse, and from whom I received none; I was there taken very
Ill, but from the attention paid me by <person_mentioned>Doct: Fitchen</person_mentioned>, I was able in three
days to proceed on my journey, which I was compelled to do even with a
fever, as I could not prevail on any person to go in my place, who I could
depend on:— On arriving at <location_mentioned>Nachadoges</location_mentioned>, I could only get five dollars in
cash, and nine dollars worth of necessary summer apparrell; <person_mentioned>Mr. Thorn
</person_mentioned>was in the <location_mentioned>U. S. of the North</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Upon arriving at <location_mentioned>St. Augustine</location_mentioned> I applyed to <person_mentioned>Mr. Hoghkis</person_mentioned> for funds and
received five dollars of him. Upon arriving at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Genl. Houston</person_mentioned> Quarters</location_mentioned> I
made known my errand to him, he wished me to proceed to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Genl: Ganes</person_mentioned>'
camp</location_mentioned> and deliver the dispatches myself, but could render me no assistance,
although my horse could then scarcely travell at all.— Upon seeing <person_mentioned>Genl:
E P Ganes</person_mentioned>, I delivered the dispatches to him and was again attacked with
the bilious fever; <person_mentioned>Genl Ganes</person_mentioned> requested me to remain a fiew days 
calculating on receiving some information from the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> that would be 
interesting to our government; but upon remaining the length of time he proposed
and finding myself unable to travel; and believing it would be some time
before I should recover my strength; and hearing that <person_mentioned>St. Anna</person_mentioned> was about
to be tried by Court Marshall for murder; and believing he would be shot;
I addressed a letter to <person_mentioned>Genl: Ganes</person_mentioned> on that subject and received in answer
a letter which <person_mentioned>Mr. Moody</person_mentioned> will shew you; I have ever since and still 
continue to be sick or very unwell and weak, or I would have been or even now
would visit <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned>.—</p>

<p>Enclosed you will find a statement of my expenditure on the road, 
togeather with the monies reed. etc.-</p>

<p>It is now my wish to settle myself and endeavour to make a support for
myself and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>; you have a <location_mentioned>Leigue of Land</location_mentioned> not far from this (Viz
<person_mentioned>Grimes</person_mentioned>') called the <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Spring Liegue</location_mentioned></hi> I am informed, which I would be glad
to settle on, if you will exchange with me for the <location_mentioned>Leigue </location_mentioned>that I am entitled
to as a <person_mentioned>settler </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>previous to the Decliration of Independence; and
if you require that any difference be paid you by me <person_mentioned>Mr. Moody</person_mentioned> is fully
authorised to enter into a contract with you to that effect.</p>

<p>I have written to you twice since I arrived at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Genl. Ganes</person_mentioned>' Camp</location_mentioned>; but as
there is no mail and the transportation and safe delivery of letters so 
uncertain; I repeat every thing in this letter feeling certain it will be safely
delivered into your hand,—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Geo: P. Digges</person_mentioned></p>
