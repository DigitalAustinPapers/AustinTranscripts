<p>Sometime since, two settlers of this <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>were hunting deer near
the <location_mentioned>mouth of the Colorado on the East bank</location_mentioned>, when a party of 
<person_mentioned>Karankawase Indians</person_mentioned> rushed out of a grove in which they were concealed,
and followed them at full speed with their arms in readiness, and
other hostile demonstrations. The two <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>withdrew, and after
having joined with others, returned to look for those <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, to
know if they were still hostile like last year, The <person_mentioned>Spies </person_mentioned>who took
the advance found an <location_mentioned>Indian Camp</location_mentioned>, but found in it only one man
and a <person_mentioned>woman</person_mentioned>. They called the <person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>with friendly 
demonstrations, but he assumed a hostile attitude, preparing his arms, upon
which one of the <person_mentioned>Spies </person_mentioned>shot his rifle at him and wounded him; The
<person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>woman </person_mentioned>escaped to the woods. It is not known
whether the <person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>died, but the signs of blood showed that he was
badly wounded They found in the <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned>several articles stolen at
the <location_mentioned>mouth of the Colorado</location_mentioned>, last year, when these <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>killed
the <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>, and destroyed the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>at that point, I have
sent word to the <person_mentioned>Chief of the Karankawases</person_mentioned>, not to allow his men
to go to the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>, until they make peace with the
<person_mentioned>people of this <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and advised him to withdraw with his whole
nation to the <location_mentioned>Mission at Refugio</location_mentioned>, because if they show themselves
here, the <person_mentioned>Colonists </person_mentioned>will avenge the death of their <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>killed by
these <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>. Which disposition I report to you,
hoping that it will meet your Superior approbation.</p>
