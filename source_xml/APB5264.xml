<p><location_mentioned>Victoria </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="09-02-1836">Sepr. 2. 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I am still here. <person_mentioned>Archer </person_mentioned>is on the mend and I think will be able to travel
in a few days in a wagon down to the landing where he can embark— I
shall then proceed home— My own health is not very good, tho I have no
severe attack of fever</p>

<p>I wrote you the other day, requesting that you would put up a <location_mentioned>cabbin</location_mentioned>
with two rooms for me, or if lumber and <person_mentioned>workmen </person_mentioned>can be had, a frame—
the <location_mentioned>log house</location_mentioned> perhaps will be the easiest, and quickest— I need one room
for an office or sitting room, and one for a sleeping room—</p>

<p>I must make your house my <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>for a time say untill <date_mentioned n="Spring-1837">spring </date_mentioned>at least,
and wish to devote the <date_mentioned n="WInter-1836">winter </date_mentioned>to closing and arranging all my business—
I must have one <person_mentioned>clerk </person_mentioned>at least, and perhaps two and there ought to be three
rooms, one for a sleeping room for the <person_mentioned>clerks </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>visitors</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I also wish you to make out an order on <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> for the necessary
mattresses, chairs, tables etc unless they can be had without sending there
I can sell some land and have the money ready for these purposes and
for all the necessary supplies of provisions etc. The sooner you can get
<person_mentioned>workmen </person_mentioned>and put up the <location_mentioned>cabbin </location_mentioned>etc the better— it must have a shingle
roof with extended eves so as [to] keep the wet from driving in etc— I
wish to get <person_mentioned>Joseph Baker</person_mentioned> to assist in closing the land business</p>

<p>These arrangements are made on the supposition that I shall not be
elected— <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>will, I am told, get all the <location_mentioned>east</location_mentioned>, and <location_mentioned>Red river</location_mentioned> now—
Many of the <person_mentioned>old settlers</person_mentioned> who are too blind to see or understand their 
interest will vote for him, and the army I believe will go for him, at least a
majority of them— So that I have a good prospect of some rest this year,
and time to regulate my private affairs, which need regulating very much.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. James F. Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach point below Brazoria</location_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>Col. Le Grand</person_mentioned></p>
