Exoneration of any blame or suspicion of blame that might be
attached to <hi rend="italic">me </hi>in consequence of my being in company With a man
that may have conducted unwisely and thereby drawn disgrace on
himself and endangerd my reputation</p>

<p>The day before I left <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> for the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Kirkham</person_mentioned>

Clandestin manner or to committ any act in violation of your orders
or that of Society. <hi rend="italic">Nor </hi>was there intentions made known to me
untill after I had arrived at the <location_mentioned>River St Marks</location_mentioned>, when I learned from

and that they was to bring with them a Number of Mules which he
<person_mentioned>Kirkham </person_mentioned>had told them he would purchase and give them a safe
conduct to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>. I objected to have anything to do
with them or detain for them unless they brought with them a<barker_pb n="378"/>
pasport, and expostulated with him for having given them any 
encouragement to bring out mules in as much as it Was expressly against
Orders of the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned></hi>he then said that he had not given them any
other encouragement or words that would induce them to bring out
Mules except that If they should do so, he should purchase them, he
then said that the <person_mentioned>Spaniards </person_mentioned>had made a brake on the <person_mentioned>King</person_mentioned>s Yard of
Mules and Horses and taken ten or twelve and Escaped, that before
they left <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> they had stated to some of there <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, that he

Mules— if he did it is unknown to me he most positively <hi rend="italic">denies</hi>
any communication with them except what I have before stated, that
he would purchase the Mules. It is therefore to be clearly 
understood, that I do not accuse <person_mentioned>Kirkham </person_mentioned>of any, <hi rend="italic">Crime </hi>but it is that I
write this letter in consequence of being told that my Name had
been called in question and touching the theft of some mules and
