<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I arrived here on the <date_mentioned n="04-20-1824">20 I[n]st</date_mentioned> after a journey of considerable
delay and fatigue—the Steam B. had left here the morning I arrived
the Hornet will be up this evening and I hope to leave this on the
<date_mentioned n="05-24-1824">morrow </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="05-25-1824">next day</date_mentioned>— I should have proceeded on by land but my
horse was so reduced (owing to the flies and Knats) and the mule
so lame I considered it would be impractable I therefore sent them
out to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>McGuffin</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> to sell if he could if not to send them on by House—</p>

<p>It now becomes my painful task to acquaint you of the death of
our <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>. On my arrival here I proceeded to the <location_mentioned>post Office</location_mentioned>
where I found 2 letters for you one from our much lamented
<person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>, and the other from <person_mentioned>E. Bates</person_mentioned> containing the Sad News— I
enclose them both. We shall soon be left without <person_mentioned>relatives </person_mentioned>Our
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>has been sorely Visited by Divine providence— <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>E. Bates</person_mentioned> are the only ones remaining. I am to much afflicted to
dwell on this subject any longer— All the things you wish for can
not be procured I send 1. ream of Paper the best I can procure—
the Blank Books are of such an inferior quality that I shall send
none— llb- Bar Salts— there in no bunting in the place— The
trunk you left with <person_mentioned>Denny </person_mentioned>was sold at publick sale and every thing
in it except the Mosquito Bar which <person_mentioned>McGuffin </person_mentioned>will send out to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
the first opportunity— I think if an arrangement can be made I had
better return by water—for the expence attending a voyage up this
river at that season of the year will be something let us come in
what way we may— make some determination by the time Thos
<person_mentioned>Alley </person_mentioned>starts— <person_mentioned>Varner </person_mentioned>assures me no difficulty will arise as respects
funds on his part.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>N. Edwards formerly Govr of <location_mentioned>Illinois</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is appointed <person_mentioned>Minister to
Mexico</person_mentioned>—   he is instructed to claim on the part of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> the<barker_pb n="800"/>
country from the <location_mentioned>Sabine </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>Rio Grande</location_mentioned>—   <person_mentioned>Doct Sibly</person_mentioned>—and
