<p><location_mentioned>Colombia Texas</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-19-1836">Novr. 19. 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Hon. T. H. Benton</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Wharton</person_mentioned> returns to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>as the <person_mentioned>Minister plenipotentiary of
this <location_mentioned>Republic</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— The main object of his mission is the <hi rend="italic">annexation </hi>of this
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>U.S.</location_mentioned>— The <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> expressed their wish for this
measure at the general election in <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1836">September</date_mentioned>—only <hi rend="italic">ninety three</hi> voting in
the negative in all <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and about 40 of them were persons who had just
come to the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>from the <location_mentioned>U.S.</location_mentioned> and had not any permanent interests
here— This vote has resulted from the warm attachment of this <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>to
the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>govt</person_mentioned>, of their nativity, and their full confidence in the
liberality and even munificence of that <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, as relates to the terms or
conditions of annexation</p>

<p>Our basis is an equitable reciprocity, keeping in view the claims of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
upon the toils and sufferings of years in redeeming this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>from the
<location_mentioned>wilderness</location_mentioned>, and achieving its independence— We took up arms against
<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>to secure the right of self Govt. We consider that we have secured
that right, and consequently expect to retain it as a state when annexed to
the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> The <person_mentioned>population of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is sufficient to become a state under the
constitution and laws of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and it is therefore confidently expected
that no objections will be made to going into a <person_mentioned>state Govt</person_mentioned>, without passing
through the intermediate stage of a <person_mentioned>territorial Govt.</person_mentioned>— I cannot see that
any objection can be made to this course The <person_mentioned>officers in office</person_mentioned> and laws of
this <location_mentioned>Republic </location_mentioned>in force at the time of the ratification should continue untill
the state constitution was formed and the <person_mentioned>state Govt</person_mentioned>, organized Supposing
that the treaty of annexation should be ratified by <date_mentioned n="Spring-1837">next spring</date_mentioned>—Military
possession would be immediately taken by the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned>— The <person_mentioned>civil govt,</person_mentioned>
would go on as organized at that time—A convention would meet and form
the state constitution so as to present it to the <person_mentioned>next congress of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
for approval—there would be no interregnum no sudden changes of 
<person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>etc There will in fact be only a change of name and we shall avoid
all the confusion, and perhaps I should say, degradation, of descending
from a <location_mentioned>Free Republic</location_mentioned>, to a <location_mentioned>dependent Territory</location_mentioned>, before we can be a <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>As to the future subdivision of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>into a <location_mentioned>plurality of states</location_mentioned> or 
<location_mentioned>territories</location_mentioned>—equity evidently requires that it should be left intirely and 
exclusively to the option and decision of the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>

<p>I do not anticipate any difficulty as to the terms of annexation—we 
expect nothing unreasonable, and have full confidence that what is equitable
will be granted.</p><barker_pb n="456"/>

<p>I must solicit your support in this matter and that you will extend to
<person_mentioned>Mr. Wharton</person_mentioned> such aid as may be proper</p>
