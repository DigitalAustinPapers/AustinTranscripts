of <date_mentioned n="06-01-1836">1 June</date_mentioned> were sent by me to <person_mentioned>Gen. E. P. Gains</person_mentioned>, by <person_mentioned>Geo. P. Digges</person_mentioned> who went
<person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>, also my letters to <person_mentioned>Gen Jackson</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Gen Gains</person_mentioned>, of <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">same date</date_mentioned> and
to <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Collingsworth </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned>s letter to <person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>
approving of the establishment of his <location_mentioned>head quarters at Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, should he,
<person_mentioned>Gains</person_mentioned>, think proper to do so, for the purpose of keeping the <person_mentioned>northern 
indians</person_mentioned> quiet— This letter is dated <date_mentioned n="06-28-1836">June 28</date_mentioned>, and was written by <person_mentioned>Burnet </person_mentioned>at
my suggestion, the day after my arrival at <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>from the<location_mentioned> U. S</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>Gen Jose Urrea</person_mentioned> was delivered to me, open, to
<person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned> at <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>the <date_mentioned n="07-08-1836">8th of July</date_mentioned>, and sent by him and a 
translation of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>Jackson </person_mentioned>the next day to <person_mentioned>Gen M. B. Lamar </person_mentioned>in
the <person_mentioned>Texas army</person_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Capt. Roman</person_mentioned>— I had previously shown it at <location_mentioned>Brazoria</location_mentioned>
to <person_mentioned>Lamar </person_mentioned>on my way down from <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="07-06-1836">6th July</date_mentioned> and wished him
to take it then, so as to save delay, for he was just starting for the <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>
to assume the chief command, but he preferred that it should be sent to him
officially by <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned> observing that the opinions he had sustained
while in the <person_mentioned>cabinet</person_mentioned>, against any kind of treaty with <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>, or making
any use of him at all for the purpose of terminating the war etc, precluded
him from taking any active part in the matter, but that, as <person_mentioned>commander of
the army</person_mentioned> he would co-operate with the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and interpose no obstacles</p>

<p>The day I arrived at <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>, (late in the evening of <date_mentioned n="06-27-1836">27th June</date_mentioned>) I 
represented to <person_mentioned>president Burnet</person_mentioned> the great importance of writing officially once a
week if possible to the <person_mentioned>representatives of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and stated it as my opinion that the omission of this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, in not 
furnishing to those <person_mentioned>representatives</person_mentioned>, whoever they might be, official reports of
the battle of <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> and of the organization of the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and
general situation of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>etc had been fatal to the interests of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
as I believed that our independence would have been acknowledged by the
<person_mentioned><location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> govt</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>if those official documents had been sent in on
time— Nothing of the kind was ever sent on—those of us, (<person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>,

nothing, not even one word from their <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, and had nothing to operate
with, in their exertions to procure a recognition of our independence, but

Orleans </location_mentioned>etc—</p>

bound to <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>) and enclosed certified copies of <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letters
to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Gen Urrea</person_mentioned>, and of the treaties of <date_mentioned n="05-14-1836">14th May</date_mentioned> etc I
