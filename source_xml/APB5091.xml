<p><location_mentioned>Quintana </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-25-1835">Decr. 25. 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr James F. Perry</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I have had a conversation, with <person_mentioned>McKinny </person_mentioned>about laying off a <location_mentioned>town </location_mentioned>at this
place— There are a number of applicants for <location_mentioned>lots</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I never realized any thing out of the <location_mentioned>lots at Brazoria</location_mentioned> and I do not wish
that the same result should take place as to this place—others can make
money in this way, and I see no just cause why I should not</p>

<p>After <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>returns, you and <person_mentioned>McKinny </person_mentioned>and he can consult on the
subject, and lay out the <location_mentioned>lots </location_mentioned>here, have a handsome <location_mentioned>map </location_mentioned>made of them, and
sell them to the best advantage without waiting for my return</p>

<p>I wish to retain some lots in a good situation for <location_mentioned>business</location_mentioned>, and some for
<location_mentioned>building residences</location_mentioned>—the next <location_mentioned>block below McKinny and Williams's ware
house</location_mentioned> are the best for the first object you will retain them for me and
some high back lots for the second You will also want a place to build a
<location_mentioned>retreat </location_mentioned>in the sickly season.</p>

<p>You can however arrange this matter amongst you, as may be deemed
best for my interest and future convenience for I trust the matter to you as
persons who will not neglect what is due to an absent friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>McKinny </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>are to have the <location_mentioned>lots </location_mentioned>where their <location_mentioned>ware house</location_mentioned> is. I
will settle this matter with them when I return You will of course lay out
no <location_mentioned>lots </location_mentioned>nor make any disposition of the <location_mentioned>land above the creek</location_mentioned>, (<location_mentioned>west union</location_mentioned>)
what is below will be sufficient for the present—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>is a good hand at arranging speculations of this kind to the
best advantage— Great pains have been taken by my <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>
to sow suspicion in my mind against him—all this is intrigue of the basest
kind—pay no attention to such stuff—I have told you the same verbally<barker_pb n="295"/>
and now repeat it in writing, and that my confidence in him is in no way
affected by such efforts—I have written to him to transfer the <location_mentioned>eleven league
tract</location_mentioned> of mine which is in his name to you or to me, or give some 
memorandum how that tract stands—it was selected by me on the <location_mentioned>east side of 
colorado at the foot of the Mountains</location_mentioned>, surveyed by <person_mentioned>Sam. P Browne</person_mentioned> All these
matters should be settled or reduced to writing so as to be understood in
case of death—My object now is to close all my unsettled affairs, pay all
debts and try to fix myself so as to be comfortable and in a situation to
make my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>so—a few days with <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>aid will enable you to 
understand how my affairs stand—but it must not be neglected and put off—
attend to it at once and to the a/c with <person_mentioned>John Austin's estate</person_mentioned> as soon as 
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>returns and have all these things finished and put to writing— If I
have heretofore been too careless and negligent as to such things, I shall in
future be on the opposite extreme and press the closing of all my unsettled
business, I therefore request that you will loose no time at all after 
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>return—attending to all these matters and closing them as fast as
possible—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>To avoid all difficulty or misunderstanding in case of my death I will
now say to you that I intend to make a present to <person_mentioned>McKinny </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>
of the <location_mentioned>lot </location_mentioned>where their <location_mentioned>ware house</location_mentioned> is, and should I never return you will
consider this a full authority to make that disposition of it—I will also
state that I consider myself bound individually to refund to them the money
they advanced to <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Jack </person_mentioned>to go to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and also for my drafts
on them—the same as to the money advanced by <person_mentioned>J. H. Bell</person_mentioned> and yourself or
any other of my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>for my assistance when in <location_mentioned>prison </location_mentioned>and under 
prosecution in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>in the service of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr James F. Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach Point</location_mentioned></p>
