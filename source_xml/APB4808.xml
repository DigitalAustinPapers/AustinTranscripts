<p>Wednesday Evening, [about June 22, 1835]</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Dr. Perry</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I have but just arrived from <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> and would have come over
but am exceedingly fatigued. Our <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is again assailed by <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>aspirants</person_mentioned></hi>
and <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>speculators</person_mentioned></hi>, they are attempting to deceive the people by preaching to
them of the dangers that await us at <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> it was got up for the
purpose of sustaining the <hi rend="italic">Mammouth Speculation.</hi> But thank God it has
not had the effect it was expected, the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>I hope will not suffer 
themselves to be thus imposed upon. They are now attempting to raise <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>to go
and release the <person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>as he is necessary to them and bring him to
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>They talk of nothing but declaring Ourselves <hi rend="italic">Independent </hi>of
Granting letters of Marque and reprisal and all such nonsense We must
attend to them they must and will be put down. Nothing has been heard
of <person_mentioned>Col. Austin</person_mentioned> lately that they may do him much Injury I am sorely
afraid But on the present Occasion nothing can come in competition
with <hi rend="italic">their Interest</hi>— and self <hi rend="italic">aggrandizement</hi>. those at the head of the
list at <location_mentioned>San Fellipe</location_mentioned> is <person_mentioned>Saml M Williams</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Frank Johnson Baker at <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.
<person_mentioned>Doct. Archer</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>John A Wharton</person_mentioned> and to my great astonishment, <person_mentioned>Wm- H Jack</person_mentioned></p>
