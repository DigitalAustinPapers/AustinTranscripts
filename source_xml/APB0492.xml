<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I have twice written you but receiving no answer
presume my letters did not reach you. Chance has thrown in my
way your letter to <person_mentioned>Mr. Hawkins</person_mentioned> dated at <location_mentioned>La Bahia</location_mentioned> in <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1821">Sept. last.</date_mentioned></p>

<p>This with the information I had previously received of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
induced me to wish to emigrate there and the object of my former
letters has been to enquire of the country and to ascertain if a 
[surveyor] could have a prospect of employment in surveying which is
my occupation. I have a small <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and industry and honesty
will be our principal property. I have now a chance as I expect of
sending this by private conveyance to <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>. If it should
meet your eye I should be glad to receive a line from you addressed
to me at this place, containing such information on the foregoing
topics as your information and leisure will permit.</p>

<p>Recently I have seen the project of <person_mentioned>Iturbide </person_mentioned>for the government
of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Will not his <hi rend="italic">Monarchial Government</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Non-toleration</hi> be a
great check to the emigration of <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Roswell Mills.</person_mentioned></p>
