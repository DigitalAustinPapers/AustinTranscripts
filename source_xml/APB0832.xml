<p>Austin to José Antonio Saucedo, August 26, 1824. Settlers on the San Jacinto want Austin's colony extended to include them.</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="body">

<p>There are, on the <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned>, some <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>who wish to be
admitted as a part of the <person_mentioned>300 families</person_mentioned> which I have been authorized
by the <person_mentioned>Supreme Government</person_mentioned> to establish in this, the <location_mentioned>province of
Texas</location_mentioned>. If you allow me to extend this colonial Establishment, so as
to include both banks and the <location_mentioned>tributaries </location_mentioned>of the above mentioned
River, and also the <location_mentioned>Bay </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Island of Galveston</location_mentioned>, I believe a great
advantage would be derived by the balance of this Establishment, as
well as the whole <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned>; because the civil jurisdiction of this
Establishment would then embrace those points; and thus the 
introduction of <person_mentioned>vagrants </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>fugitives </person_mentioned>could be prevented, and good order
preserved, particularly in the <location_mentioned>Island </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Bay of Galveston</location_mentioned>, which
formerly were infested by <person_mentioned>pirates</person_mentioned>, and undoubtedly will be so again,
if steps are not taken to prevent it. In case this extension should
meet your approval, I request you to give notice to the <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned><barker_pb n="881"/>
of those localities, that the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>has included the <location_mentioned>territories
situated on the San Jacinto</location_mentioned>, and its waters, and the <location_mentioned>Island of 
Galveston</location_mentioned> in my colonial Establishment; and that those amongst them who
deserve to be admitted, may obtain land in the same manner as the
<person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>of this Establishment, and may select one or two <person_mentioned>Alcaldes</person_mentioned>
who shall depend on this jurisdiction in like manner with the other
<person_mentioned>Alcaldes </person_mentioned>of this Establishment, agreeably to the terms of the 
provisional regulations approved by you for this Establishment, the <date_mentioned n="05-24-1824">24th
of May last</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>God and Liberty.</p>
