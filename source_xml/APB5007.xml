<p><location_mentioned>Head Quarters on the Canal above Bexar</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">Oct. 31st 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>To <person_mentioned>Colo. James Bowie </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Capn. Fanning,</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I have taken a position on the <location_mentioned>Alamo Canal</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>at the mouth of a dry gully
about one mile from town</location_mentioned>,—There is one, a little nearer, but it can not be
occupied <date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">to day</date_mentioned>— I have certain information that all the surplus horses
except about 250 or 200, were started to <location_mentioned>Laredo </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">last night</date_mentioned>. The number
that left is reported at 900 head— The <person_mentioned>escort </person_mentioned>does not exceed twenty or
<person_mentioned>thirty men</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have dispatched <person_mentioned>Capn. Travis</person_mentioned> with <person_mentioned>50 men </person_mentioned>to overtake and capture
them— He has good <person_mentioned>guides </person_mentioned>and I have no doubt will succeed—</p>

<p>I have to inform you that a <person_mentioned>servant </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Antonio de la Garza</person_mentioned> came into
<location_mentioned>camp </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">today </date_mentioned>bringing a proposition from the greater part of the <person_mentioned>S. 
Fernando Company of Cavalry</person_mentioned>, and the one of <location_mentioned>Rio-Grande</location_mentioned>—to desert— This
man was sent to procure a guarantee for them, when they come out— I
have given the guarantee and have now to communicate, to you <hi rend="italic">the mode</hi>
in which they will come out to us—when etc.— He says they will be obliged
to come in the <hi rend="italic">day time</hi>, upon some occasion of alarm, when they are 
ordered out,— These <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>are stationed in the <location_mentioned>house of <person_mentioned>Padilla</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>in one of
the lower <hi rend="italic">labors </hi></location_mentioned>which <person_mentioned>Col.° Bowie</person_mentioned> understands the situation of— It would
be well then for you <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">to morrow</date_mentioned> to make a diversion on that side, so as to
produce the necessary stir; so that they may be ordered out, and thus give
these <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>the chance to come out as it were on duty and then escape—
They will present themselves with the britch of their guns advanced or a
white flag— <person_mentioned>Padilla </person_mentioned>has many <person_mentioned>acquaintances </person_mentioned>in those <person_mentioned>companies</person_mentioned>, who sent
in <person_mentioned>Garza's servant (Jose Ortis)</person_mentioned> to have an understanding with him as to
the guarantee and the mode of joining us.—</p>

<p>In regard to the measure of harassing the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">to night</date_mentioned> as was spoken
of, before we parted, by simultaneous firing on the <location_mentioned>town</location_mentioned>, I have <date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">today</date_mentioned>
thot I am obliged to decline it; owing partly to the condition of the <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>
here at present, having lost so much sleep <date_mentioned n="10-30-1835">last night</date_mentioned>; and partly to the
difficulty of crossing the <location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>from here, so as to cooperate in time with
the <person_mentioned>men on foot</person_mentioned>— As you will make a diversion <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>for the purpose
of bringing out the <person_mentioned>Deserters</person_mentioned>, you will therefore decline anything of the
kind tonight unless you think it better to proceed on your part— If you
think so you can act as you think best, in that respect, but without expecting<barker_pb n="226"/>
any cooperation from <location_mentioned>this quarter</location_mentioned>, for the reason I have mentioned— I will
however mention that a few <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>from here may probably fire on the <location_mentioned>Alamo</location_mentioned>,
which is you know <location_mentioned>on this side of the River</location_mentioned>—about <hi rend="italic">moon down</hi>—</p>

<p>As there is abundance of corn here, you can use that brought by <person_mentioned>Seguin</person_mentioned>
for your <person_mentioned>Detachment</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I wish you to send to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Seguin</person_mentioned>s Ranch</location_mentioned> for some rockets that are there—
2 or 3 dozen— In Spanish they are called quetes pronounced quates—we
may want them—</p>

<p>Please to give me your opinions and those of your <person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>as to the mode
of further operation on the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>By order</p>
<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
<p><person_mentioned>W. D. C. Hall Adjt Gen</person_mentioned></p>.
<p>Dispatch the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned>with your answer <date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">to night</date_mentioned> as soon possible</p>
<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>
<p>I wish your opinions as to storming or besieging—</p>
