<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Tone</person_mentioned> wishes Me to request you not to consider him as <person_mentioned>settler</person_mentioned>
in this <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>, for this reason, that he is a <person_mentioned>Man of a family</person_mentioned> and
ought to be entitled to the same priviliges as other Men of families,
and as you have now coupled <person_mentioned>Mr B. Rawls</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>O. H. Stout</person_mentioned> together
perhaps it is now consistent with your affairs to grant <person_mentioned>Mr. Tone</person_mentioned> a
League the same with other <person_mentioned>men of families</person_mentioned>, I have no More to add,
only that <person_mentioned>Mr. Tone</person_mentioned> has suffered in this country with the rest of us,
and is what a Man ought to be—</p>

<p>Sir it appears that some disturbance is like to arise in consequence
of the division of the Leagues, when two Men is coupled together
and Making choice in different Leagues, and threatening if they
cannot have their land so and so they will go to the <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Guadaloupe</hi></location_mentioned>
Some regulation on this subject from you will aid disputes of this
kind.</p>

<p>We have run of 11 Leagues and find the bottom is growing wider
than what was laid down by the plot by about 700 bars on the <location_mentioned>lower<barker_pb n="978"/>
line of the 4th Range</location_mentioned>. I shall therefore average the Leagues so as to
take in that distance and retain their same distance in the <location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>
unless other ways ordered</p>

<p>Any alteration or orders you shall order will be thankfully recd
by your</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Seth Ingram</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
