<p>Dear friend <person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned></p>

<p>It is now some time since I recd a letter from you, it is six weeks
since I left <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>, but having no information of your having passed
there, I presume you are in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>yet to which place I direct this
letter, believing that you understand your business, and knowing
the confused state of public affairs I have no idea you will leave
there soon - I will say but little untill I receive your answer - I am
in good health but doing a very slender business, I intend to go to
<location_mentioned>Durango </location_mentioned>in a month or two if nothing particular takes place, but
shall be here long enough to receive your ansr I am a candidate
of the office of <person_mentioned>surveyor </person_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned>province of Texas</location_mentioned>, if a removal should
take place which might be the case the reasons I advance in my
letter to the <person_mentioned>Revd Doctr Dn Miguel Ramos de Arispe</person_mentioned> who is my
<person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>are the following—all the necessities of running the surveys
according to the true meridian which must be ascertained by the
surveyor in sd <location_mentioned>province </location_mentioned>- of calculating the contents by Lat. and
depart. the only true method, likewise the ability of the <person_mentioned>surveyor </person_mentioned>to
do all this, keep his records in Spanish, speak English and attend
personally to the work, all of which are very assencial to the peace
and quietude of the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>and consequently to government,
to do all this, to the satisfaction of <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>, I pledge
my [self], your friendship in this can be of much service - seeing
that my profession can do but little for me in the country I have
thought sometimes of establishing myself on a <location_mentioned>farm </location_mentioned>near <location_mentioned>the falls
on the Collorado</location_mentioned> with about 20 of those labouring <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>but I am
in much hesitation what to do, I wish to hear from you very much
concerning your ideas prospects etc. If the <person_mentioned>Doct. Hamos</person_mentioned> should be
in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>I wish very much you would seek an acquaintance with
him, the first introduction to which may be a visit on my part with
my best wishes for his health etc. which I believe is the mode of the<barker_pb n="631"/>
country - you will be pleased with him no doubt and my particular
<person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Ximenes del Rio</person_mentioned> who must never be forgotten if he should be
with the <person_mentioned>Doct</person_mentioned>. or in the <location_mentioned>House of <person_mentioned>Mrs. Odonohu</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> where he hitherto
lived for he is an excellent youth</p>
