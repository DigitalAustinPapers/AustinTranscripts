<p><person_mentioned>Genl S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>My Dr Sir</p>

<p>By the enclosed extracts of the <location_mentioned>Newspapers </location_mentioned>of this City you will perceive,
what the public opinion is in reference to <location_mentioned>Tejas </location_mentioned>in consequence of <person_mentioned>Santa
Anna</person_mentioned> about being liberated by the <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>in complyance of the 10th Art°
of the treaty (if such can be called the agreement which <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> made<barker_pb n="387"/>
while in durance) which was prevented by timely interference of some of
our <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, who knowing <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> better than the <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>have 
interposed the legal and manly means to see the expectations of the <person_mentioned>people of
<location_mentioned>Tejas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> not to be paralized by precipitated measures of a few men, whose
object I hope was the advancement of the wellfare of the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, yet it
would have proved to be her total ruin.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great excitement caused and is still continuing by
this measure of the <person_mentioned>Cabinet</person_mentioned>, as you must be yourself perfectly aware of as
you have seen it before your departure from this place, we are using our
best endeavours to keep up the credit of <location_mentioned>Tejas </location_mentioned>in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>,—<person_mentioned>Volunteers</person_mentioned>
are arriving almost dayly destined for your <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>but it is almost 
impossible to get a few dollars fund to despatch them— Many of the best
<person_mentioned>friends of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have become quite cold about contributions, and say that
unless <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> is made an example of the law for the cruel butcheries
of which he is guilty, they would not contribute any thing.</p>

<p>The "Correo Atlantico" whose merits you will sufficiently know how to
appreciate is on the eve of stopping. —The <person_mentioned>Editor Mr. Santangelo</person_mentioned> can not
get any subscriptions to defray the expences of printing which is $33 pr.
week, say nothing about paying carriers, packing, postages, and other
sundry small expences attending its publication—independent of this he
does not get any recompense for his Editorial labors as you already know
it by his own statement to you.</p>

<p>Since the comencement of the publication of said <location_mentioned>paper </location_mentioned>in this City, (viz
from No. 17 to No. 32. both inclusive) I have paid <person_mentioned>Mr Santangelo</person_mentioned> $520.
towards its printing, in this sum are included $200. which I received from
<person_mentioned>Mr. Saml. M. Williams</person_mentioned> as a contribution and little better than $100 recd
from our <person_mentioned>Mexican friends</person_mentioned>, the Balance is been paid by me at my individual
expence, and as I can not continue any longer to contribute at such rate, I
must stopp my contributions. No. 33. 34. 35. and the next 36. are at the
expence of the <person_mentioned>old Gentleman</person_mentioned>, and as his means are short also he is going
to suspend his labors until he can get some assistance, and the only one I
believe will be by the <person_mentioned>Govnt of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, as it is almost impossible to get 
<person_mentioned>subscribers </person_mentioned>on account of its being devoted to the Cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and against
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, —<person_mentioned>Spaniard</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>French</person_mentioned>, and great many <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>here are against it,
those that are friendly do not subscribe on the plea of being in <person_mentioned>Spanish </person_mentioned>and
can not understand it —But, my, Dr Sir, you are perfectly aware of its good
result in the <location_mentioned>interior of Mexico</location_mentioned>, and it is evident it must if continued, divide
the <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned>, and precipitate the moral and physical revolution of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>,
thus diverting the attention of the <person_mentioned>Governt </person_mentioned>at home, and keeping their <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>
in stead of sending them into <location_mentioned>Tejas</location_mentioned>. —</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="07-08-1836">To morrow</date_mentioned> two of our <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>(<person_mentioned>Montero </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Pinzon</person_mentioned>) are going pr <person_mentioned>Caleb
Goodwin</person_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>, —one (<person_mentioned>coronl. Camara</person_mentioned>) to <location_mentioned>Yucatan</location_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Doct
Portes</person_mentioned> is already gone to <location_mentioned>Tampico</location_mentioned>, those men are called from Mo. for<barker_pb n="388"/>
bringing about the Revolution, and sent from here, by <person_mentioned>Genl Mexia</person_mentioned>, —There
is no doubt that the affairs of the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>are drawn to a focus, and before
very long we must hear news, —<person_mentioned>Genl Ma</person_mentioned>- sent his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned>,
they left here <date_mentioned n="07-03-1836">last Sunday</date_mentioned> with <person_mentioned>Capt. Offutt</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Melinda</person_mentioned>. —</p>

<p>By the first vessel from <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>I expect letters from <person_mentioned>Dr Franco. V.
Fernandez</person_mentioned> to whom I have written, and requested him to write me and 
explain himself "sin embozo" —y que me informe sobre su planecito a favor
de la separasion de los <location_mentioned>E. E. Y. Y.</location_mentioned> del oriente Norte y Occidente — I
promised him support on the part of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in that case. —Tell me whether
I have done right or wrong?</p>
