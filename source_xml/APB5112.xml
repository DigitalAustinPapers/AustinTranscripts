<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="01-21-1836">Jan. 21, 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. T. F. McKinney</person_mentioned></p>

<p>We, that is <person_mentioned>Archer </person_mentioned>and myself, expect certainly to leave <date_mentioned n="01-22-1836">tomorrow </date_mentioned>for
the <location_mentioned>upper country</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>W. H. Wharton</person_mentioned> started on the <date_mentioned n="01-16-1836">16</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned>—we remained to close
the business of the commission in this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>, which we have done in a very<barker_pb n="309"/>
advantageous manner, as I think, for the interests of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—we have 
effected a second loan of $50,000 for <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>at 50 cents pr. acre—some 
difference between this and the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>monclova </location_mentioned>legislature</person_mentioned> which gave <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>at about
50. dolls, pr. League— This loan produced us 40.000 dolls, prompt 
payment in hand</p>

<p>The news from <location_mentioned>all quarters</location_mentioned> is cheering and prosperous for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—
nothing is wanting but an immediate declaration of independence, and union
and harmony at <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, without this all is lost— There has been the most
perfect harmony in the <person_mentioned>commission</person_mentioned>—we all agree as to the main principles,
and especially as to independence— I hope that in future there will be
union, more so than there has been,— If there be good faith in some of
those who have been the most restless I think there will be—<person_mentioned>John Wharton
</person_mentioned>assures me that on his part, there will be no more restlessness and his
<person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>says the same— I know what reply you will make to this—but my
object is the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, our <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, it is, or ought to be the paramount object
of all, and without <hi rend="italic">union </hi>and <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi>, our <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is lost.</p>

<p>There are rumors here of disturbances at <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>, which discouraged
the <person_mentioned>friends of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> injured her credit, and caused our <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>to exult—</p>

<p>If substantial and deliberate men are elected to the <person_mentioned>convention</person_mentioned>, and 
violent <person_mentioned>demagogues </person_mentioned>are permitted to stay at home, all will go right, for such
men will legislate for <hi rend="italic">the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned></hi>, and not themselves or for a party.</p>

<p>In well organized Governments, <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>are usefull for they operate as
checks, but situated as we are in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>they are <hi rend="italic">ruinous</hi>, and ought to be
discountenanced— I have always tried to keep them down, and have been
much censured by my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>for yielding, rather than encourage party
feelings— I may have been wrong, for party spirit never gives credit to
any person for purity of motive— The situation of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is now critical,
and a great effort is necessary to establish union and harmony- The
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>ought to go <hi rend="italic">unanimously </hi>for independence. Public opinion all
over the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> expects and earnestly calls for it— Much harm has been
done heretofore by those who have endeavoured to precipitate this Measure,
by violence, partial meetings, and forestaling public opinion by manage-
ment etc. I think they are now convinced of the impropriety of this course,
and will pursue a different one, and a <hi rend="italic">rational </hi>one in future—at all events
let us all labor to promote <hi rend="italic">union </hi>and <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi>—</p>

<p>No news from <person_mentioned>W.</person_mentioned> I fear he is dreaming somewhere. God grant that his
dreams may be less injurious to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>than some which were drempt at
<location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Love to the <person_mentioned>Ladies</person_mentioned>—	<person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr T. F. McKinny</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Quintana </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Col. J. A. Wharton</person_mentioned></p>
