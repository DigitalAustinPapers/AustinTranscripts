<p><date_mentioned n="01-29-1822">29th January 1822</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I arrived here on the <date_mentioned n="01-28-1822">28th</date_mentioned> 1st. in company with <person_mentioned>H Elliot</person_mentioned> and three
young men who calculate to remain in the country if they meet with
sufficient encouragement I left home on the <date_mentioned n="12-16-1821">16th of December</date_mentioned> and
came on the <location_mentioned>Nacogdosh </location_mentioned>where I was in hopes of meeting with you
on your return from <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned>— my Journey— has been quite
tedious and <hi rend="italic">very </hi>unpleasant in some Respects which shall be 
explained in due time— When we arrived on this <location_mentioned>River</location_mentioned>— a few 
circumstances combined — induced <person_mentioned>Eliott </person_mentioned>to take a Canoe and 
proceed to the <location_mentioned>Mouth of the River</location_mentioned> in hopes of meeting with you—
which <hi rend="italic">he </hi>considers of <hi rend="italic">vast </hi>importance to you as well as himself—
the fact is he is fearful that <person_mentioned>Rob Andrews</person_mentioned> will— <hi rend="italic">by meeting with
you</hi>, blast the prospects he has of making a <hi rend="italic">princely fortune</hi>— which
he calculates on— he heard at <location_mentioned>Mount Prairie</location_mentioned> that <person_mentioned>Andrews </person_mentioned>had
started with the expectation of Surveying the Land and he has
pushed so hard— that absolutely one of his horses gave out—from
<hi rend="italic">that </hi>circumstance alone I shall remain here until I hear from you
<person_mentioned>Mr Eliott</person_mentioned> will leave his Tent and <person_mentioned>boy </person_mentioned>at this place until he either
meets with you— or gets information when he can— some 
disagreeable circumstances that have taken place on the way between
<person_mentioned>Eliott </person_mentioned>and myself Render my <hi rend="italic">situation </hi>somewhat unpleasant and I
am anxious to see you as soon as convenient I arrived at 
<location_mentioned>Herculaneum </location_mentioned>from <location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1821">October </date_mentioned>and was taken with the Fever
which continued untill within a day or two before I started—
<person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>was taken at the same time— but had recovered— partly
tho she was in low health— <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>was well and all your <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
generally—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Bartholomeu </person_mentioned>who will hand you this is a <hi rend="italic">steady</hi>— moral and
Industrious Young Man From <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Derby Connecticut</location_mentioned></hi> he is an 
excellent Cooper by trade— he was to have been on with <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned></hi>— and 
attended on him during his last Illness— I want to see you very much
and have much to say to you— when we do meet</p>
