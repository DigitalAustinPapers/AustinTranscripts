<p>Sir</p>

<p>This is an introduction quite out of all rule yet I hope you
will have the kindness to admit it—</p>

<p>The subject I would address you upon is the Manufacturing of
window Glass in your state.</p>

<p>From a Geographical view of that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>I look upon it as 
possessing advantages in the manufacturing of window glass far 
superior to any other part of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>—Amongst which its
vicinity to the <location_mentioned>lead mines</location_mentioned> is not the least—The proper sand and clay
(two articles of the first importance) I understand also may be had
very convenient—</p>

<p>Altho lead on account of the expense is not commonly used in the
making of window Glass yet where it can be procured so easily as
at your place it may be rendered very useful—The Glass will be
heavier and of finer texture and will of consequence sell more readily
in a market where there may be a competition—</p>

<p>A <location_mentioned>Glass Factory</location_mentioned> may at present (labours being with us so much
lower than usual) be erected and put in full operation with a capital
of about $4000 cash and a store of goods of 6 000—making together
Ten Thousand Dollars—</p>

<p>The cost of making Glass at these Works for a year past has been
at an average of about three dollars and sixty cents per box (fifty
feet) it is now made for $3.19 per box—Notwithstanding that a rent
of $2000 per annum is paid for the works—A friend of mine who
traveled through your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>about eighteen months ago told me
the article sold at your place then at seven dollars and fifty cents a<barker_pb n="365"/>
box—being an advance of more than one hundred per cent—A 
<location_mentioned>manufactory </location_mentioned>well managed with good <person_mentioned>workmen </person_mentioned>will produce from six
to seven hundred boxes of Glass per month—we have in two instances
at these works within a year made 800 boxes of Glass in one month—
I have here given you a correct summary of the whole work,
should any Gentlemen in your place feel disposed to embark in the
business I should be happy to engage with them and move to that
country</p>

<p>Please reply as soon as convenient</p>
