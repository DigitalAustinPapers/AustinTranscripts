<p>Sir</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>State of Texas</location_mentioned> have appointed Messrs____and myself <person_mentioned>Commissioners</person_mentioned>
for the purpose of procuring the Loan of One Million of Dollars, upon the
pledge of its resources—at an interest not Exceeding Eight per cent, for a
Term not less than 5 Years and redeemable thereafter at the pleasure of
that <location_mentioned>State </location_mentioned>at the rate of 1/5 annually—and if not so redeemed, then after
10 years redeemable wholly after six Months notice—</p>

<p>The Stock May from the first be Made likewise receivable partially in
payment of Imports—Say 1/5 on any Invoice—also in payment for Lands,
Say 1/5 from any <person_mentioned>purchaser</person_mentioned>—these provisions will create a demand that
will tend constantly to augment the current price of these securities—
The duties are now $100,000 and boldly encrease— and the <location_mentioned>Land </location_mentioned>sales
May reach $1,000,000 soon and annually—</p>

<p>By the advice of <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>I ask your consideration of this Subject and
wish you would inquire into probability of our succeeding in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>
in Making such a Loan. I am going to <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> where I shall be glad to
receive an answer from you as early [as] you shall find it practicable to
reply with any degree of precision</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Commissioners of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> propose to negociate a loan for the 
<person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, for the sum of $500,000 on the following Basis.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Commrs </person_mentioned>hold the Bonds of said <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, for the sum of $500,000
payable in 10 years at 8 per cent annual interest, which they propose to
assign to the <location_mentioned>Bank of the United States</location_mentioned> to be held in trust and as security
for the Stock to be issued for a like amount, payable in the Same Period,
and at the same rate of interest.</p>

<p>The stock shall be issued in shares of $100 each payable in 10 years
from date, with interest payable annually at 8 per cent, at such place, as
said stock shall be subscribed, said scrip shall be received also in payment
of one fifth of all monies due by the <person_mentioned>holders </person_mentioned>at the <location_mentioned>land offices of Texas</location_mentioned>,
and in payment of one fifth of all imposts due at the <location_mentioned>custom houses of
Texas</location_mentioned>, and at the end of five years the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>shall have the privilege
of redeeming one fifth of the remainder annually, and at the expiration of<barker_pb n="328"/>
10 years of redeeming the remainder (if any there be) on giving 6 months
notice.</p>

<p>Books of subscription shall be opened for said stock, and the <person_mentioned>subscribers</person_mentioned>
shall pay 25% at the time of subscription, and notes for the remainder in
three equal payments at 6, 90 and 120 days, endorsed to the satisfaction of
the <person_mentioned>Directors of the U. S. Bank</person_mentioned>, or persons appointed by them to decide,
and the <location_mentioned>Bank </location_mentioned>shall discount said notes, and pay the first payment, and the
proceeds of notes to the <person_mentioned>Commissioners</person_mentioned>.</p>
