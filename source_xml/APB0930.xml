<p>[November, 1824]</p>

<p>To <person_mentioned>Humphry Jackson</person_mentioned></p>   

<p><person_mentioned>Alcalde of the <location_mentioned>Presenct of the San Jacinto</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>

<p>Sir I enclose the commissions for you and <person_mentioned>Mr. Scott</person_mentioned>— You will
order a <person_mentioned>Muster of the men</person_mentioned> on the <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> and its waters and
make out a muster roll which you will return to me—also inspect
the arms of the men and report their number and discription I
must urge you and <person_mentioned>Mr. Scott</person_mentioned> to use your exertions and influence in
conjunction with the <person_mentioned>Alcalde </person_mentioned>to preserve harmony sobriety and
good order in the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>to effect this much may be done by
gentle and persuasive means for it is particularly the interests of
every individual in the colony to establish a character for Industry,
sobriety, and Harmony— Our future prosperity in fact in a great
degree depends on it, for if the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>discover that the few <person_mentioned>americans</person_mentioned>
who are now here cannot live together in harmony they will conclude
that if any more are admitted there will be no such thing as 
governing them and that we shall always be a troublesome and unprofitable
set of <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>, so if nothing else can restrain drunkeness and 
quarreling the personal interests of each <person_mentioned>settler </person_mentioned>ought to do it, for I
again repeat that unless we can establish a good character with the
Govt. we shall never prosper—  </p>
