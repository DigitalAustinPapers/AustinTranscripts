<p><location_mentioned>St. Genevieve </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="08-17-1807">17 Aug. 1807.</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My deae Sir :</p>

<p>It is now past the <date_mentioned n="08-17-1807">middle of August</date_mentioned> and definite arrangement
is not made about my <person_mentioned>Families </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Horace Austin</person_mentioned> etc coming on
I feel anxious about it— They certainly ought to leave <location_mentioned>New Haven</location_mentioned>
at farthest the <date_mentioned n="10-20-1807">20. Octr.</date_mentioned> I have written them to that effect—I have
Proposed to have a Carriage and four Horses proceed to bring on all
the <person_mentioned>women </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Children </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Horace Austin</person_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>Pittsburgh </location_mentioned>and to
furnish <person_mentioned>Horace </person_mentioned>with $200 to pay their expenses, what Articles of
Furnature etc which are to come on, to be sent to <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> to come
with <person_mentioned>Austin Eliott </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Wheling</location_mentioned>, which I think will be far preferable
than going to <location_mentioned>Pittsburgh</location_mentioned>—I have also written them, you will meet
those at <location_mentioned>Pittsg </location_mentioned>Procure Boats etc and meet <person_mentioned>Eliott </person_mentioned>at Wheeling this
arrangement appears to me to be by far the most Preferable—
nevertheless, I wish to know whether it meets your approbation and
whether you will on your part put it in execution and when you will
probably go on yourself. I am told <person_mentioned>Mr. Spencer</person_mentioned> don't think <person_mentioned>Eliott</person_mentioned>
will be able to return before <date_mentioned n="Spring-1808">next Spring</date_mentioned>—this would derange my
plans and expectations very much as of course <person_mentioned>Mr. Spencer</person_mentioned> don't
expect to be in <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> before <date_mentioned n="Fall-1806">late in the fall</date_mentioned>— Therefore, if you
really expect <person_mentioned>Elliott </person_mentioned>on this <date_mentioned n="Fall-1806">fall</date_mentioned>, had you not better get a [letter]
from <person_mentioned>Spencer </person_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Mr. Corp</person_mentioned> and forward on immediately to <person_mentioned>Eliott</person_mentioned>—
there is no probability of <person_mentioned>Spencer</person_mentioned>s being there before they must
come away, if they come before <date_mentioned n="Spring-1807">next Spring</date_mentioned>—I wish you would write
me by the first Opportunity and send the necessary letters to be 
forwarded as you must calculate at least 6 Weeks in their getting to
<location_mentioned>N Haven</location_mentioned>, after they leave here.—I am glad to hear, by <person_mentioned>Judge
Shrader</person_mentioned>, that the hay-making Business ended so well—only Exercise
patience and forbareance for a little time and I have no doubt all
things will work well in this Land of contention and discord— I
was sorry to find you so little disposed to lend a sheltering hand
to our proposed <location_mentioned>Academy</location_mentioned>—I am sure the <person_mentioned>Judge </person_mentioned>must applied to
you, when in one of your Gloomy and desponding Moments—When
you awake to the importance of such an Institution, to the welfare
of this <location_mentioned>Territory </location_mentioned>and to the young and rising generation, it will
draw from you your wonted and liberal aide I should feel hurt
not to see your name to that Subscription— I must confess I 
expected more than $10. from our friend <person_mentioned>James Austin</person_mentioned>, I think when
he reflects that he has [a gro]wing <person_mentioned>Family</person_mentioned>, who will partake of the
benefits arising from such an Institution, it will draw from him an
additional Subscription—I feel deeply interested in having the thing<barker_pb n="184"/>
go into effect—but unless we can obtain in the <location_mentioned>Territory </location_mentioned>at least
$4000 by subscription the thing must be abandoned—<person_mentioned>Friends </person_mentioned>here
are all well-—give my Respects to all <person_mentioned>Friends</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>T. Phelps</person_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Moses Austin Esqr. Merchant</person_mentioned><location_mentioned> Mine A. Burton</location_mentioned> By
<person_mentioned>Mr. Hull</person_mentioned>—</p>
