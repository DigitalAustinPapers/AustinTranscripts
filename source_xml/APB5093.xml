<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Henry</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Mr Ware</person_mentioned> is not in the <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>—he is some where in the <location_mentioned>state
of Mississippi</location_mentioned>— I will leave your letter for him with <person_mentioned>Mr A. Hodge 
president of the <location_mentioned>Orleans Bank</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— There is great enthusiasm in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in
this <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>, and <location_mentioned>all over the U. S</location_mentioned>.—a thousand fold more than I had any idea
of— The universal opinion seems to be that, we ought to declare 
Independence <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>—it will give us the aid of <person_mentioned>men of capital and high
standing and character</person_mentioned> who wish for a more extensive field, than a mere
party war in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— My own feelings and impulses inclined me to this
course long ago and especially when I left <location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned>— What I said to
the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt</person_mentioned>, on the <date_mentioned n="11-30-1835">30th. November</date_mentioned> and <date_mentioned n="12-02-1835">2d December</date_mentioned> indicates
my feelings plain enough— It was unfortunate that I came on by water—
I should have arrived sooner by land, and I could not have gone to the
<location_mentioned>lower country</location_mentioned>, where the warm and even violent feelings of some of my
<person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>did at that time to a certain extent prcipitate me into party 
<hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>—a thing I have always tryed to avoid—</p>

<p>I am now acting and in future shall act on my own impulses, for I have
generally found them to be correct— <hi rend="italic">I go for Independence</hi> for I have no
doubt we shall get aid, as much as we need and perhaps more—and what
is of equal importance—the information from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>up to late in 
<date_mentioned n="12-xx-1835">December </date_mentioned>says that the <person_mentioned>Federal party</person_mentioned> has united with <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> against us,
owing to what has already been said and done in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in favor of 
Independence so that our present position under the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1834">1824</date_mentioned>, does
us no good with the <person_mentioned>Federalists</person_mentioned>, and is doing us harm in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, by
keeping away the kind of men we most need— were I in the <location_mentioned>convention </location_mentioned>I
would urge an immediate declaration of Independence—unless there should
be some news from the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>that changed the face of things—and even
then, it would require very strong reasons to prevent me from the course I<barker_pb n="298"/>
now recommend— I wish you to inform <person_mentioned>McKinny </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Jack </person_mentioned>etc of the 
contents of this letter—that is of such parts of it as you think proper—and I
advise you to take an open and bold stand for Independence at once— I
hope all my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>will do the same—and that the Question will be 
decided <hi rend="italic">unanimously</hi>— as I before observed I am informed that the <person_mentioned>Federal
Party</person_mentioned> have done nothing for us—and will do nothing—if so it is a folly to
maintain our present position any longer—</p>
