<p>To the <person_mentioned>People of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Arriving this day from <location_mentioned>Monterray </location_mentioned>the <location_mentioned>capitol of the state of of New
Leon</location_mentioned>, which place I left on the <date_mentioned n="08-10-1835">10th inst</date_mentioned>. and being requested by the
<person_mentioned>Chairman of the Committee of Safety and Correspondence for the 
jurisdiction of <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, to detail the information which I possess in regard to
the designs of the <person_mentioned>Mexican Government</person_mentioned> towards the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>,
I make the following communication, for the truth of which I stake my
reputation, and appeal to time to establish every fact herein stated: I left<barker_pb n="108"/>
the <location_mentioned>state of New Leon</location_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="08-10-1835">10th of this month</date_mentioned> with a request from our
<person_mentioned>republican friends</person_mentioned> to say to the <person_mentioned>citizens of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> that our only hopes of
<hi rend="italic">future liberty and security depended upon our immediately</hi> taking steps
to oppose the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>in their establishing a <person_mentioned>Central Government</person_mentioned> or an
arbitrary despotism which is without doubt their intention.</p>

<p>I have been for the last few years a close <person_mentioned>observer </person_mentioned>of their movements
respecting <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I have frequently conversed with their <person_mentioned>principal men,
Civil, Military and Ecclesiastical</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I may say almost daily for years, and particularly since the downfall of
<location_mentioned>Zaccatecas</location_mentioned>, about their intention toward <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and I can assure you that
this is their intention; first, to move large numbers of <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>, at least
thousands to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, for the purpose of being at hand when the change of
Government takes place, which change is intended for next month; 2d.
to establish their <location_mentioned>posts </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Custom houses</location_mentioned>; 3d. Using their own language
to burn the <location_mentioned>houses </location_mentioned>and drive from the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>a number of our <person_mentioned>principal
citizens</person_mentioned> which they have, and have had on a list for a year past, principally
those that were engaged with the <person_mentioned>soldiers </person_mentioned>three years since; 4th. put their
<person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned>free and let them loose upon their <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, as they express 
themselves; and 5th- call up the <person_mentioned>empresarios </person_mentioned>and demand of them their colonizing
contracts with the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, and say to them you are here authorised
to settle so many <person_mentioned>hundred families</person_mentioned>, instead of which you have settled
thousands of <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>.—I replied to them that there had been decrees of
Government permitting emigration of <person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>and the sale of <location_mentioned>lands</location_mentioned>
to which they say that these decrees emanated alone from the government
from or through the intrigue of <person_mentioned>Empresarios </person_mentioned>or the all powerful influence
of a few doubloons; and that these <location_mentioned>lands </location_mentioned>must be given up for their own
<person_mentioned>natives</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have seen <person_mentioned>Gentlemen from different parts of the Government</person_mentioned>, 
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>responsable Gentlemen</person_mentioned></hi>, all <person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>who passed <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>on every <location_mentioned>road </location_mentioned>Marching
for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>; one Gentleman from <hi rend="italic">Mexico </hi>told me that the complaints from
<location_mentioned>different sections of the Country</location_mentioned> to <person_mentioned>Foreign Ministers</person_mentioned> have lately been so
loud and numerous, together with a late attempt to rob the <person_mentioned>foreigners</person_mentioned>—
and some insults given to a British armed vessel off <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>, by the
<person_mentioned>officers of the <location_mentioned>Castle</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> would, as he was told by the <person_mentioned>English Minister Mister
Packingham</person_mentioned> bring down a declaration of war upon them by the <person_mentioned>British
Government</person_mentioned>. These facts with the outrageous conduct of the <person_mentioned>Commandant
now at <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned> (Col. Condey)</person_mentioned> calls loudly for immediate steps to
be taken for our preservation. These facts are stated by request and for
the benefit of the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. I pledge my life and honor that these
Statements are correct.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Horatio A. Alsberry</person_mentioned>.</p>
