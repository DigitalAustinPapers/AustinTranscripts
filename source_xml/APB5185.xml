<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Sousin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I have yours from <location_mentioned>Maysville</location_mentioned>, and hope this will be in time to meet you
at <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>. If you want <hi rend="italic">men </hi>it seems to me all important that you
should Come here forth with. 4 or <person_mentioned>500 men</person_mentioned> are nearly ready and anxious
to go, but neither <person_mentioned>Col: Lewis</person_mentioned>, nor <person_mentioned>Col: Wilson</person_mentioned> has yet arrived— great
discontent and want of Confidence prevail—some have gone off in disgust—
others will follow without some efficient Movement— Your presence would
reanimate them. The greatest enthusiasm did exist, but the want of a head<barker_pb n="362"/>
is manifest. <person_mentioned>Col Lewis</person_mentioned> has been sick in <location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned>—did not write for a
long time—and now a letter says he will go <location_mentioned>Eastward </location_mentioned>without Coming
here—much disappointment on account of it. <person_mentioned>Col: Wilson</person_mentioned> went to make
arrangements for his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—was expected back a week ago—not a word
from him—it is thought he is sick—the bad weather hinders every thing
and every body. <hi rend="italic">A fine <person_mentioned>Company</person_mentioned></hi> in <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Bourbon </hi>county</location_mentioned> want to go, but there
is no one <hi rend="italic">with authority</hi> to encourage them to do so. Your presence would
do all in an instant. <person_mentioned>Capt Postlewhaite</person_mentioned> takes the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Fayette </hi>Company—Ladies
<hi rend="italic">Legion</hi></person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>200</person_mentioned> are in <location_mentioned>barracks </location_mentioned>here since some weeks—others are joining—
while some go off. There is Much Confusion. Enthusiasm Could instantly
be kindled— Young <person_mentioned>Woolley</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Gause</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Rogers</person_mentioned>, and others are first rate
young men—all enthusiasm, but somewhat depressed from the above
Causes.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Miss James</person_mentioned> has painted your flag on silk—Sun Washington and all—it
is beautiful—it is to be presented by <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Henrietta</person_mentioned></hi>—with an appropriate speech
written for her <hi rend="italic">by myself</hi>— <date_mentioned n="06-03-1836">Friday afternoon</date_mentioned>— How interesting to have
you here! It is to be in <person_mentioned>Mrs Hart</person_mentioned>s lawn. We tried to have it to day but
the weather has been so bad Could not be got dry. and it rains fast—
All the <person_mentioned>Military </person_mentioned>were to parade. We tried to hurry it because some of the
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>are to start <hi rend="italic"><date_mentioned n="06-02-1836">tomorrow </date_mentioned></hi>in the Car— There is an <location_mentioned>encampment </location_mentioned>and 
<location_mentioned>rendezvous </location_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Shelbyville</location_mentioned>—another is in <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>—some have gone on
there— A Letter is here from <person_mentioned>Col: Harrison of <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to <person_mentioned>Col: Wilson
</person_mentioned>wanting information about starting etc there is no one here to give it.
<person_mentioned>Mr. Ficklin</person_mentioned> was in here just now—is trying hard to get them off—thinks it
all important that they go quick or they will not go at all— <person_mentioned>Mr. Bryant
</person_mentioned>followed—thinks your Coming for a single day, if you Could spare it—
would be <hi rend="italic">effectual</hi>. They and <person_mentioned>Mr. Hunt</person_mentioned> make great exertions, as does
<person_mentioned>Gen McCalla</person_mentioned> and others. <person_mentioned>Dr Dudley</person_mentioned> opposes all he can, as does <person_mentioned>Mr
Wickliffe</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I think with you about <person_mentioned>monied men</person_mentioned>. It is my experience. We must not
look to them for generosity. None of them have come forward here except
<person_mentioned>Mr Norton</person_mentioned> who gave $100— As to our <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>money matters— I see no
hope in any quarter—so must e'en put my shoulder to the wheel a little
longer I shall do it cheerfully in <hi rend="italic">view of the end</hi>. I have another <person_mentioned>boarder</person_mentioned>
and can have enough. Perhaps you did not get my last letter to 
<location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>. I wrote you I have taken <location_mentioned>the house adjoining mine</location_mentioned>, making with that
room enough. If your <person_mentioned>sister</person_mentioned>, in view of placing her <person_mentioned>daughter </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>school </location_mentioned>(at
<location_mentioned><person_mentioned>mr Leacock</person_mentioned>'s</location_mentioned>, a very good one) I should be glad to have her pass the 
<date_mentioned n="Summer-1836">summer </date_mentioned>with me and her <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>or any [others] of our <person_mentioned>Texan friends</person_mentioned>— I wrote
<person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>to that effect. He is still in <location_mentioned>N. 0.</location_mentioned> trying for funds. <person_mentioned>Mr Erwin</person_mentioned> has
made already $50,000 by <location_mentioned>Texas lands</location_mentioned>, he has gone out to [illegible]-—
while we lose all we have without realizing a cent. Our time will come—I<barker_pb n="363"/>
hope— <person_mentioned>Bradford </person_mentioned>from <person_mentioned>Fannings Corps</person_mentioned> arrived here <date_mentioned n="05-31-1836">last night</date_mentioned>—have not
seen him, If you have the New Constitution of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>please send or bring
it without delay— Am closing the last chapter—terrible struggle to get the
book out. We have a grand Close—with <person_mentioned>Houston</person_mentioned>s proclamation. <person_mentioned>Dr
Overton of <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is here. I have a parcel of clothes made up by us for
the <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>—Dont know what to do with them— No proper authority to 
receive them. I furnished the silk for the flag—<person_mentioned>Gen: McCalla</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Staff </person_mentioned>and
spear head. I have expended about $30 of my own funds for work and
materials besides what we have done and what has been given. I have not
a doubt but all will be well.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>M A H [Mary Austin Holley.]</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Charlton Hunt</person_mentioned> gave $100 and a horse to <person_mentioned>Col: Wilson</person_mentioned>. And was
very active here and elsewhere. Since writing—It has been suggested that
at the presentation of the Flag in <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mrs Hart</person_mentioned>s lawn</location_mentioned>—you being present to
make a speech—1000$ or more might be collected You had better come.
<person_mentioned>Gen: McCalla</person_mentioned> just came in—says come by all means. What a pity you did
not come from, <location_mentioned>Maysville</location_mentioned>. he has written by this mail—</p>

<p>About coming here, I have endeavored to spread out the matter before
you— You must judge. A <person_mentioned>gentleman of family </person_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Herrodsburgh </location_mentioned>brought
his <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned>, a youth of 17 to put him under the especial care of some <person_mentioned>officer</person_mentioned>—
as he <hi rend="italic">would go.</hi> Young men and boys can hardly be restrained from 
going—they run away from their <person_mentioned>parents </person_mentioned>when they will not consent.
