<p>Sir,</p>

<p>A meeting of the <person_mentioned>people of this place</person_mentioned>, with a number of very respectable
<person_mentioned>citizens of the <location_mentioned>surrounding country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, was called this day, to adopt the most
appropriate measures for welcoming you to your <location_mentioned>adopted country</location_mentioned> and to
the bosom of your <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>for this purpose, the undersigned,
a <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>appointed by the meeting to carry their wishes into effect;
have dispatched <person_mentioned>Mr. J Borden</person_mentioned> one of their body to wait upon you, and
request you to have the goodness to inform them, at what time it will suit
your convenience, to meet them at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Capt Alien</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned>, to the end that they may
have the honor of accompanying you into the town of<location_mentioned> San Felipe</location_mentioned>, where
you will meet many of your long established <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, all prepared to receive
you with open arms and with acclamations of Joy.</p>

<p>We tender to you our respect and most exalted consideration.</p>

<p>[note]</p>

<p>The sentiment of congratulation expressed by the <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>appointed
by the <person_mentioned>citizens of the <location_mentioned>municipality of Austin</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> was responded to by all the
<person_mentioned>people of whatever party</person_mentioned> throughout the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. This meeting as well
as those held at <location_mentioned>Brazoria</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>and other places, can but faintly
express at this day, the feelings of Joy and pleasure on the return of <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>.
They looked upon the event as one which would settle all their doubts as
to what should be done, and as one which would, as it proved, unite all
<person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>of which the <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>was composed.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Peach Point</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="02-06-1844">6th Feby 1844</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>G. Borden, Jr</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[note]</p>

<p>As evidence of the feeling which prevailed, we need only have recourse
to the many congratulatory letters written to him from <location_mentioned>all parts of the
country</location_mentioned> from the <person_mentioned>best and most distinguished citizens</person_mentioned>. Even his <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>
and some who had threatened in his absence to brand him with infamy
were constrained to greet him as the only physician that could correct the
disorganized system and restore a healthy action to the body corporate.</p>

<p>The entire confidence which <person_mentioned>all parties</person_mentioned> had in <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>'s superior 
knowledge in whatever related to the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, his zeal and untiring perseverance
to promote its interest, and his integrity and virtue were sufficient reasons for
the influence which his return was calculated to produce upon the 
<person_mentioned>community</person_mentioned>. The question may have occurred to those unacquainted with the
peculiar situation of the country at that time, Why was not <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>placed
at the head of the <person_mentioned>provisional government</person_mentioned>? Because the disorganized and
unsettled condition of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>required his action in another sphere.
His extensive correspondence and presence among the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>exerted a far
greater influence than he could have done at the head of a government little
more than nominal. This may be inferred from the earnest and general
solicitation of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>that he should take command of the first army.
They said "his presence in the field will inspire a confidence in the 
hazardous enterprize."</p>

<p>Again when it was thought necessary to send <person_mentioned>commissioners </person_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>United
States</location_mentioned>, who but <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>could better head the mission which, was intended
to lay before that <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>the true grounds of the contest, and thereby,
interest them in our favor? It is unnecessary to speak of the importance
of this mission. <person_mentioned>Twenty-five or Thirty thousand people</person_mentioned> without any 
preparations for war without resources contending against <person_mentioned>Eight millions</person_mentioned>.
If a <person_mentioned>Frankland [Franklin]</person_mentioned> was called upon to interest the <location_mentioned>European nations</location_mentioned>
in behalf of the <location_mentioned>thirteen colonies</location_mentioned>, who in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>more suitable than <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned><barker_pb n="114"/>
to be entrusted with the important mission. The administration of 
government could be intrusted to others. But it must not be supposed that <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>
withheld his aid in directing the Executive and legislative operations of the
country: His opinions were asked for and sought by those departments,
and the numerous communications made by him to the <person_mentioned>provisional 
government</person_mentioned> on every subject touching the welfare of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>prove how much
the administration of affairs was indebted to his experience judgement
and skill.</p>

<p>Those acquainted with the condition of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>at the time, knew
and appreciated the influence which he exerted as <person_mentioned>Secretary of State</person_mentioned> under
the first organization under the constitution, and which office he accepted
at the earnest solicitation of men who were convinced of his preeminent
abilities in negociating a connection with the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> which was so
much desired at the time. It should be remarked that the <person_mentioned>friends of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
looked upon <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>as the man best qualified to bring about the annexation
to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>, a measure to which he lent all his energies and which
was the occasion of his death.</p>
