<p>My dear <person_mentioned>Cousin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. Lewis</person_mentioned> tells me he leaves <date_mentioned n="07-30-1836">in the morning</date_mentioned> on his return, and offering
to take letters. I will not omit so good an opportunity to write. I only
received yours from <location_mentioned>Baltimore </location_mentioned>advising of your being then on your way to
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. Where we since learn, through the <location_mentioned>papers </location_mentioned>of your safe arrival, and
should be pleased to hear from under your own hand of the State in which
you find the affairs of the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>. So Contradictory are the accounts that
reach us. All however agree that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has More to fear from internal
dissensions, or want of harmony than from the <person_mentioned>Mexicans</person_mentioned>. I however trust
all will work right in the End— If we can Credit the accounts of late
Very Cruz Packet, there is no truth in the late reported March of a Strong
force against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. A <person_mentioned>Passenger </person_mentioned>States he saw a person just before sailing
direct from the <person_mentioned>Mexican army at <location_mentioned>Matamoras</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—only Eleven days—left
there—<date_mentioned n="06-22-1836">22d June</date_mentioned>, at which time <person_mentioned>Urrea </person_mentioned>was still there. And said person
gave it as his opinion that the <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>would not again Enter <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.—
One of <person_mentioned>Fannin</person_mentioned>gs Men Came <person_mentioned>passenger </person_mentioned>in above Packet.— <person_mentioned>Joseph H. 
Sophan</person_mentioned>, a native of <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>—and gives a horrid picture of the Massacre<barker_pb n="408"/>
of <person_mentioned>Fanning and his Men</person_mentioned>. The particulars as given by him were published
in last <location_mentioned>Evenings Star</location_mentioned>. I sent you a paper in todays Mail Care <person_mentioned>Mr Bryan</person_mentioned>.
I also enclose the Statement Cut from the <location_mentioned>paper</location_mentioned>. It Should be translated
into Spanish for the special benifit of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> and his <person_mentioned>officers</person_mentioned>, for if
they have any feelings, which we must very much doubt that they have of
humanity—This bloody affair as related by <person_mentioned>Sophan </person_mentioned>is Enough to Make
their hearts Sicken and give them little hope of Mercy at the hands of the
<person_mentioned>Texians</person_mentioned>, but a proof that too much has already been shown them.—The
Packet brings dates from the <person_mentioned>City of Mexico</person_mentioned> to <date_mentioned n="06-26-1836">26th June</date_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>
to <date_mentioned n="07-01-1836">1st July</date_mentioned>, At which time there does not appear any revolutionary 
Movements to any Extent, but from private—letters was hourly looked for. I
will cut out of the papers and Enclose such news as I think will interest
you. I also forward you files of papers Via <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>. Some of Which
