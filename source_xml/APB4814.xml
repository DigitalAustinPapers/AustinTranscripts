<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Johnson</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I hope you spent the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1835">4th July</date_mentioned> pleasantly with your <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>who feel
some reverence for the day. As to myself, I can not say I enjoyed it. I
got a bottle of vino muscale and drank to the <hi rend="italic">Federal Constitution in all
parts of <location_mentioned>America</location_mentioned>.</hi> I had no <person_mentioned>countrymen </person_mentioned>to join me or perhaps I should
have done better.</p>

<p>We left <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="05-29-1835">29 of May</date_mentioned>, and were taken <person_mentioned>prisoners </person_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="06-05-1835">5th
of June</date_mentioned>, at night, after we had encamped about <location_mentioned>eight leagues northwest of
San Fernando</location_mentioned>. The <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>had been viewing our march for the last day,
and knew the only chance we had for water and placed themselves in a
situation to take possession of our horses as soon as it was dusk. In this
situation we were obliged to surrender to <person_mentioned>twenty five men</person_mentioned>—or <person_mentioned>savages </person_mentioned>as
we may more properly call them. <person_mentioned>Capt Galan</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Liut: Roderiguiz 
[Rodriguez]</person_mentioned> commanded the party. They will be long remembered by your
humble servant.</p>

<p>We were taken to <location_mentioned>San Fernando</location_mentioned> and kept in close <location_mentioned>confinement </location_mentioned>for one
week—not permitted to write or speak to any person except in the presence
of an <person_mentioned>officer</person_mentioned>, and then but in the Spanish language. From there we were
taken to <location_mentioned>Rio Grande</location_mentioned>, where we were treated something better by <person_mentioned>Capt
Barigan</person_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>Rio Grande</location_mentioned> to this place. At present we are under the
charge of <person_mentioned>Col: Altapa</person_mentioned>, who is a 
<person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>and an <person_mentioned>officer</person_mentioned>, and gives every
indulgence we ask for. From here we expect to be sent to <location_mentioned>Monterey </location_mentioned>to
stand our trial, and I hope to be set at liberty. But all is uncertainty.
The whole of this part of the state has and will support the <person_mentioned>Central
Government</person_mentioned>. The <location_mentioned>Interior </location_mentioned>from the last information we have, has fallen
into the Central system, <person_mentioned>Santanna </person_mentioned>is <person_mentioned>Dictator</person_mentioned>—the Constitution is thrown
away and ridiculed by those who used to call themselves <person_mentioned>Federal 
Republicans</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The plan for the dissolution and destruction is laid, and every 
preparation is making for its execution. In the last ten days <person_mentioned>two hundred troops</person_mentioned>
have left <location_mentioned>this quarter</location_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>; and from the test information I
can collect <person_mentioned>two thousand more</person_mentioned> will be on their march in a few weeks.
Their intention is to gain the friendship of the <person_mentioned>different tribes of Indians</person_mentioned>;<barker_pb n="83"/>
and, if possible to get the <person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned>to revolt. These plans of barbarity and
injustice will make a wilderness of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and beggars of its <person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>,
if they do not unite and act with promptitude and decision. If the Federal
system is lost in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, what will be our situation? worse than that of
the most degraded <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned>. The hopes of the <person_mentioned>Republican party</person_mentioned> here are all
on <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I trust they will not be deceived. The <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will
never submit to a <person_mentioned>Dictator</person_mentioned>.</p>
