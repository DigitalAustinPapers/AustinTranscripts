<p>Sir</p>

<p>as Respects this affair of <person_mentioned>Peter Whitaker</person_mentioned> the Evidence against him
is very positive and I am fearfull that they are altogether a bad set
my oppinion of the Matter is that <person_mentioned>Gibbons </person_mentioned>is very much of a <person_mentioned>thief</person_mentioned>
and has perhaps been the cause of those young men getting into
these bad habits he is their <person_mentioned>Step Father</person_mentioned> and has partly Raised them
this young man <person_mentioned>Peter Whitaker</person_mentioned> has the appearance of an Innocent
young man and appears much mortified—for my own part I feel
much disposed to pity the young man tho I believe he has done Rong
an order for the whole of them to leave the country Immediately
perhaps would be the shortest way of Ending the Trouble he the
sd <person_mentioned>Whitaker </person_mentioned>first paying all cost and charges before he should be
Released</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jno. P. Coles</person_mentioned></p>

Horses that were said to have been stolen tho the theft of the
Horses were not proven I have not found out the <person_mentioned>Spaniard </person_mentioned>name

there is an old Rifle Gun left Here that was taken from a <person_mentioned>duchman</person_mentioned>
by <person_mentioned>Gibbons </person_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>duchman</person_mentioned>s name not Known you will direct me what
to do with this property the Horses and Gun</p>

<p>as also State to me wheather <person_mentioned>Gibbons </person_mentioned>property can be taken to pay
for three Hogs that were stolen.</p>
