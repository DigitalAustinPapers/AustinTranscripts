oclock they took up their march and encamped about <location_mentioned>seven miles above
this place</location_mentioned> in a very strong position, suspecting that their object in this
movement was either to wait for a <person_mentioned>reinforcement</person_mentioned>, from <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>, or
to cross <location_mentioned>at the upper crossing, about 15 Miles above</location_mentioned>, it was determined to
attack them, before their plan could be carried into execution—Accordingly
