<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Cousin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>We had an overflowing Meeting <date_mentioned n="04-20-1836">last night</date_mentioned>, adjourned from the Morning,
when they merely organized, the <person_mentioned>Whig Convention</person_mentioned> being in session. I made
up a <person_mentioned>party of ladies</person_mentioned> and we all went, and never was I so complimented—
never so proud. And who do you think was the <person_mentioned>orator</person_mentioned>? The <person_mentioned>new 
Commissioner from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>Col: Lewis</person_mentioned>. It so happened—a lucky coincidence
<hi rend="italic">for once</hi>—that he arrived from <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>—(where he told us they had a
very enthusiastic Meeting)—in the afternoon. <person_mentioned>Mr. Higgins</person_mentioned>, the old 
<person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>they went to see, was in the chair. <person_mentioned>Mr. Bryant</person_mentioned> mentioned the arrival of
<person_mentioned>Col. Lewis</person_mentioned> and moved that a Committee be appointed to call on him—
invite him to attend the meeting. He came accordingly his presence gave
great spirit to the occasion. He addressed the audience and gave a clear
exposition of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>affairs. Perfect silence and attention prevailed. He
occupied all the time. Several <person_mentioned>gentlemen </person_mentioned>were prepared to speak. Among
them <person_mentioned>Mr Wiggington of <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>to him who started <date_mentioned n="04-19-1836">two days
since</date_mentioned> with his <person_mentioned>company of volunteers</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mr Bradford</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr Ferguson</person_mentioned>, and
<person_mentioned>Gen: McCauley</person_mentioned> meant also to address the house. Some excellent 
resolutions and a memorial to <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, prepared by <person_mentioned>Mr. Martin</person_mentioned>, passed 
unanimously and with great applause. Never was anything done with more
unanimity—more harmony. An <person_mentioned>Irish Catholic</person_mentioned> attempted to make some
objections on the ground of Committing the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>etc; and was instantly
hissed and hooted down—with take him out—take him out etc. <person_mentioned>Col: Lewis</person_mentioned>
was presented to me at the close and I attempted to thank him for his fine
Compliments. I expected him here <date_mentioned n="04-21-1836">this Morning</date_mentioned>, but learn he is occupied
with <person_mentioned>visitors</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Gen: McCauley</person_mentioned> just called, says they will have another
meeting <date_mentioned n="04-21-1836">to night</date_mentioned> to obtain subscriptions, a chance for <hi rend="italic">their cut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dried
speeches</hi>. You see we are doing well. There is great spirit now. You
began it,—by a little here and there we have kept it up, and <person_mentioned>Col: Lewis</person_mentioned><barker_pb n="336"/>
has fixed the matter. I find you get news from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>within two days as
soon as we do. I hope anxiously for something encouraging.</p>

<p>I had liked to have made a speech myself <date_mentioned n="04-20-1836">last night</date_mentioned>. What a theme it
is for eloquence. <person_mentioned>Col: Lewis</person_mentioned> appealed to my testimony as to the character
of the <person_mentioned>Texians</person_mentioned>, in reply to some slanders—and with effect if these people
have any pride. I almost rose from my seat to say that it was my proud
distinction to be able to testify to the truth etc.</p>

<p>The Mail closes— Love to all <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>[s] Let them Have your portrait
to be lithographed.</p>
