<p>Copy of a letter from <person_mentioned>Col S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> to<person_mentioned> P. W. Grayson</person_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned>,
dated <date_mentioned n="09-19-1835">Sep. 19th 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir. The final answer of <person_mentioned>Gen Cos</person_mentioned> has just been recd— It is positive
that the <person_mentioned>persons who have been demanded</person_mentioned> shall be given up—and that the
<person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> must unconditionally submit—to any reforms or 
lterations that <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>has to make in the Constitution— I give you the 
substance, which is that we have no rights except what the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>think proper
to grant us as a favour.</p>

<p>Can or will the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> submit to this! According to the position
already taken by them they cannot.—</p>

<p>War then is <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi>— It is impossible to avoid it— This is my
opinion and I have therefore issued the <location_mentioned>circular </location_mentioned>from the <person_mentioned>committee of
this place</person_mentioned> which goes below by this opportunity I have written to <person_mentioned>Hall</person_mentioned>,
and advised the raising of a <person_mentioned>Volunteer Corps</person_mentioned>, to be ready for immediate
opperations— I think he could raise such a <person_mentioned>corps</person_mentioned>— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>now needs
the <person_mentioned>united councils</person_mentioned> and cooperation of every man <hi rend="italic">in </hi>it— <person_mentioned>War and peace
parties</person_mentioned> are at an end— There is no remedy but to fight— I shall send
to <location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>A <person_mentioned>Gentleman </person_mentioned>writes from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>that the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>will be invaded whether
the obnoxious individuals, (the <person_mentioned>persons demanded by Ugartechea</person_mentioned>) are
given up or not, and the land business and everything else is to be regulated
by the <person_mentioned>military</person_mentioned>. and he says the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>must make up their minds either
to submit or prepare for defence.</p>

<p>I place more reliance on what he says because he has made so many
exertions to effect an amicable reconciliation. He also says that he will
stay and see <hi rend="italic">Cos</hi>. though he has no hopes of doing any thing—</p>

<p>I think he has been faithful to the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>here and fear he will get into
<location_mentioned>prison</location_mentioned></p>—<barker_pb n="128"/>

<p>Now my friend tell me what we can do except to fight— an attempt
at reconciliation has been made and failed, and the <person_mentioned>agents </person_mentioned>(for <person_mentioned>Barrett</person_mentioned>
who has returned says the same thing— who were sent, say that we must
submit or fight— Is the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>or any <person_mentioned>man </person_mentioned>in it ready or willing to
submit to a <person_mentioned>Military Despot</person_mentioned>.— I think not and for this reason I thought
it was my duty to let the people know their true situation, as I done in the
<location_mentioned>Circular</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Give me your opinion and that of the <person_mentioned>people <location_mentioned>in that quarter</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>These things have come on us much sooner than I expected when I left
<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> but there is no remedy that I see— <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>has 
precipitated them— Two <person_mentioned>Regiments</person_mentioned> it is said are ordered on from <location_mentioned>San Luis</location_mentioned>, and
also the <person_mentioned>Campeachy Troops</person_mentioned>— So says our <person_mentioned>informant </person_mentioned>who heard it in
<location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></p>
