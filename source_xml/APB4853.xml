<p>[From the Williams Papers. Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas.]</p>
<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="09-22-1835">Augt 22d 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Since you left I have heard, by way of <location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned>, that matters are
getting on pritty well, in our <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, considerable excitement tho. not
more than might be reasonably expected under the circumstances of the
times— Everything depends on a great emigration this <date_mentioned n="Fall-1835">fall </date_mentioned>and <date_mentioned n="Winter-1835">winter</date_mentioned>—
remember this— The <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> folks </person_mentioned>have much at stake, and ought to
exert themselves to send out <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>without delay— their best plan is to
send an <person_mentioned>agent</person_mentioned>, or to operate by means of<person_mentioned> influential men</person_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>Western
Country</location_mentioned>— The plan of sending out <person_mentioned>irish </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>german redemtioners</person_mentioned> is a
bad one—it will not do— you know the kind of <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>needed in
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— We need efficient and <person_mentioned>active and intelligent men</person_mentioned> who will take
character and means to the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— Much, and perhaps all, may depend
on the emigration this <date_mentioned n="Fall-1835">fall </date_mentioned>and <date_mentioned n="Winter-1835">winter</date_mentioned>—</p><barker_pb n="105"/>

<p>I wish to take a large interest in the <location_mentioned>bank</location_mentioned>, as I told you— This we will
arrange when you return— Keep in view that that measure cannot succeed
well unless many of the <person_mentioned>farmers </person_mentioned>etc in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are interested— Do not
fail to call on <person_mentioned>Mr. Learning</person_mentioned>, and my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned>, and be very
prudent as to everything. The vessel goes tomorrow— remember me to
<person_mentioned>White</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I was told confidentially to day that a letter had been written to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
from here (I know not by whom but guess) stating that I was a blind
<person_mentioned>agent of Santana</person_mentioned>'s etc. The object of certain persons, as you know, is to
try and make tools of the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to build up themselves— <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
ought to act on the defensive and not be the tools of either of the <person_mentioned>political
parties of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— She has just as much to expect from one <person_mentioned>party</person_mentioned>, as
from the other, and no more from one than from the other— She must
rely upon herself, and to do so, she needs strength— emigration gives us
strength and everything.</p>
