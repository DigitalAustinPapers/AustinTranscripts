<p>Dr. <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>, I fully expected to have been on my way <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>before this.
I am however still on bail and cannot leave until the amnesty law is 
published and when that will be is uncertain. It was sent to the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>
<date_mentioned n="03-09-1835">yesterday</date_mentioned>, and it is said that he will send it back to <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>to be altered.
If so it may be a month before it finally becomes a law. Inform <person_mentioned>Grayson</person_mentioned>
of this—he will be surpised for when he left we both calculated the law
would be published in a few days. This is a measure in which many
<person_mentioned>thousands </person_mentioned>are deeply interested and one that the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>and three fourths
or more of<person_mentioned> both houses</person_mentioned> and all the influential men are anxious should
pass, and yet it has to travel the usual snails pace of public matters. This
example ought, of itself, to be a proof to some of those who are so ready
to blame me at home, of the delay and difficulty of effecting anything here.<barker_pb n="47"/>
They know but little of these matters and of the mental torment I have
suffered, to get anything done for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>At this time the feeling in favor
of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is much better and more favourable than it ever has been, and
I believe that if the attention of <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>and of <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>was not distracted
by the disjointed state of the times, something material would be done for
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, however it is really not so <hi rend="italic">very </hi>important whether anything is done
or not if a deal calm and union can be preserved in that country, 
migration—good crops—no party divisions—no excitements—no personalities
should be the political creed of every one in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The<location_mentioned> Chihuahua road</location_mentioned> should be opened by some means and must be,
I think the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned> will aid—the <location_mentioned>state of Chihuahua</location_mentioned> will aid I have
heard from there on the subject In this matter, and probably in others
<location_mentioned>Chihuahua </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will have the same interest.</p>

<p>The political character of this country, seems to partake of its geological
features—all is volcanic If there is sound judgment and common sense
in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, the convulsions here will not affect that country The prosperity
of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should flow onward like the silent current of a river—nothing
from this quarter can, or will, impede its progress. This has always been
my view of the subject, and hence it is that I have uniformly adopted
(when left to my own judgment, or not contrould by circumstances) a
silent, and conciliatory course. That policy has settled <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and if
pursued a few years longer will secure its happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Spain </location_mentioned>I presume will acknowledge the independence of <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>very
soon— the island of <location_mentioned>Cuba </location_mentioned>will then be open to us— it is the best <location_mentioned>market</location_mentioned>
for beef cattle, oxen, hogs, horses, mules, corn, lard beans, peas etc in
the <location_mentioned>world</location_mentioned>. I am trying to get a premium on <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>cotton shipped to <location_mentioned>Vera
Cruz </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Tampico</location_mentioned>—an exemption from duties and many other things in
favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. The state question was taken up in the <person_mentioned>house of 
representatives</person_mentioned> a short time since and information called for from the 
executive—it is now before the <person_mentioned>cabinet</person_mentioned>, and gaining friends dayly. My 
opposition has had a most salutary influence, and placed <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>on high ground.
The project of a <location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned>is now totally dead, so much so that its <person_mentioned>advocates</person_mentioned>
are now in favor, of a <location_mentioned>state</location_mentioned>. Even <person_mentioned>Bradburn </person_mentioned>is now an active and warm
advocate in favor of a state. There has been a great change since <person_mentioned>Grayson</person_mentioned>
left in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Don Lucas Alaman</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Gutierrez Estrada the
present minister of relations</person_mentioned>, are two of the best friends <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has in
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>. They are educated honest and honorable men, and as a matter
of course have many <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Almonte </person_mentioned>is another friend of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and
an active one. He is printing an account of that country. He says it is
favourable. I have not seen it, nor any part of it.</p><barker_pb n="48"/>

<p>There is a "<hi rend="italic">fuss</hi>" at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>—the <person_mentioned>garrison of the <location_mentioned>castle</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> mutinied tied
their <person_mentioned>officers</person_mentioned>, and are bombarding the <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>. All the rest of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is.
quiet. To say how long it will remain so would be the same as to say
when <location_mentioned>Vesuvius </location_mentioned>will or will not explode—all this is of no consequence
to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, if the people there will keep down party divisions and 
personalities and make good crops. I wish that all the unquiet spirits in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
would organize themselves into a corps and explore a good route for a
<location_mentioned>wagon road to Chihuahua</location_mentioned>—in <hi rend="italic">that </hi>way they can be usefull to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—
much more so, than they, or any body else are aware of at present.</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>Chihuahua road</location_mentioned> is a great object for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, a vast link in its 
prosperity, and no efforts should be left untried to open it as quick as possible—
its influence will be known <hi rend="italic">after </hi>it is opened, and not before.</p>

<p>I recd a letter from you not long since—the bad health of <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>afflicts
me dreadfully—we have as yet recd nothing from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>but trouble and
suffering, but I still hope that some better times are in store for us—as ta
my personal <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>I disregard them— I am laboring for <hi rend="italic">their </hi>good, as.
much as for my own—honest men will say whether they repay me as I
deserve, and to honest men I leave the matter, with a clear conscience.
Tell <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>to keep up good spirits and laugh at all the slang of my
<person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>. They are only injuring themselves.</p>

<p>Love to all the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>—keep up the <location_mentioned>school </location_mentioned>and give them a good education. I hope you have not neglected to put a <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>league west
of the Bernard</location_mentioned>—attend to this for if you have neglected it it may cost
you very dear, also on all your other land—do not neglect this as others
have done—comply rigidly with the law in every particular—as to 
settlement and payments.</p>

<p>I am in tolerable health and very good spirits—tho much older in both
respects than when I left home two years ago.</p>

<p>Remember me to your <person_mentioned>neighbors </person_mentioned>and to <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Jack </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Bell </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>in particular. Tell <person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>that I shall have to draw for a
thousand dollars on <person_mentioned>Gregory </person_mentioned>on the letter of credit that <person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>brought
me. This trip will cost me about $10,000 dead loss besides my 
imprisonment, and after all to be abused and calumniated by some of those I have
been laboring to serve is not quite as agreeable as it might be—but such
is man and human nature.</p>

<p>Farewell may heaven bless you and prosper <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I send this by <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>. I wrote you on the <date_mentioned n="03-05-1835">5 </date_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Burnett </person_mentioned>on
the <date_mentioned n="03-07-1835">7</date_mentioned> by mail.</p>
