<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I arrived here <date_mentioned n="11-24-1807">Tuesday after noon</date_mentioned> and to my great 
disappointment found <person_mentioned>Mrs. Phelps</person_mentioned> had gone on the <date_mentioned n="11-23-1807">day before</date_mentioned>—Perhaps it is
all for the best, at any rate it is my duty to believe so—They were
comfortable and well and in a new kind of Boat, in which I am told
they can ascend the <location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>. I hope it is true. Intend, early
in next week, to return to <location_mentioned>Louisiana</location_mentioned>, by Land by way of the <location_mentioned>red
Banks</location_mentioned> to Lust Ferry and so home. I think that I shall arrive 
before them— Funk has not yet arrived tho, daily expected—I have
it in contemplation to purchase a <person_mentioned>negro wench</person_mentioned> about 15 years old,
<person_mentioned>Mr. Hunter</person_mentioned> thinks I can get her for $300.   You know there is no<barker_pb n="143"/>
such thing as getting a <person_mentioned>servant </person_mentioned>of that kind in <location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>if I should
purchase, I shall take your Shott and give orders for mine to be
delivered to you, when arrived here—as yet I can find no market for
Shott or Lead—I am told there is no difficulty in getting it carted
to <location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned>for 3/ pr. cw. I shall send on your Lead by the first
waggon, if any offers before I leave this—if not, I shall leave 
directions with my Friend<person_mentioned> Gilley</person_mentioned>, to forward it on, as well as the 2000
of shott when it arrives—I find the mail goes only once a week to
<location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned>, of course, I can't get a Letter from you after <date_mentioned n="11-29-1807">to 
Morrow</date_mentioned>—you will probably get another from me before I start—I 
order'd my Shott shipped to the care of <person_mentioned>Messrs. Bullets</person_mentioned>—I shall now
give them directions to deliver them and what Letters, etc may come
on to <person_mentioned>Mr. Gilley</person_mentioned>—who will advise you whenever they arrive—I 
presume you will return this way, I wish you therefore to bring with
you whatever Letters etc are for me—My best respects to <person_mentioned>Mrs Austin
</person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mr. Carrs Family—</person_mentioned></p>
