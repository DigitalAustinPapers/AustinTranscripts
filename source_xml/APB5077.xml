<p><location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-16-1835">Decr. 16</date_mentioned></p>

<p>The gray horse that <person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> rides down belongs to my brother in
law <person_mentioned>Perry</person_mentioned>, I wish you to take charge of him and keep him at your <location_mentioned>house</location_mentioned>—
I hear that the Schooner Wm Robins sails <date_mentioned n="12-17-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>—I shall be down by
the middle of the day, and <person_mentioned>Perry</person_mentioned>s gray horse can be sent up with the one I
ride down; if you can, have him taken over to <location_mentioned>your side of the river</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I am in bad health for a winters journey—a bad cold has settled on my
lungs and I have an annoying dry cough which is very severe—</p>

<p>The ideas advocated, and circulated through the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="Summer-1835">last summer</date_mentioned>
when <person_mentioned>Zavala </person_mentioned>was at your <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>on his first landing, are extending rapidly
amongst the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mexia</person_mentioned>'s situation is very unpleasant—he has scarsely escaped insult, and
I am told that I am denounced as a <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>etc, merely for treating <person_mentioned>Viesca</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>and a few <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>with common politeness—</p>

<p>These things however are not carried to any thing like the extreme, that
I fear they will be. I say, fear they will be, because some outrage upon
justice and hospitality may be committed by our excited <person_mentioned>patriots</person_mentioned>, as they
call themselves, that will do no credit to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have a draft on you from the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt</person_mentioned>, for $500. Is it good
for any thing—I want some money for travelling expenses—How is <person_mentioned>Mexia</person_mentioned>
to get his <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>on to <location_mentioned>Copano</location_mentioned>—He is in a good deal of trouble—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr Thomas F McKinny</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Quintana</location_mentioned></p>
