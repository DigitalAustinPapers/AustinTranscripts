<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-31-1834">Decr 31 1834</date_mentioned></p>

<p>My <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>I can at last inform you that I am at liberty. I was discharged
from <location_mentioned>prison </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="12-25-1834">25th (Christmas day)</date_mentioned> by giving bail not to leave the
<location_mentioned>federal district</location_mentioned>. I consider this almost equal to a full acquital, for a verry
minute investigation of my case was made before bail was allowed. It
will probably take a month to conclude my business so that I can start
<location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, tho my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>think it will be finished much sooner. I hope to see
you in <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>when the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>meets.</p>

<p>My health is tolerably good and improving very fast. <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>ought
to meet <date_mentioned n="01-01-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>, but there was not a <person_mentioned>majority of the Senate</person_mentioned> up to <date_mentioned n="12-30-1834">last
night</date_mentioned>—the others are expected <date_mentioned n="12-31-1834">to day</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>All I can say about political affairs, is that I have been too long out of
the world to know much about them, and those who have had better 
opportunities seem to know as little—en fin, parece que nadie entiende las
cosas, las personas, ni aun a si mismo.</p>

<p>Great political difficulties are feared by many, while others seem to rely
on a <hi rend="italic">peace of exhaustion</hi>—the want of means to revolutionise—</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, as a matter of course, will remain tranquil—a dead calm as to
politics, and activity as to farming and planting, will insure the prosperity
of that country.</p>

<p>There are a number of <location_mentioned>cotton factories</location_mentioned> building here and at <location_mentioned>Puebla</location_mentioned>.
They appear to rely very much on <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>for a regular supply of cotton.
I think that this market will be tolerably steady for a few years, at fifteen,
to twenty cents delivered at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>—tho this calculation is below what
others make.</p>

<p>I see that the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>have done one thing which I urged last year, (as
was then said) with intemperate energy, that is the establishment of a
weekly mail to the <location_mentioned>Sabine river</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>All I will say at present as to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is that during my stay here I shall
not loose sight of the interests of that <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, nor permit past sufferings
to discourage me. At present I see no material good that can result from
Stiring the State question by the<person_mentioned> people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and for this reason I
have in my former letters recommended silence, or at least a calm on that
question at home. Enough has been done to attract the attention of the
<person_mentioned>principal men</person_mentioned>—to induce investigation. In my case the memorials of the
convention, that of <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>of <date_mentioned n="12-19-1832">19 Decr- 1832</date_mentioned> and many other papers on the
subject have been carefully examined—the subject is now <hi rend="italic">understood</hi>. which<barker_pb n="37"/>
it was not before, and I believe that the opinion is becoming fixed that
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>ought to have a <person_mentioned>local Govt</person_mentioned> without any delay; and that the <person_mentioned>people
of <location_mentioned>that country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, or myself have never had any designs to separate from the
<location_mentioned>Mexican republic</location_mentioned>. My liberty depended on this latter idea, and the best
proof that can be given that it is no longer believed <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>wished to
separate from the <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>, is the fact of my liberation. One of the main
objects of my mission was obtained <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">last year </date_mentioned>by the repeal of the 11 article
of the <date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">April </date_mentioned>law. The other the State question remaind pending. The past
will not, in any manner, deter me from moving it in <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>again 
provided I see any prospect of doing good. But more can now be obtained
by mildness, than by any other means, and for the plain <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, that at
this time the <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>is almost prostrated as to physical force, but has more
pride than ever. In this state of things, the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>would do <hi rend="italic">much</hi>, if it had
the <hi rend="italic">appearance </hi>of confering a favor—but nothing that would seem to be
conceded to threats or violence</p>.

<p>I believe that the interference of <person_mentioned>D Lucas Alaman</person_mentioned> contributed very 
materially to my liberation. He visited me frequently in <location_mentioned>prison</location_mentioned>, and so did
<person_mentioned>D. Ramos Arispe</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Almonte </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Victor Blanco</person_mentioned>. I can have no doubt of the
friendly disposition of these <person_mentioned>gentlemen </person_mentioned>towards me. The <person_mentioned>president Santana
</person_mentioned>has uniformly expressed himself friendly to me. I have not yet seen him-
but little can be said in favor of his political course in general, So I will
say no more about him.</p>

<p>Send this to <person_mentioned>Perry</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Miller </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Martin </person_mentioned>etc.</p>
<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A</person_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Will write next mail</p>
<p>-[undeciperable] is well</p>
<p>Al <person_mentioned>Senor D. Samuel M Williams</person_mentioned> o<person_mentioned> J B Miller </person_mentioned><location_mentioned>San Felipe De Austin Texas</location_mentioned></p>
