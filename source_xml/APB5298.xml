<p>Confidential	<location_mentioned>Orozimbo </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="11-05-1836">Nov 5th /36</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My much esteemed Sir,</p>
<p>Through the channel of your <person_mentioned>Commissioners</person_mentioned>—and by my conversation
with you on the <date_mentioned n="11-02-1836">2d. inst</date_mentioned>. I have manifested to you the importance of my
visit to <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned>—to regulate the most effectual mode of 
terminating the <person_mentioned>Texian </person_mentioned>Question—and as time is passing without any definitive 
action—when it is most precious—I am desirous that you who are so deeply
interested in the welfare of this country—should expedite the final 
determination of this question—Using if you should deem it advisable the 
following reason—When the treaty of the <date_mentioned n="05-14-1836">14th of May</date_mentioned> was entered into, it
was based upon the principle that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should form an independent 
nation—and should acquire a legal existence by means of the 
acknowldgement of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—but as that basis has been changed by the recent 
declaration of the <person_mentioned>People of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in favor of annexation to the <location_mentioned>U. S. of the
North</location_mentioned>—it appears to me that the question is much simplified by this 
declaration of the <person_mentioned>Texians</person_mentioned>—because in future—it will appertain to the <person_mentioned>cabinet
of <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to regulate this matter—and a definitive treaty as is 
desired— The mode of effecting this important object without loss of time<barker_pb n="448"/>
is what I hope to attain by my conference with the <person_mentioned>cabinet at <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>,
conciliating at the same time all interests. Convinced as I am that <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
will never reunite with <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—I am desirous on my part to improve the
advantages which may offer, and avoid the sacrifices—which will occur—
should an imprudent attempt be made to reconquer this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>—which
has hitherto proved more detrimental—than beneficial—consequently 
reducing the <person_mentioned>Texian </person_mentioned>question to this single point the regulation of the limits
between the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, which you are aware has been pending
many years—and which may be fixed at the <location_mentioned>Nueces</location_mentioned>—at the <location_mentioned>Bravo del Norte</location_mentioned>
or any other <location_mentioned>boundary </location_mentioned>it may be decided on at <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>—thus avoiding
disagreeable discussions—which might delay the definite termination of
this question—or cause a difficulty between two friendly <location_mentioned>Nations</location_mentioned>— This
in substance is a plain safe and Speedy mode of terminating this important
matter—and as all are interested, it becomes necessary that you facilitate
my journey to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>with the least possible delay</p>

<p>In regard to the stipulation in the secret treaty that my journey should
be direct to <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>—there should be no surprise when the reasons are
known why I first go to <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned>—and in the event of sending by
way of the latter—I would desire that Messrs. <person_mentioned>Hockley</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Patton </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Bee</person_mentioned>
should accompany me—whom you can commission for that purpose should
it meet with your approbation—</p>

<p>I conclude by repeating to you what I have said in writing and verbally—
That my name already known to the world—shall not be tarnished by any
unworthy action; Gratitude is characteristic of me—and consequently you
will have nothing on your part to repent of—</p>

<p>To you—I owe my existence, and various other favors which are deeply
impressed on me—and which I will endeavor to reciprocate as they so
justly merit—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Anto L. de Santa Anna</person_mentioned></p>

<p>If you have no use for <person_mentioned>Genl Jackson</person_mentioned>s letter—I will thank you to return
it by <person_mentioned>Majr. Patten</person_mentioned>—</p>
