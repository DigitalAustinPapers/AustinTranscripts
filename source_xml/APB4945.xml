<p>Glad of Austin's election to command. Opposes risking battle with odds against us.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-13-1835">13th Oct 1835</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>You will allow me to congratulate you, on the high command to which
you have been called by the free and unbiased voice of your <person_mentioned>fellow-citizens</person_mentioned>.
Rely upon it, Sir I conceive this appointment, to be fortunate for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.
Because it will unquestionably have the effect of uniting <person_mentioned>all parties</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>You have been truly fortunate in your appointment of an <person_mentioned>adjutant Genl</person_mentioned>.
for I conceive <person_mentioned>Coln Hall</person_mentioned>, to be one of the first military men in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>; and
I think his incorporation into your <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>will greatly promote the cause.</p>

<p>The orders rec'd here<date_mentioned n="10-13-1835"> this morning</date_mentioned> were not agreeable to a <person_mentioned>large 
majority of the men</person_mentioned>; but they almost unanimously determined to obey without
a murmur.</p>

<p>We are but illy supplied with stores of any kind, but immediate 
arrangements will be made to do the best we can. I flatter myself that the place
will be dearly bought if the <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>ever regain it.</p>

<p>You will pardon me for expressing my views and opinions to you <hi rend="italic">freely,
fully and frankly</hi>. It seems the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>has left <location_mentioned>Gonzales </location_mentioned>for <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>. I 
understand your <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>does not possibly exceed 400; I cannot conceive that it is
seriously contemplated to attack <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>with that number. The fate of
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>must not be risked upon one battle; unless the advantages are so
decidedly in our favor, as to place the result beyond a Shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>If the force of <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>be such as the statement furnished by <person_mentioned>Majr- Smith
</person_mentioned>Shews, they will be more than two to one against you; and though I have
the utmost confidence in the firmness and bravery of our <person_mentioned>countrymen </person_mentioned>yet
it is drawing too heavily on that confidence, to be willing to risk a general
engagement, on which so much depends against such fearful odds.</p>

<p>They have the numerical strength. They have artillery, cavalry, 
muskets, bayonets, lances, against all these you present a band (brave perhaps
to a fault) of <person_mentioned>untrained militia</person_mentioned>, with such arms only as could be procured
in the immediate emergency.</p>

<p>The case being thus, I give it as my decided opinion, that an engagement
ought not to be risked, unless success is next to certain.</p><barker_pb n="178"/>

<p><person_mentioned>Majr- Smith</person_mentioned> shewed me yr- post script in which you express a desire to
see me. At this particular crisis it would probably be unadvisable for me
to leave. By your next <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>you can command me as I can then leave
with propriety.</p>

<p>You will be pleased to accept my assurances of highest regard
<person_mentioned>WM- H. Jack</person_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Stephen F. Austin Commander of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>Army</person_mentioned>.</p>
