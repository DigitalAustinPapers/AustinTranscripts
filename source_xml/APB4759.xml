<p>Dr friend.</p>

<p>I drop you a line to say that I am offered a contract for twelve thousand
arrobas of cotton delivered at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1835">this</date_mentioned>, and <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1836">next year</date_mentioned>, say half
each year, at five dollars arroba— Security is offered and required for
the fulfilment of the contract—money to be paid on delivery of cotton—
I think it a good offer—what do you think of it— I should like to make
something to refund my losses and expenses the last two years if I could
do so—</p>

<p>I hope that I shall be able to leave the last of this <date_mentioned n="04-30-1835">month</date_mentioned>, write to me
by return of post to the care, or under cover to <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>W. W. West</person_mentioned></hi> with whom
I am living, <location_mentioned>calle Vergara No. 3</location_mentioned>, <hi rend="italic">postage paid</hi></p>

<p>I will defer closing the cotton contract to the last so as to hear from
you on the subject— Should I leave sooner than I expect <person_mentioned>Mr. West</person_mentioned> will
take out your letters to me— It may be that I shall start by the <date_mentioned n="04-1-1835">middle of
the month—</date_mentioned></p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. are very friendly to me, and to <person_mentioned>Texas</person_mentioned>, and if things are 
conducted with <hi rend="italic">calmness </hi>by the <person_mentioned>legislature at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, all will go right—
There is no danger of a change in the system of Govt The <location_mentioned>federation </location_mentioned>is in
no danger— attend to the pretended claim for fees in my <location_mentioned>first colony</location_mentioned>—
it is unjust and contrary to law, for that <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>was not under the law of
<date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1825">1825</date_mentioned>, nor was it contracted with the <person_mentioned>State Govt</person_mentioned>.</p>
