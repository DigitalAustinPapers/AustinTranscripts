<p>Asking definition of his authority to administer justice, make war on hostile Indians, and issue clearances to vessels; and that his rank in militia be determined and a port legalized.</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="body">

<p>The <person_mentioned>Supreme Government</person_mentioned> having authorized me to effect the 
settlement of a <location_mentioned>colony</location_mentioned>, which I proposed to establish in the <location_mentioned>Province of
Texas</location_mentioned>, under the regulations which have been prescribed to me,
and communicated to your <person_mentioned>Lordship</person_mentioned>, through his Excellency, the
<person_mentioned>Secretary of State and Home Affairs</person_mentioned>; some doubts arise in my mind<barker_pb n="652"/>
as to the best method of preserving order in the settlement. My 
difficulties are upon the following points:</p>

<p>1st Whether the authority given me to administer justice while
the <person_mentioned>government of the <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is organizing, extends so far as to
empower me to punish Capital Offences committed within its limits;
such as Murder, Piracy on the coast, Theft, aiding the hostile 
<person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>to wage war against us, etc., or whether, the said authority is
merely to arrest the <person_mentioned>offenders</person_mentioned>, and send them to <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>. If the latter,
tell me upon what fund I should draw to defray the expenses
incurred by their transportation, and if the former, what rules are
to be observed, in order to conform with the laws of the country.</p>

<p>2nd Whether I can or cannot make war against the hostile <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>,
and to what extent.</p>

<p>3rd What rank I am entitled to in the <person_mentioned>National Militia</person_mentioned>, and what
are the rules and regulations under which I have to organize the
same. The <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>authorizes me to organize the <person_mentioned>colonists </person_mentioned>into
a body of this kind, but did not define either of these points, and
both of them are very essential. The <person_mentioned>Secretary of State</person_mentioned> informed
me verbally that this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>would regulate this matter. The
force of the Colony should consist at least of one <person_mentioned>Battallion</person_mentioned>: Its
extent and isolated situation exposed not only to the attacks of the
<person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, but also to the aggressions of evil disposed persons requires
a prompt and effective organization of the only arm of defence which
has to sustain it; all of these considerations induce me to ask that
some system may be established for my government, and also my
rank, which should be sufficient to command the <person_mentioned>Captains in the
Corps</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>4th Inasmuch as, at the present time and until the <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>shall be
well established, there may be an absolute necessity of bringing from
<location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>, by sea, Provisions, utensils, goods and household 
furniture for the use of the <person_mentioned>Colonists</person_mentioned>, it appears to me indispensable
that this Government should make a <location_mentioned>port of Entry</location_mentioned> provisionally
of one of the <location_mentioned>Harbours </location_mentioned>on that <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>authorizing me at the same
time to furnish such vessels so trading to the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>with a clearance,
for without this requisite these vessels might be considered at <location_mentioned>New
Orleans</location_mentioned> as engaged in a clandestine and illegal trade, and 
consequently deprive the <person_mentioned>colonists </person_mentioned>of these resources so necessary to their
support and prosperity. For the want of topographical information,
I cannot now designate the place on the <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>best adapted to this
purpose, but this I may be enabled to do after conferring with the
<person_mentioned>Commissioner </person_mentioned>who has to be appointed for the other purposes treated
of in my Commission. I have no private wish to gratify, my only
object in propounding these questions is to promote the best interests
and the prosperity of the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>in particular, which ought to coin-<barker_pb n="653"/>
cide with that of the whole <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned> and the welfare of
the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>. The will of the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>in this as in all other cases
shall be my own, and for this reason I have considered it my duty
to consult with your <person_mentioned>Lordship </person_mentioned>on the subject above referred to,
soliciting your decision in the matter, that I may punctually execute
your orders, which I feel assured will be in consonance with the
accustomed beneficent intentions of the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>. God protect
your <person_mentioned>Lordship </person_mentioned>many years.</p>
