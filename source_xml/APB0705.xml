<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr White</person_mentioned> has just called and delivered me your letter of the <date_mentioned n="02-01-1824">1
of last month</date_mentioned>—he departs again in 24 hours, and only leaves me
time to acknowledge the favor of its receipt—</p>

<p>I wrote you some time ago more fully than I can possibly do
now, on the subject of our friend <person_mentioned>Hawkins' family</person_mentioned>—they are in
a most deplorable situation, and must for the present be supported
by their <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>My former letter will inform you that <person_mentioned>Mrs. Hawkins</person_mentioned> administered
on her <person_mentioned>husband</person_mentioned>'s est and left my [me] charged with the settlement of
it—but such is the Embarrassment that there will not be a sufficiency
to pay law charges etc—and such are the nature of the other debts
that it would be only to sacrifice the property in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>was it to
go into the hands of the <person_mentioned>Creditors</person_mentioned>, and your plan of keeping the<barker_pb n="755"/>
Titles in yr name until they can be made to <person_mentioned>Mrs. H. and her children</person_mentioned>
is the very Idea suggested by <person_mentioned>Mr. Duncan</person_mentioned> (now dead also) and
myself.</p>

<p>I made an Estimate in my former letter of the supposed sum
Expended by <person_mentioned>Mr. Hawkins</person_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned>, and on further 
Examination of his papers am now convinced the sum there stated does not
Exceed what it has actually cost him—</p>

<p>I shall write you by Every opportunity which offers and hope
that you will also give me any information which may be of any
importance to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Hawkins</person_mentioned> who is in <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned>. </p>                     

<p><person_mentioned>Nath Cox</person_mentioned></p>
