<p><location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="05-25-1822">May 25, 1822</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Having become a <person_mentioned>citizen of this <location_mentioned>Empire</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, by the formation of a
settlement of <person_mentioned>three hundred families</person_mentioned> from the <location_mentioned>United States of
America</location_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, under authority from the <person_mentioned>Depu-<barker_pb n="519"/>
tation in the <location_mentioned>Internal Provinces</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; and participating in the Sentiments
of joy manifested by the <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>at the recent political change, I
respectfully approach his <person_mentioned>Imperial Majesty</person_mentioned>, and offer my 
congratulations on the happy consummation of the independence of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>,
by the election of the <person_mentioned>hero of Iguala</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>Liberator of his Country</person_mentioned>
to the Imperial Throne—</p>

<p>I make a tender of my services, my loyalty, and my fidelity to the
<person_mentioned>Constitutional Emperor of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; a tender which I am ready to
verify by an oath of allegiance to the <location_mentioned>Empire</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>This solemn act cuts me off from all protection or dependence on
my former <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>—my property, my prospects, my future
hopes of happiness, for myself and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, and for the <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>I
have brought with me, are centered here— This is our <location_mentioned>adopted
Nation</location_mentioned>:—We look to the Sovereign Congress as the pure fountain
whence those blessings are to flow which will diffuse peace, 
improvement, intelligence, and happiness over this new born <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>:</p>

<p>We raise our eyes and hearts to him, whose virtues have elevated
him to the station he merited, as the Father, who is to distribute
those blessings to his people with a firm, impartial, and benevolent
hand—</p>

<p>I therefore supplicate that his <person_mentioned>Imperial Majesty</person_mentioned> will have the
goodness to take the <location_mentioned>Settlement </location_mentioned>I have formed under his 
protection, and that we be may be received as <person_mentioned>Children of the great 
Mexican family</person_mentioned>.—</p>

<p>I have the honor of presenting Your <person_mentioned>Excellency </person_mentioned>with a Copy
of my Memorial now before <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, and also the translation
of a letter from <person_mentioned>General Wilkinson</person_mentioned>, which, in addition to the fact
that I am actually settled in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>with my property and <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>,
and to the recommendations afforded by the documents already
before the <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>relative to my <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, will I hope be
deemed a sufficient proof that I come to this <location_mentioned>Empire </location_mentioned>in good faith,
and with a firm determination to be obedient to the established
authorities of the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>, and a wish to be useful to the nation
so far as I am able—</p>

<p>Will Your <person_mentioned>Excellency </person_mentioned>have the goodness to lay this letter and
accompanying papers before his <person_mentioned>Imperial Majesty</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Hoping that Your Excellency may find me deserving of your 
protection and Esteem.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>To <person_mentioned>His Excellency José M. Herrera Minister of State</person_mentioned> etc.</p>
