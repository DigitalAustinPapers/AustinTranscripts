<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I wrote you from <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Clark</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> a few lines but the Musquitos were so
bad I could say but little.   I find this section of the country are very<barker_pb n="793"/>
much dissatisfied at the appearance of being driyen out of the 
country. It appears the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">American </hi>Settlers</person_mentioned> fowarded a petition on to
<location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>requesting information on certain points—<person_mentioned>Mr Dill</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Gains</person_mentioned>—
state the Deputation treated it with much contempt—declared every
man should either move on to the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>or leave the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>this
has exasperated the people very much— The general opinion here
is that you and the <person_mentioned>Baron </person_mentioned>are the Cause of it—consequently they are
much exasperated against you— There are also many reporte in
circulation as respects the certainty of your grant etc etc—this part
of the country is settled by Industrious <person_mentioned>farmers</person_mentioned> who have opened
<person_mentioned>large farms</person_mentioned> which are in a fine state of cultivation in fact if the
<location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>was settled by just such it would be a fine thing for us all—
the intention of many of those who are settled here was to move on
to the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>—but owing to the late order they are determined not
to do so at present. I have convinced all I have conversed with on
the subject that you feel as lively an interest for the <person_mentioned>American 
Settlers</person_mentioned> of good character that are established here as on the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>Mr McNeils son</person_mentioned> expects to go on to the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>in the course of a
few weeks you can satisfy him as respects your Inocence of the
[order].... [torn] it would be satisfactory to many and many
of them would go to the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr MeNiel</person_mentioned> states that some one must have made a 
misrepresentation to you respecting his disposition towards you—he intends 
writing you by a Gentleman who starts on in a few days—<person_mentioned>B. Baily</person_mentioned> when
in this <location_mentioned>Settlement </location_mentioned>behaved himself in a most shameful Manner—
and when he started <person_mentioned>Mr McN.</person_mentioned> missed some of his horses—it is 
supposed he (B) took them and sold them for cattle—a man by the name
of <person_mentioned>Lynch—Baker—Lane</person_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>horse thieves</person_mentioned>—is said to have gone with
him.— I find that <person_mentioned>Baily </person_mentioned>being permitted to remain in the country—
and Bunch having murdered a man on the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>and permitted to
escape—and many other things—combined—discourage people from
moving into the country—and they stop here—I have nothing more
to say—to you—the <location_mentioned>Sabine </location_mentioned>has been higher than ever was known
<location_mentioned>Capt. G</location_mentioned>—states here that it is extremely doubtful whether the 
<person_mentioned>Settlers on the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will obtain rights for their lands</p>
