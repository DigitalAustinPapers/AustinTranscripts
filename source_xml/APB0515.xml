and Healthy Country possessed of the advantages of Navigation?
and to what extent?   Is your Grant an Indisputable Title, and how
large is Its Boundary? Have you yet made up the Number of <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
which you designed to receive? If so, can other grants be obtained,
and upon what terms? If your Number is not made up, what quantity
of Good Land do you offer to <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>, and their <person_mentioned>Families </person_mentioned>and upon
