<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>,</p>
<p>Dear Sir; Since leaving <location_mentioned>town</location_mentioned>, I have had many enquires made of me,
as to the location of the convention. It, seems, to be uncertain, whether it is
to be at <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned>, as both places have been 
recommended and there has been no decision as to where it is to be— Would
it not be well, for the call to be made by the most competent authority we
have, and the place definitely designated, or at least recommended? Your
arguments in favor of the Town of <location_mentioned>Austin</location_mentioned>, as expressed in the letter are
powerful and will prevail if presented to the <person_mentioned>people of the several 
<location_mentioned>municipalities of Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, through the proper channels— The spirit of "War" in
defence of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and our dearest rights has infused itself into the minds
of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>and I think it will require but little exertion to get <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>
together for the promotion of any project which you recommend—</p>

<p>All eyes are turned towards you; and the independent manly stand
you have taken has given the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Sovereigns </person_mentioned></hi>confidence in themselves— <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
can be wielded by you and <hi rend="italic">you alone</hi>; and her destiny is now completely
in your hands— I have every confidence that you will guide us safe
through all our perils— This is not the base flattery of a servile mind—
but is the reasoning of one ardent in his country's cause, and who wishes
to unite his feeble efforts with those who have the power and inclination
to lead us in safety to the desired end.—</p>

<p>There is also a doubt as to the number of <person_mentioned>Delegates </person_mentioned>to the convention
from our <location_mentioned>District</location_mentioned>— I have stated it as my opinion, that seven would be
-elected as all the other <location_mentioned>municipalities </location_mentioned>will elect that number. Would it
not be well for your <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>to circulate the necessary instructions to
pres[i]dents of the <location_mentioned>precinct </location_mentioned>elections?</p>
