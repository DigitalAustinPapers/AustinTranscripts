<p>Dear Friend <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I am told that <location_mentioned>public papers</location_mentioned> contain something concerning the
colonization but as I have not seen them I know not what it is,
I hope they have dispatched you advantagiously, the fact I shall
know on seeing the papers which I will look for today there no
doubt is much news in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>at this time but I get none of it in
this domestic vilage, and shall wait the answer here but if you
choose to answer this direct it to <location_mentioned>Durango</location_mentioned>, at which place I expect
to arrive in the month of <date_mentioned n="06-xx-1823">June</date_mentioned>, I am anxious to know what your
intentions are, and what prospects you may have before you, how
<person_mentioned>Fields </person_mentioned>came out with his pretensions—and also some of the 
particulars respecting those countrymen Embasadors and consels where
they will reside, that is in which of the ports the several consels will
reside and what are their names if they have bro't their <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>etc.</p>

<p>Do me the favour to inform me what may be your opinion of my
prospects for the office of <person_mentioned>Surveyor for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> I have made my 
application thro <person_mentioned>Doctr Ramos de Arispe</person_mentioned> who is a gentleman of much<barker_pb n="638"/>
talent, but what his influence may be I cannot say—I am yet poor I
bearly live decently by my profession but hope to do better in
<location_mentioned>Durango </location_mentioned>and very probably shall go to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to settle in the <date_mentioned n="Winter-1823">winter</date_mentioned>
if I should not get the office I solicit, by keeping up a correspondence
I hope we will meet again in this world by this mail I write my
<person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Ximenes del Rio</person_mentioned> who is in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and who you will have
known I hope before the rect. of this.</p>
