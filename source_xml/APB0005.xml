<p>Sir</p>

<p>I received your letter of <date_mentioned n="10-13-1794">Oct: 13th</date_mentioned>- and have wrote to Mr Austin
desiring him to conclude an agreement for me, with <person_mentioned>Mr Gains</person_mentioned> 
alowing him sixpence per Acre for his proportion, at the rate of Ten
Thousand Acres for every hundred Thousand Acres the surveys and
returns, provided it is of such a quality as meets your approbation.
Thus if he returns three Hundred Thousand Acres, he will be 
entitled to Thirty thousand Acres, for which I shall alow him 
sixpence an Acre out of the sales, if he returns more it will be so much
the better for <person_mentioned>Mr Moses Austin</person_mentioned>, as he is to be entitled to one third
inclusive of <person_mentioned>Mr Gains</person_mentioned> share. I rely on your care in seeing that the
best land is picked out, and the refuse rejected, and hope there will
be no further delay as I have come both into <person_mentioned>Mr Gains</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Mr<barker_pb n="13"/>
Austin</person_mentioned>s terms.   I shall be glad to hear from you as often as 
possible ; that I may know how you get on</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Thos. Huston</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr Joseph Burr</person_mentioned> at the <person_mentioned>Lead Mines Austinville Virginia</person_mentioned></p>
