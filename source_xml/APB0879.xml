<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Zadock Woods</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned>of this, returned <date_mentioned n="Winter-1823">last winter</date_mentioned> from the
<location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>, which place he had visited for the purpose of
ascertaining whether he could improve his situation by removing
thither:—he has satisfied himself on that head and is now starting
back with all his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned></p>.

<p>As it is customary for those who value a good name, to procure
testimonials of Character from those of their fellow citizens whose
standing in Society is conspicuous, <person_mentioned>Mr Woods</person_mentioned> is desirous of 
obtaining from you a few lines to <person_mentioned>Mr Austin</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, stating your 
knowledge of his character etc—and also a letter from <person_mentioned>Major Christy</person_mentioned> and
<person_mentioned>Wm C. Carr Esq</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>As to my knowledge of <person_mentioned>Mr Woods</person_mentioned>, I can say that during an 
acquaintance of five years, I have ever found him scrupulously just
and honorable in all his dealings.—And I can assure you that his
departure from this place is sincerely regretted by his <person_mentioned>Neighbors</person_mentioned>.—
He is a Man of industrious habits and of enterprise, but has, (as I<barker_pb n="917"/>
presume you know) lost a Valuable estate in endeavoring to benefit
the country and himself, by exporting its produce.</p>

<p>If you can give <person_mentioned>Mr Woods</person_mentioned> a recommendation, and enable him to
procure one from each of the gentlemen I have named, you will serve
a worthy Man, and confer particular favor on</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jn° Ruland</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>His Excelly Alexander McNair Governor of 
<location_mentioned>Missouri St. Louis</location_mentioned>.</person_mentioned></p>

<p><location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-08-1824">8th October 1824</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>What is stated in the letter of <person_mentioned>Mr Ruland</person_mentioned> to me respecting <person_mentioned>Mr
Woods</person_mentioned> I know to be correct— I would have procured a letter from
<person_mentioned>Mr Carr</person_mentioned> to you but he is in <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned>-on a visit with his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your friend &c.                                                       <person_mentioned>A McNair</person_mentioned></p>
