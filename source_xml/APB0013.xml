<p>Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you a few days ago by <person_mentioned>Mr Judd</person_mentioned>, a Gentleman of <location_mentioned>New
England</location_mentioned> who is going to <location_mentioned>Virginia</location_mentioned>, and intends visiting the <location_mentioned>Lead
Mines</location_mentioned> in order to take a view of that part of the country, if he
should arrive there I shall be glad you will shew him any civility
in your power.</p>

<p>I have since received a letter from <person_mentioned>Mr Stephen Austin</person_mentioned>, wherein
he mentions that he was in treaty with a Gentleman for the 
disposal of a part of the <location_mentioned>lead Mines</location_mentioned>, who will be able to bring out two
or <person_mentioned>three Hundred Men</person_mentioned>, bred to the Mining Business and is very 
desirous that I will send him accurate plans of the lands I have taken
up in the <location_mentioned>neighbourhood of the Mines</location_mentioned>, as he thinks it will operate as
a considrable inducement to the men to come out when they find
that there is plenty of land for them to settle upon, near at hand, I
mentioned in my letter by <person_mentioned>Mr Judd</person_mentioned> that I had not yet received the
office Receipt for the <person_mentioned>20,000 Acres</person_mentioned> which you was to return for me
as soon as you got to the Mines, nor have I recd the annual acct. it
will also be necessary for me to have the plots of the prior surveys
in order to enable me to compleat the plan which I intend sending
to <person_mentioned>Mr Stephen Austin</person_mentioned>, it is of great importance to forward these
to him as speedily as possible in order that he may be able to make
the proper use of them before he leaves <location_mentioned>England</location_mentioned>. He desires me to
write to you on this subject, and to press the business forward in
order that the patents may be obtained as speedily as possible.</p>
