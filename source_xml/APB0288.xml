<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I inclose to you 100 Dollars in Bank Notes which I drew out
of <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>and that is all I can Draw at this time   the situation of<barker_pb n="317"/>
the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>is, such, that Money cannot be had, on your Note I have
obtained a discount—but cannot draw money from the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>I got
<person_mentioned>Mr Smith the Cashier</person_mentioned> to lett me have <hi rend="italic">139.</hi> Dollars which I send you
the 50 to <person_mentioned>Mr Bates</person_mentioned> I shall settle, and the Balance of your note I think
I can draw next Week—but the <hi rend="italic">cause </hi>of all this difficulty is in 
consequence of the <person_mentioned>Bank of <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> having made a run of our <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>and
they have <person_mentioned>agents </person_mentioned>out to purchase up all our <hi rend="italic">Notes </hi>this has stopped
all notes of Ours going out untill things become a little settled then
I can draw the <hi rend="italic">Balance </hi>as to Dollars is out of the question 
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>McDonald </person_mentioned></hi>must take Bank notes or he cannot be paid. I would not have
you to Draw Dollars from the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>now not <hi rend="italic">for</hi>, 50 pr C-t it would
ruin us both in as much as every exertion is making by the <person_mentioned>Bank
of <location_mentioned>Missouri</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to run us down and I <hi rend="italic">would </hi>not obtain a Dollar but
by the friendship of <person_mentioned>Mr. Smith </person_mentioned>and If a hundred Dollars was to be
called for and by you it would ruin our C-t in the <person_mentioned>Bank</person_mentioned>— but be
assured as soon as money can be had you shall have it    .    .    .</p>
