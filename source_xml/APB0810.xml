<p>Sir.</p>

<p>I am desirous of becoming a <person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>of your colony, and a 
subject of the <location_mentioned>Mexican Republick</location_mentioned>. Circumstances beyond my controul
has occasioned me an absence of four months from the <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned>; A
link in the same chain of circumstances, requires me to return to
the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned> immediately; hence the impracticability of my mak-<barker_pb n="863"/>
ing any personal application to you at this time. The object of
this address then is, to request that my name be put upon the list
or roll of those who are applicants for land within the <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I am not aware what quantity of land you will be disposed to
allow me, under existing circumstances; I am not a married man, I
am the owner of three <person_mentioned>negroes </person_mentioned>and a stock of cattle of upwards of
one hundred head, together with some other property—the utmost
of what you are in the habit of allowing to other men similarly 
circumstanced, I trust you will allow to me.</p>

<p>About the begining of <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1824">October </date_mentioned>I shall return to the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>at
which time I will do myself the honor of waiting upon you in 
person on the above subject.</p>

<p>I am very desirous of obtaining <location_mentioned>land on the Brazos</location_mentioned>, should my
application however be too late to affect that object, I will content
myself with securing it on the <location_mentioned>Bay Prarie</location_mentioned> or on the <location_mentioned>St. Bernardo</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wyly Martin</person_mentioned>.</p>
