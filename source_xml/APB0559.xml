<p>Dear <person_mentioned>James</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I this minut recd. yours of the <date_mentioned n="01-05-1823">5th Inst</date_mentioned>, and am happy to hear
that you are not "sin consuelo".—I live at present on hope altogether,
there being no call for a <person_mentioned>Physician</person_mentioned>; upon the aggregate of good
and bad times, I bearly live decently. I should certainly have left
this place before this, had it not been that I have continually 
expected the arrival of your <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>since the <date_mentioned n="01-20-1823">20th of this month</date_mentioned>,
according to his letter of the <date_mentioned n="01-01-1823">1st Inst</date_mentioned>, saying that he would certainly
leave <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="01-06-1823">6th</date_mentioned>—I this morning recd another from him dtd,
the <date_mentioned n="01-15-1823">15th</date_mentioned> in which he says "I will leave here in company with the
<person_mentioned>Capt. Genl. Bustamanta</person_mentioned> who calculates to start in 8 days for <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>,
but if he should not go I will set out in that time "—The collonization
Law passed and was published on the <date_mentioned n="01-04-1823">4 Inst</date_mentioned>, which no doubt you will
see before you see this—he says in his letter that the <person_mentioned>Junta </person_mentioned>is now
debating the articles of a constitution which is compleatly 
demonstrative of all the Ignorance Inability and Stupidity of the <location_mentioned>Nation</location_mentioned>,
and will probabilly do more harm than good to the Emperial cause,
that the House is much divided, that there has been much pithy
speaking on the subject, and a prospect of many of the <person_mentioned>members</person_mentioned>
holding an honorable pole for the <hi rend="italic">Carcel</hi>, he also says " The 
Cannon and Bells this moment announce the acknowledgement of the
independence of the <location_mentioned>Empire of Mexico</location_mentioned> by <location_mentioned>Peru </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Chili</location_mentioned>"—I
suppose you have heard by this time of the malcontents of <location_mentioned>Vira Cruz</location_mentioned>,
it is said by some that they are depreciating, and by others that
they increase every day, that the influence of the two <person_mentioned>Genls</person_mentioned>. who
left <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>the other day for the other party, is so great, among the
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>that it will have a great affect, it is also whispered that the
<person_mentioned>Emperial Troops</person_mentioned> attacked <location_mentioned>Vira Cruz</location_mentioned>, and were defeated with 
considerable losses—the act instituting paper money on so very weak
a plan is much dispised by the people big fools as they are, this
will also have its weight, and the Constitution coming out together<barker_pb n="575"/>
with the natural inclination of the major part of the people, I think
in a fiew months will close the scene—I live on hope with closed lips,
which is one of the requisites of this free nation, the other day our
<person_mentioned>Genl</person_mentioned>, made known in town that he had it in his power to put to
death in 3 days, any person who spoke against the present Govt, or
religion—I am happy to hear of the health of my relations, and
am sorry to say that I expect it will be out of my power to see
them in a short time if ever, for I design going to <location_mentioned>Altamira </location_mentioned>in the
course of the <date_mentioned n="Winter-1822">winter </date_mentioned>to imbark for my health which is still threatened
by the complaint in my breast—the trip I had intended to the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> with Mules is altogether uncertain and what I do or wether I
go is also uncertain, I think I love chastity too well to mary in
this country, yet I know not what effect a pritty <person_mentioned>girl </person_mentioned>with 2 or
300,000 in my power might have, but there are none of this clase in
<location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>—My best Respects to all countrymen and friends—hoping
to see you and them once more I tender you my most sincere wishes,
I remain</p>

<p>Your Friend</p>

<p>[Robert Andrews.]</p>
<p>If the Alleys should return to <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>be so good as to give them
this letter.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] A <person_mentioned>Snr Dn Santiago Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Bexar Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>
