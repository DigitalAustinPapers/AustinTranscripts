<p><date_mentioned n="07-23-1822">July 23d 1822</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p>My Dear Sir—</p>

<p>I have just received your letter from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>sent by <person_mentioned>Mr. Reilly</person_mentioned>—
and have since been waiting with great anxiety to see or hear from
you.</p>

<p>There is so much to say to you it is difficult to take up the subject
of the deepest interest. Should you have reached the <location_mentioned>mouth of the
Colorado</location_mentioned> you will there hear of the various ebbs and flows by which
we have been buffetted sometimes on land and sometimes on the
water.</p>

<p>Our disbursements now exceed $6000 in dollars— I fear you have
disbursed double that sum in fatigue and constitution—When and
how reimbursements will take place we must leave to tide and time</p>.

<p>I literally long to see you. Even if all be lost we shall have some
pleasurable excitement some sanguine tho' defered hope. These are
the feelings that render us boyafit in adversity and sweeten prosper-<barker_pb n="533"/>
ity. <person_mentioned>Mr Elliott</person_mentioned> was here a few days since—your <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>
are well—There are many longing eyes and anxious hearts waiting
your return and praying that you may propitiate your, own 
happiness in the promotion of theirs.</p>

<p>I send you some <location_mentioned>news papers</location_mentioned> and package of old letters none of
which have I answered. I found it necessary to be extremely 
cautious in writing about your grant or the guarantees you could give
<location_mentioned>settlers </location_mentioned>as to slavery laws etc.—</p>

<p>My prudence was well timed—If things are as you desire, we can
now secure a population of a different cast one which would prosper
any Country—</p>

<p>I am struggling along staggering under my load—some times
ready to yield further effort—give up the world and seek some spot
where I could be allowed the peace of mind necessary to look about
me and to die —But hope springs eternal in the human Breast—
opens new prospects to the desponding mind—and keeps alive the
effort necessary to save us from dispair.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mrs. Hawkins</person_mentioned> is at <location_mentioned>Madisonville </location_mentioned>whither she went for her health—
I shall spend the <date_mentioned n="Summer-1822">summer </date_mentioned>here—occasionally visiting my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—
Should you come on we can make your stay healthful at least—</p>

<p>Your friend <person_mentioned>Mosques [Ramon Musquiz?]</person_mentioned> has been here and goes
out in the Only Son—He appears every way worthy the high
character you give him</p>

<p>Hoping soon to see you if your affairs will authorise it I remain
as ever very truly yrs</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J H Hawkins</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin Esqr</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I could not have got on but for <person_mentioned>Rinker</person_mentioned>—Do not forget <person_mentioned>Governor
Carrol</person_mentioned> Write him and say what you can to respond to his desire
of taking a grant of land and settling in that <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>There will be some matasses on board the sloop Only Son-—take
such things as you may need—<person_mentioned>J H H</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin Esqr</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Capt Ellison </person_mentioned>Sloop
Only Son.</p>
