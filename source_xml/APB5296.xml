<p>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I came here a few days ago, from a sort of necessity, to await further
Communications from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>if they are intended—</p>

<p>On the subject of recognition I think <person_mentioned>Genl Jackson</person_mentioned> will still wait a little
to observe the <hi rend="italic">Course and character of Civil affairs in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>;</hi> this being
the only matter at present upon which any real doubt or solicitude 
remains; our Independence of <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>being pretty generally looked upon as
<hi rend="italic">established</hi>—</p>

<p>The great misfortune of the delay to recognize consists in its bringing
too near together, for the action on them by this <location_mentioned>Government </location_mentioned>of the two
questions—<hi rend="italic">recognition and annexation</hi>.</p>

<p>A <hi rend="italic">decent </hi>time you know ought to transpire after the disposition of the one
before taking up of the other for reasons which will readily Occur to you—</p>

<p>I am strongly persuaded however still, as I was many Months ago, that
an interposition by this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>with <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, based upon <hi rend="italic">terms to
quiet her claim to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></hi> would be the safest and shortest mode of settling
all the difficulties; (that is if recent events of which I will speak directly
have not spoiled all the influence which this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>might otherwise
have had with <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>)— The objection with some that such a mode of
accommodation, would be selling us to the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned>, is altogether Nominal
and without the least substance. It would in fact be a sensible compromise
by an honorable <person_mentioned>third party</person_mentioned> of an unsettled question which might under the
influence of mutual passion run on to an indefinite length and involve both
the disputants in all manner of inconvenience loss and suffering— I think
our <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>would do well to <hi rend="italic">think </hi>of this alternative, at any rate, in
case the expedient of <hi rend="italic">recognition </hi>and <hi rend="italic">annexation </hi>should seem likely to be
postponed too long— In the latter Contingency instructions shd. be given
to their <person_mentioned>Agents </person_mentioned>here, to solicit the interposition of this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>in the
mode suggested—</p>

<p>What do you think of this?— if in your opinion it deserves any 
Consideration, please mention it to <person_mentioned>Doct. Archer</person_mentioned> that it may also receive his—
he being as I understand a <person_mentioned>member of Congress</person_mentioned></p>

<p>The recent events to which I have alluded as probably affecting the 
influence of the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned> with <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, are the departure of <person_mentioned>Gorostiza </person_mentioned>from
<location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>and the circumstancs under which it appears he left which
were those of great dissatisfaction— There is I think no doubt he 
required the recall of the <person_mentioned>U S troops</person_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>beyond the Sabine</location_mentioned>, and on that
point found this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>immoveable—as well as on the other in regard
to the restraining of <person_mentioned>Volunteers </person_mentioned>from going on to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— Some antici-<barker_pb n="446"/>
pate a rupture immediately between the two <person_mentioned>Governments</person_mentioned>— I confess I
have no hope of it, when I consider the weakness of <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>Compared
with this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>But who can do any thing more than guess in the dark
about such matters?—</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you that up to the last accounts I have had on the
subject, the Sale of Land Scrip was very dull— This is truly disheartening</p>

<p>I am anxiously looking for some account of the proceedings of our 
<person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>— Every thing depends on their harmony of procedure and propriety
of deliberation—</p>

<p>Please to give my respects to <person_mentioned>Mr Perry </person_mentioned>and his <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned></p>
