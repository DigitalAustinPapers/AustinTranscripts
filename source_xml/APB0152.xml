Barton and Hart</person_mentioned> for four thousand Which is the Amount I shallt<barker_pb n="157"/>
draw for at this time and in short untill the fate of my Draft are
know[n] I shall [not] Draw nor, do I expect to Draw a Dollar on
the Bills untill that information is recd-this Determination I have
taken for two reasons first because I can make the first Shipment
without the ade of the amount Drawn for secondly because the <person_mentioned>Bank
in <location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will not discount Bills at 120 Days unless at a discount
of 2 1/2 pr Cent— therefore I have submitted to a delay rather than
to submit to a Discount my Draft are of two thousand Each,
Drawn @ <hi rend="italic">120</hi> and 135, Days— I have this day Written <person_mentioned>Mr Bond</person_mentioned> on
this Subject and I trust common Interest will induce each party
concerned in this transaction to act with Honor and faithfully execute
the several engagements— assumed to each I have to complain of
great delay in receipt of my friend <person_mentioned>Hunt</person_mentioned>s letters in consequence
of the mal arrangment of the <location_mentioned>Post office</location_mentioned> establishment in the quarter
its but a few days since I recd <person_mentioned>Maj Hunt</person_mentioned> letters did not reach me
until a day or Day past—</p>
