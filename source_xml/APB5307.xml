<p><location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="11-19-1836">Novr. 19. 1836</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Your letter of <date_mentioned n="10-14-1836">October 14th</date_mentioned> was delivered to me by <person_mentioned>Cap. Henry Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>President <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi></person_mentioned> laid the papers relative to the two loans 
negotiated in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="WInter-1835">last winter</date_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Archer</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Wharton </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Myself </person_mentioned>before
<person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>and I have delayed answering your letter untill some definite
action took place on the subject—</p>

<p>There is a determination to act in the most liberal manner towards the
<person_mentioned>lenders</person_mentioned>. This <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, have already manifested their liberality by agreeing
to give a <hi rend="italic">bonus </hi>of <location_mentioned>thirty leagues</location_mentioned> to settle this matter finally on the basis of
a relinquishment by the <person_mentioned>lenders </person_mentioned>of the right of priority in locating. And
it was and still is considered that the arrangement made with <person_mentioned>Mr Triplett</person_mentioned>
was definitive and clearly relinquished all right of priority in the 
locations— The <person_mentioned>lenders </person_mentioned>understand the matter differently and thus it remains
suspended</p>

<p>There has been no bad faith on the part of the <person_mentioned>Commissioners </person_mentioned>who 
negotiated that loan, nor on the part of the <person_mentioned>Govt. of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—On the contrary this
<person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>has manifested its desire to satisfy the <person_mentioned>lenders </person_mentioned>by allowing them t<location_mentioned>hirty
leagues of land</location_mentioned> for the relinquishment of a condition that is really not
worth the third of that bonus, but which the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, found it inexpedient to
comply with.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>lenders </person_mentioned>would make more money by taking the bonus, than they
could do by the original contract—</p>

<p>I have no doubt this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>, would fund the debt, so far as paid in, and
issue certificates of Stock at a high interest—say twelve per cent, in order
to close the matter The annexation to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> I think is <hi rend="italic">very certain</hi> and
then twelve pr. cent Stock would be very valuable.</p>

<p>I think that if an <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">authorized agent</hi> of the lenders</person_mentioned> were to be sent here,
this matter could be satisfactorily arranged and definitively settled on an
equitable basis and to the satisfaction of the <person_mentioned>lenders</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I assure you, that on my part, every thing will be done that is consistent
with my duty—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Messrs <person_mentioned>Thos. O. Meux</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Jas. W. Breedlove</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Alfred Penn</person_mentioned></p>
