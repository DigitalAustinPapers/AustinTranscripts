<p>[August 5, 1823 ?]</p>

<p>Since the commencement of this <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>no labor or expence has
been spared on my part towards its organization benefit and 
security— And I shall always be ready and willing to risk my health, my
property or my life for the common advantage of those who have 
embarked with me in this enterprise. As a proof of the reality of this
declaration I have determined to augment at my own private expence
the <person_mentioned>company of men </person_mentioned>which was raised by order of the late <person_mentioned>Govr.
Trespalacios </person_mentioned>for the defence of the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>against hostile <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>.
I therefore by these presents give public notice that I will employ ten
men in addition to those employed by the <person_mentioned>Govert</person_mentioned>. to act as <person_mentioned>rangers </person_mentioned>for
the common defence. The said ten men will form a part of <person_mentioned>Lieut,
Moses Morrisons Company</person_mentioned> and the whole will be subject to my orders.</p><barker_pb n="679"/>

<p>The wages I will give the said ten men is fifteen Dollars a month 
payable in property, they finding themselves— Those who wish to be
employed will apply to me without delay</p>
