<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I am told (but know not if truly) that the three claims I bought in
<location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">1833 [1832]</date_mentioned> have been sold again several times by the <person_mentioned>original
grantee</person_mentioned>, since he sold them to me I apprise you of this that proper care
may be taken to prevent being cheated by such bad faith and unprincipled
conduct.</p>

<p>I hope to leave here in two or three weeks and to meet you in <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>
I shall try to get there by the <date_mentioned n="03-01-1835">1 of March</date_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Austin</person_mentioned>'s business is not yet
finished but he expects it will be in ten or twelve days so that he can leave—
he stands well with the <person_mentioned>present administration</person_mentioned> and men now in power and
also with the <person_mentioned>leading members of congress</person_mentioned>—but this is no time to do any
thing—the politics of the day absorbe every thing and are of too much
interest to permit anyone to think of other matters.</p>

<p>All is peace and it is believed will so remain for a while at least. If it
can be done I wish to arrange my affairs so as to remain but a short time
in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, say two months at most</p>

<p>[Addressed:] (Estado de Coahuila y Texas) Al <person_mentioned>Sor D. Samuel M.
Williams</person_mentioned> en la villa de <location_mentioned>Austin</location_mentioned></p>
