<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have just recd. your official note dated <date_mentioned n="10-21-1836">yesterday</date_mentioned>, informing me of the
resolution of the <person_mentioned>senate</person_mentioned>, requesting all <person_mentioned>Empresarios </person_mentioned>to make a report of
their contracts of colonization, proceedings under them etc etc.</p>

<p>Believing that it was my duty to make a report of the character required
by the <person_mentioned>senate</person_mentioned>, I should have done so, at the meeting of <person_mentioned>congress</person_mentioned>, without
waiting for a special call, but the absence of all the land records and
papers, and my own absence from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>on public service, most of the time
since <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">1833</date_mentioned>, rendered it impossible.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Dr Peebles</person_mentioned>, who had charge of the land records during the invation, has
now gone to bring them to this place, and the report called for will be 
presented as soon as it can be made out—</p>

<p>I must observe that this report will necessarily embrace every thing 
connected with colonization, so far as I have been concerned, and will 
comprehend a period of about fifteen years. It therefore will require great labor<barker_pb n="438"/>
and much time to complete it. My ill health I fear will cause some delay,
I however assure you that every effort will be made on my part to finish it
as soon as possible, and in the mean time any information in my power to
give to the committee will be cheerfully afforded</p>

<p>I have the honor to remain your most obt</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
