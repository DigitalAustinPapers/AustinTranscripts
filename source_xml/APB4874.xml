<p><person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I do not now recollect the language used in my letter to the <person_mentioned>citizens of
<location_mentioned>Mina</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> relative to <person_mentioned>commissioners </person_mentioned>and the effect of the law of last session
upon <person_mentioned>Robenson</person_mentioned>'s contract—but I well remember that I was informed at
<location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned> that the <person_mentioned>govr </person_mentioned>had not made or perfected the apt of <person_mentioned>Judge
Johnson</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Dr. Peebles</person_mentioned> as <person_mentioned>commissioners </person_mentioned>under the law which 
contemplated that apl. nor am I now advised as to the extent of their powers—
I was anxious to quiet the feelings of <person_mentioned>unsettled colonists</person_mentioned>, and advised the apt.
of other <person_mentioned>commissioners </person_mentioned>which the new state of affairs as represented, fully
justified. But in doing this, I had not the least apprehension that I was
interfering with any apt. actually made, and of men, whom I'know <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
approved</hi>—as well as my humble self— On this subject when <hi rend="italic">better 
informed</hi>, I shall communicate with you <hi rend="italic">freely</hi>—for the present— I shall
spare no exertions to give effect to the object of their powers, so far as <hi rend="italic">I
understand</hi> it, and see the interests of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>protected—</p>

<p>As regard the <location_mentioned>upper colony</location_mentioned>—I was professionally consulted, as to the
operation of the law of <hi rend="italic"><date_mentioned n="04-xx-1835">last april</date_mentioned>,</hi> (I think) in anulling what is called <person_mentioned>Rob-<barker_pb n="126"/>
ertson</person_mentioned>'s contract— I admitted the premises, as stated to me, that the 
contract was legal and perfect— this admitted, <hi rend="italic">you will yourself </hi>discover
that the law of <hi rend="italic"><date_mentioned n="04-xx-1835">last April</date_mentioned></hi>, is inoperative"—for the reason I intimated to you
<date_mentioned n="09-17-1835">this morning</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I shall spare no exertions to acquire correct knowledge of the controverted
matters, in which I may be consulted—and shall be ever ready to <hi rend="italic">correct</hi>
any conclusions, or opinions, founded upon <hi rend="italic">false </hi>premises—at the same
time that I shall under no circumstances be induced to <hi rend="italic">mislead </hi>my <person_mentioned>fellow
citizens</person_mentioned> with <hi rend="italic">false </hi>conclusions from <hi rend="italic">just </hi>premises— In the present 
exciting state of public feeling, it will be strange indeed, if every man whose
desire to do good, is evident, makes no mistakes—or does not meander
from the true course— honest principles will give a tone to general
character but truth well understood will be the only safe guide, in the
present crises of the destiny of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>With assurances of respect and good feelings which I will offer on every
opportunity—in aid of your prudent counsels—</p>

<p>I am in haste your friend and svt—</p>
<p><person_mentioned>D. C. Barrett</person_mentioned></p>
<p><date_mentioned n="09-17-1835">Sept— 17th- 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
