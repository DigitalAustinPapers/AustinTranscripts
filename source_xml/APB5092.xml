<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I have nearly finished copying the transfers of <location_mentioned>Lands </location_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>from
different <person_mentioned>individuals </person_mentioned>and will have them certified by the <person_mentioned>Judge </person_mentioned>and will
send them down by the first safe hand. As yet I do not know whether I
shall be able to get hold of <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned>s titles to his <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>from the <person_mentioned>Solomons</person_mentioned>
composing the <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>long enough to copy them or not. The <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>have
determined not to open the <location_mentioned>Land Office</location_mentioned>; but as <person_mentioned>Doct Peebles</person_mentioned> is one of the
<person_mentioned>commissioners </person_mentioned>who were appointed to take charge of the papers I may
perhaps get them from him long enough to take a copy of them without the<barker_pb n="296"/>
knowledge of the <person_mentioned>council</person_mentioned>. I have copied about 30 transfers of <location_mentioned>lands </location_mentioned>to
<person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>and will secure that much at any rate as I have the originals in
my possession and will not give them up if they are required of me, until
I get the copies certified by the <person_mentioned>Judge </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr. Bordin</person_mentioned> thinks perhaps we may
be able through <person_mentioned>Dct. Peebles</person_mentioned> to get hold of his titles and if I do get hold
of them I will take copies and then if the originals are destroyed the copiss
will be good; and I think there is some risk in leaving papers of such 
importance in the hands of those men who compose the <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>without a 
certified copy of the whole I send this by <person_mentioned>Mr Cane a planter from <location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>who wishes to buy land I recommended him to you knowing that you
would like to sell some land on <location_mentioned>Chocolate </location_mentioned>for the purpose of having the
land improved; he wishes to buy several <location_mentioned>tracts </location_mentioned>as he intends to bring five
or six <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>out with him if he can get land to suit him He is an old 
acquaintance of <person_mentioned>Mr Borden</person_mentioned>s his traveling companion is by the name of
<person_mentioned>Roach </person_mentioned>who also wants to purchase some land I expect they are both 
<person_mentioned>Gentlemen </person_mentioned>at least they appear to be so I write no news because I presume
you get every thing through the <location_mentioned>paper </location_mentioned>of this place and otherwise much
sooner than I could enumerate it by letter. I want you to write me what I
shall do after I get through here whether I can do any thing below or not
I am here without a horse but will buy a good mule the first chance as I
know you want mules that is if I can get the money from <person_mentioned>Mr Fletcher</person_mentioned>.
<person_mentioned>Mr. Somervill</person_mentioned> has not got in from the wars yet I look for him daily.
<person_mentioned>Johnson is commander in chief of the <person_mentioned>forces at <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></person_mentioned>. Write me often I
have not recd, a letter from you since <person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>left <person_mentioned>Joel </person_mentioned>has gone home some
time ago I heard of his being at <location_mentioned>Bastrop </location_mentioned>on his way <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, but he did
not come by this place. I shall soon be out of business and I would like
to get in some situation where I could improve myself and make 
something at the same time. <person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>spoke of taking me to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> with him
but he finally concluded that he would not until he went on and saw where
I had better be put for a year or two. In fact I did not want to go as the
state of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is such that I would have been uneasy about you all the
time consequently he came to the determination of not taking me on
with him</p>

<p>I think you would do well to get this mark to settle on <location_mentioned>Chocolate </location_mentioned>as he
will bring several <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>with him and I expect he is a man of some 
capital he saw so much land on the maps of <location_mentioned>Galveston bay country</location_mentioned> marked
with your name and <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned>s that he is induced to believe that you will sell
land cheap on account of having so much and I think the <location_mentioned>chocolate country</location_mentioned>
will suit him very well he will also purchase stock cattle</p><barker_pb n="297"/>

<p><person_mentioned>Jones </person_mentioned>is selling goods fast and at a very high price</p>

<p>My love to all the <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>Your affectionate <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>M. Austin Bryan</person_mentioned></p>

<p>N B I have heard that I have a fine <person_mentioned>sister </person_mentioned>that I have never seen</p>

<p><person_mentioned>M A B</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. I could remain here and perhaps make enough to buy my clothes
and pay my board and have some considerable time to study if you think
I had better remain and apply myself to the study of the Spanish write me
if not what shall I do?	Your <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned></p>
