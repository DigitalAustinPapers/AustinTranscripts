<p>My <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I received yours of the <date_mentioned n="04-01-1835">1st inst</date_mentioned> by <date_mentioned n="04-14-1835">yesterday</date_mentioned>s mail for which I feel much
obliged to you and am sorry that I cannot write you definitely as to our
business, but such is the uncertainty of every thing that depends upon a
<person_mentioned>Mexican Congress</person_mentioned>, that I am at as great a loss now to say when we shall
be probably dispatched as I was when we left <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>—some cussed thing
or other is constantly thrown in the way and the <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>is disposed at
any the slightest pretext—to keep from business that judging from the gate
they have traveled for the last six weeks, it is fair to conclude that they
have business enough to occupy them for the next twelve months, however
I feel as certain of success as ever.—<person_mentioned>Doct. Miller </person_mentioned>will receive the 
appointment of <person_mentioned>Chief </person_mentioned>by this Mail—and <person_mentioned>Politico Smith</person_mentioned> will be permited to go
into supreme retiracy—God be praised for this little.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Williams</person_mentioned> recd. a letter from <person_mentioned>Col. Austin</person_mentioned> by the last mail—he is
still in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and on bail— <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>has made a spirited and highly
honorable representation in behalf of the <person_mentioned>Col</person_mentioned>. which was sent in by the
last mail, and the acting <person_mentioned>Govnr</person_mentioned> sends one by this.—This I hope will effect
his discharge and that we may have the pleasure of his company home.—
<person_mentioned>Augustin Viesca</person_mentioned> arrived here <date_mentioned n="04-14-1835">yesterday evening</date_mentioned> and <date_mentioned n="04-15-1835">to day </date_mentioned>qualified,
it is to be hoped that he will grease the wheels of Govt and thereby 
accelerate its motion.—<hi rend="italic">Hell </hi>to pay and no pitch.—</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Wars </hi>and rumours of <hi rend="italic">War</hi>.—</p>

<p>Want help from <location_mentioned>Tejas</location_mentioned>—keep your guns in good order—however enough
on this subject, for further information I refer you to <person_mentioned>Mr. Jack</person_mentioned> to whom
<person_mentioned>Mr. Williams</person_mentioned> has sent all of the warlike news.—just think we have had
one fight between the <person_mentioned>Militia of this <location_mentioned>town</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>regular troops of <location_mentioned>Santa
Rosa</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—no body killed and what is worse not a gun fired nor were the
contending <person_mentioned>armies </person_mentioned>at any time nearer each other than the short distance
of three leagues—but the best of the joke, <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Peebles</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Milam</person_mentioned>,
<person_mentioned>DeWitt </person_mentioned>and myself were <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>and like true patriots shouldered our<barker_pb n="62"/>
guns and marched to the <location_mentioned>Govt House</location_mentioned> to wait orders, when we were soon
informed that we could return to our <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>but to keep ourselves in 
readiness to turn out whenever call[ed] upon—thus ended this memorable
fight-</p>

<p>Tell <person_mentioned>Paschal </person_mentioned>that I claim my fee as <person_mentioned>priest </person_mentioned>and think extremely hard of
his unadvised conduct in taking to himself a <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>in my absence.--
By the way I suppose I had as well correct a small mistake that you
complain of, to do which I do not know how I can better do it than to tell
you that I will say that it was <person_mentioned>John</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>or anybody else, or you may
say so, and to tell you the honest truth about it I was told so when I read
the letter to <person_mentioned>Mr. Williams</person_mentioned> but then you know it would have cost me some
little labour to have corrected it, and as I partake in that verry much of
the Mexican character, I concluded I would give you something to do in
a leisure moment—</p>

<p>God speed you in your labours— Tell the boys howde, I hope to be
with you all soon.—</p>
