<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Cousin</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>Since my return from the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> I have been confined much of the time
with sickness and am now barely able to get about, or attend to any 
business. I have however accepted and entered upon the office of <person_mentioned>Sec. of State.</person_mentioned>
I am happy to inform you that everything is going on well. All the 
temporary excitements of the past have entirely subsided— <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>goes into
office under favourable auspices and harmony and union is the order of
the day.</p>

<p>Many <person_mentioned>persons in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have given much more weight to reports,
rumors, and to the temporary and isolated excitements which have at times
existed here, than they merit. Such things have their hour, or their day
here, as they have in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> but a little time and reflection sets all right
again. There is as much union and harmony in all the <person_mentioned>departments of
Govt</person_mentioned>, and between the civil and military, and amongst the mass of the
<person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>, as ever existed in any <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>situated as ours has been.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>reached home safe, his health is improved and he is in high
spirits. All is going right, pay no attention to reports about <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— Love
to <person_mentioned>Henrietta</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Endorsed:] 2 letters from <person_mentioned>Gen: Austin</person_mentioned> to me and <person_mentioned>J. Ficklin Esq.</person_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1836">1836</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mrs. Mary A. Holley</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Lexington Kentucky</location_mentioned></p>

<p>To be Mailed in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned></p>
