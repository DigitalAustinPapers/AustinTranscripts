<p>Stating Mexican designs on Texas and recommending a new convention to decide unambiguously on adhesion to liberal party or upon independence</p>

<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="12-02-1835">Dec. 2, 1835</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have the honor to lay before the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt</person_mentioned> an, important official
correspondence dated <date_mentioned n="10-31-1835">31 October</date_mentioned> from the <person_mentioned>minister of War in the <location_mentioned>City of
Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, directed to <person_mentioned>Genl. Cos</person_mentioned>. which was intercepted near <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>These documents inform <person_mentioned>Genl. Cos</person_mentioned> of the measures which the <person_mentioned>govt of
<location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have adopted against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The<person_mentioned> Govt of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> places the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>war on the footing of a national
war against <person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>adventurers </person_mentioned>whose object is to dismember the
<location_mentioned>Mexican territory</location_mentioned>, and rob etc.</p>

<p>An <person_mentioned>army of 10,000 men</person_mentioned> is ordered to be organized immediately, to be
commanded by <person_mentioned>Genl. Santana</person_mentioned> in person— Appropriations of money 
necessary to raise, arm and equip this <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>are made, the <person_mentioned>regiments </person_mentioned>and other
<person_mentioned>corps </person_mentioned>to compose it are designated, amongst them is one <person_mentioned>regiment from
<location_mentioned>Campeche</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> which is <person_mentioned>1000 men</person_mentioned> strong— Arms are ordered to be made and
repaired and ammunition provided in every <location_mentioned>town </location_mentioned>and place in the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>
where there are any means of doing it— bodies of <person_mentioned>militia </person_mentioned>are ordered to be
raised, <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>are called for. The <location_mentioned>posts at Tampico and Matamoros</location_mentioned>
are ordered to be fortified, $200,000 are placed at the sole disposition of
<person_mentioned>Gent Santana</person_mentioned> to be used as he thinks proper, which will probably be 
appropriated to purchase and fit out armed vessells. In short preparations
are ordered which if carried into effect will put an <person_mentioned>army of 10,000 men</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>in
the field</location_mentioned> and a number of armed vessells on our <location_mentioned>coasts </location_mentioned>by the month of
<date_mentioned n="02-xx-1836">February next</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>This approaching storm is of a serious nature— Should the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>succeed
in giving to this war a national character as they are attempting, <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will
have to contend against the whole nation united against her— That such a
character will be given to it is probable— in fact it is almost certain, for
the reason that the declaration made by the <person_mentioned>Genl Consultation</person_mentioned> tends fully
as much to independence as to adhesion to the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>— Some<barker_pb n="274"/>
of the subsequent measures have the same tendency. The manner in which
<person_mentioned>Govr. Viesca</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Col Gonzales</person_mentioned> have been recd. will also have its effect. The
organization of a <person_mentioned>local Govt</person_mentioned>, without a clear and positive declaration that it
was done as a <location_mentioned>member of the Mexican confederation</location_mentioned> under the constitution
of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date_mentioned>and law of <date_mentioned n="07-12-1824">7 July of that year</date_mentioned> will be represented by our <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>
to mean a different thing from what was intended. In short the impression
has gone abroad that independence is the object and the only object of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— This being the case there is at least some probability that the <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
war will assume the character which the <person_mentioned>govt of Mexico</person_mentioned> are endeavoring
to give it, and that all <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>will unite against us—</p>

<p>Under this view of the subject, it is evident that the most prompt and
efficient measures must be adopted to prepare for the approaching storm
either by the most close and perfect and unequivocal union and 
cooperation with the remnants of the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> which was the true position and
in my opinion the one that should have been taken without ambiguity by
the conn. or by a direct declaration of independence—</p>

<p>Can either of these two positions be taken without a resort to the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>
by the election of a <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>where the representation will be equal. At
the former elections the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> did not and could not fully 
understand their true situation, for it was not certainly known then what changes
would take place in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and What kind of a Govt would be established
or what course would be pursued towards <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— It was only known to
a certainty that the <person_mentioned>central party </person_mentioned>were in power that all their measures
tended to the distruction of the federal sistem, and that preparations were
making to invade <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— At this time the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>know that the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>has
been changed by the basis established in the decree of <date_mentioned n="10-03-1835">3 October last</date_mentioned>, and
that they are threatened with total extermination— In short the whole 
picture is now clearly before them, they see the dangers that hang over them.—
Can these dangers be averted by a provisional organization which is based
upon a declaration that is susceptible of different constructions. Does not
the situation of the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>require a more fixed and stable state of things.
In short is it not now necessary that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should say in plain and positive
language what position she will occupy and can this declaration be made
without a new and direct resort to the people by calling a convention in
which the representation will be as equal in proportion to the population,
as can be obtained—</p>

<p>These are questions of the most vital importance— I respectfully submit
them to the consideration of the <person_mentioned>provisional Govt.</person_mentioned> in the full confidence
that all the attention will be given to them which they merit, and that no
time will be lost in coming to some resolution of a decisive character.</p>

<p>[Stephen F. Austin.]</p>
