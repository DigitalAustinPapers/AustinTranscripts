<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having a <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>engaged in the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I myself feel a deep
interest in its progress and an anxious desire to promote, by any means in
my power, its success. For that purpose, I am desirous of lending my feeble
aid to excite, in its favour, the sympathies of our public, and secure it, as
well the advantage of a recognition by <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, as more direct and 
effectual aid, by collections etc. This has caused, and I hope will excuse, this
intrusion upon you, I would have called upon and consulted you during
your stay in the <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>, but was myself absent. I have succeeded in enlisting
the press of this city in favour of popular movements and have issued a
call for a meeting preparatory to a general town meeting. I should like to
have your views in relation to the proper course to be adopted and the
measures most likely to prove serviceable to the cause—if any such are
within the scope of [y]our power. Should you return to <location_mentioned>Phil </location_mentioned>I will be
happy to wait on you— if not, I would be gratified to learn if any, and
what, course, will be calculated to promote the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Robert T. Conrad</person_mentioned></p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>referred to is <person_mentioned>Edward Conrad</person_mentioned>—a member of the <person_mentioned>Texian
Convention</person_mentioned> and one of the <person_mentioned>Committee to draw up the Declaration</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
