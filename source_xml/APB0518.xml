in or with that letter I sent a Book Entitled the Rights of Man by
<person_mentioned>Thomas Paine</person_mentioned> and translated into Spanish and published by <person_mentioned>Mr
Gary of <location_mentioned>Philada</location_mentioned>'</person_mentioned> for the particular use and benefit of <location_mentioned>Spanish 
America</location_mentioned> when that Book arrives I wish it may be presented to the 
<person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>for his Perusal and then forwarded to <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>or elsewhere, as
your <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>may advise where they may think it
may be most use full—<person_mentioned>General Wilkinson</person_mentioned> sailed from <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> for
<location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> in <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1822">March </date_mentioned>and intended to go from thence to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, but
we hear he was not permitted to Land at <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> and Intended
to Land at some other place and go on to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, his business is
private and nothing to do with the <person_mentioned>government of the <location_mentioned>United
States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—It seems by communications from <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>that the <person_mentioned>Govt
of <location_mentioned>Spain</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> Entirely disapproves of the <location_mentioned>Cordova </location_mentioned>convention and
mean to make other Efforts to reduce the Rebellious <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>to
submission to the Despotism under which that Country has so 
long-groaned; our <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>having acknowledged the independency
of <location_mentioned>Spanish American</location_mentioned> seems to have greatly offended the <person_mentioned>Spanish
Minister at <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and will no doubt the <location_mentioned>Court of Madrid</location_mentioned>,
when the news arrives there some <person_mentioned>United States ministers</person_mentioned> or charges

unfavourable impressions Respecting the Navigation into the <location_mentioned>Mouth of
the Collerado</location_mentioned> are removed, that the safe and capacios <location_mentioned>harbour </location_mentioned>
perfectly Land Locked within two miles of the <location_mentioned>Mouth of the River</location_mentioned> more
than compensates for the shoal water in its mouth where lighters must
be used; <person_mentioned>Emigrants </person_mentioned>in very great numbers seem setting that way, and
many to <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>and its vicinity—these people go determined to
support the <person_mentioned>Republican Government</person_mentioned> and be Good <person_mentioned>Citizens </person_mentioned>and will
be so I believe— I Enclose a few more papers which your <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>
