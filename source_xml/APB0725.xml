<p>Sir Enclosed I send you a translation of the Constitutional Decree
of the Sovereign <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>of the <location_mentioned>Mexican nation</location_mentioned> establishing the
form of Government also I send you a proclamation of the <person_mentioned>Political
Chief of this <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to the <person_mentioned>inhabitants of this <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and an
address of my own to the <person_mentioned>Settlers</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Political Chief of the <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> by his official letter dated the
<date_mentioned n="03-18-1824">18 March last</date_mentioned> has ordered that all the <person_mentioned>inhabitants of this <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
should swear to the Constitutional Act, and to the Federal 
Republican System of Government and considering the extent of this 
district and the inconvenience which the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of the <location_mentioned>lower part</location_mentioned>
of it would experience if they wrere compelled to come to this place,
I have thought proper to convene them at the <location_mentioned>house of <person_mentioned>J. B. Baily</person_mentioned>
</location_mentioned>on <date_mentioned n="05-01-1824">Saturday the first day of May next</date_mentioned>, as you will perceive by the
enclosed notices which you will put up without delay</p>

<p>Should the <person_mentioned>Alcalde </person_mentioned>of this district not attend you are hereby 
appointed to act on the <date_mentioned n="05-01-1824">1st. of May</date_mentioned> in his place, and you will 
accordinly first read to the people this letter—then the Constitutional act—
then the Proclamation of the <person_mentioned>Political Chief of the <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and
then my address to the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>—you will then state to them the <hi rend="italic">oath</hi>
which is in these words—" you swear to observe and obey the 
Constitutional Act of federation of the <location_mentioned>Mexican Nation</location_mentioned> " to which they
will all answer " yes we swear " and then let them give three cheers,
fire a salute of small arms, or any other demonstration of joy and
rejoicing that may be deemed proper by the people—   The oath need<barker_pb n="771"/>
not be given to them seperately but to all at once collectively, this is
the custom in this <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>on such occasions</p>

<p>I have also ordered an election at the same time for a <person_mentioned>Lieutenant
of militia for the <location_mentioned>lower division of this District</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who will be 
governed by the instructions given to you— This I do that the 
<person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of that <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>may not even have a shadow of pretext to
complain of their <person_mentioned>officers</person_mentioned>, for altho the <person_mentioned>superior Government</person_mentioned> have
ordered me to oppoint <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the militia officers, yet I have no wish to
do so, as some captious persons in the <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>seem to think—</p>

<p>The returns must be sent to me as soon as possible, and you will
resign the command to the person elected—</p>

<p>You will as soon as possible send me an account of your 
proceedings under this order that I may make up my report to the 
<person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned></p>

<p>God and Liberty, Union and happiness</p>

delay and send it back by <person_mentioned>Captain Gaines</person_mentioned>, as they are wating for
it at <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned>—there is not time to call the people together and
have an election and we could not do better than to appoint the <person_mentioned>Baron</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>request <person_mentioned>Gaines </person_mentioned>as he comes back to get the people at the <location_mentioned>Fort </location_mentioned>to
