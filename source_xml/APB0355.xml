<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I am very comfortably accommodated in <person_mentioned>Judge Scott</person_mentioned>s family who
has had the kindness to board me as long as I wish to remain,— I
feel great anxiety on your account You make such sanguine 
expectations and calculations that I am fearfull you will become too
much intangied ever to get out— there is much uncertainty as to
the <location_mentioned>seat of Government</location_mentioned>'s going to the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned> and you must take
care and not spend too much money there. I find that <person_mentioned>Wheeler </person_mentioned>is
generally unpopular and I believe the general interest of all 
concerned would be promoted by his removal   I have no confidence in<barker_pb n="359"/>
<person_mentioned>Ohara</person_mentioned>, lie may be an honest man but I confess my present 
impressions are against him, and I have to request you, as you value your
own safety, to have nothing to do with his <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>or his paper, and
above all things do not give it currency, or take it at all, that <person_mentioned>Bank</person_mentioned>
will blow up before long, and then you will be blamed and injured
for giving credit to the notes <person_mentioned>Wheeler </person_mentioned>I believe has done all he
could for the best but he is a bad <person_mentioned>manager</person_mentioned>, he blabs and splutters
too much— you aught to retain the whole of your half of the
original location, if you do so I can make a sale of a part of it in
a way that will secure the <location_mentioned>seat of Government</location_mentioned> if any thing will do
it—¦ I have no apprehensions at all as to the ultimate decision of
the dispute with <person_mentioned>Russell </person_mentioned>but it will have an unfortunate effect at
this critical time, and indeed I should not be surprised if the <location_mentioned>seat of
Government</location_mentioned> was to be fixed at <location_mentioned>Chrystal Hill</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Cadron</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Russell </person_mentioned>is
the most unaccountable man I ever saw. Money is his idol, and yet
he is distroying his own interest and throwing away thousands to
gratify a little spleen and malice. My opinion of mankind has,
unfortunately perhaps, been as bad as it could be for some years,
but the longer I live the worse it grows. Were it not for this man
<person_mentioned>Russell </person_mentioned>our unfortunate <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>might yet be enabled to secure a
small, but decent competence for if his opposition was removed I
believe there would be no difficulty in getting the seat of government
removed to the <location_mentioned>L. Rock</location_mentioned>, which might be the means of saving a
worthy and respectably family from total ruin and want whereas
be gains nothing by his opposition, but the pleasure of gratifying
his enmity and passions which I once thought were rarely to be met
with in the human brest, but I have now learnt to be surprised at
nothing I see in man, unless it is when I find him honest— I shall
remain here this <date_mentioned n="Summer-1820">summer</date_mentioned>, and after that it is uncertain where I shall
go if my <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>saves enough to support him and you get through
your difficulties so as to support <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>in the stile she aught
to live, I shall be satisfied, as for myself I believe I am nearly
indifferent what becomes of me, or whether I live or die,, unless I
am to be of use to my <person_mentioned>Family </person_mentioned>by living, and then I should be as
anxious to live as any one.</p>
