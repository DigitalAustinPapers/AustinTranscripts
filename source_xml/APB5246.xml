<p<location_mentioned>Camp Sabine</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="08-04-1836">August 4 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Sir—</p>

<p>I received on the <date_mentioned n="07-27-1836">27th </date_mentioned>your letter of the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th of July</date_mentioned>, with the packet 
refered to addressed to the <person_mentioned>President of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, which I on the <date_mentioned n="07-30-1836">30th
</date_mentioned>forwarded by an <person_mentioned>Officer</person_mentioned>. Having reason to believe the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>will be at
<location_mentioned>Nashville Tenne</location_mentioned>. in time to meet the packet at that place, the <person_mentioned>bearer </person_mentioned>of it
was directed to go thither,—where he will either find the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>, or
learn where it is likely he may be met with, on his journey to <location_mentioned>Tennessee</location_mentioned>.
I am therefore in hopes I shall hear from him in relation to the 
arrangement proposed, sooner than a trip to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>usually requires.</p>

<p>In reply to that part of your letter in which you speak of my 
guaranteeing in the name of the <location_mentioned>united States</location_mentioned> the fulfilment of a Treaty entered into
with the distinguished <person_mentioned>General Santa Anna</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>President of Mexico</person_mentioned>, while
a <person_mentioned>prisoner of war</person_mentioned>, by the <person_mentioned>Government of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, I have to regret that I have
not in my present instructions from the <person_mentioned>President of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> 
sufficient authority to enable me to make such a guarantee.</p><barker_pb n="411"/>

<p>Nevertheless should the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>General in chief of the Mexican army</person_mentioned>, operating
</hi>or preparing to <hi rend="italic">operate against <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>unite with the <person_mentioned>President Santa Anna</person_mentioned>
</hi>in an arrangement with the high Civil and military authorities of Texas, the
<person_mentioned><location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> military commander</person_mentioned> here, viewing <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>as
friendly neighboring powers, would, at their request, extend to the public
functionaries of both <person_mentioned>Governments</person_mentioned>, in the vicinity of this <location_mentioned>frontier</location_mentioned>, 
whatever acts of humanity, or courtecy, might be desired by them, consistently
with or not forbidden by the laws of <location_mentioned>Nations</location_mentioned>—or the Laws or Regulations
of the <location_mentioned>united States</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The present moment appears to be propitious for action towards the
attainment of a durable peace between the contending parties, and the 
arrangement suggested by you, if it can be made in accordance with the
views which I have just now expressed, may save an immense waste of
blood and treasure on both sides.— Whilst a continuance of war even
for a few months longer would lay the foundation for endless feuds and
bloody conflicts between the <hi rend="italic">civilized inhabitants of this section of 
<location_mentioned>America</location_mentioned></hi>—whose vital interests call aloud for <hi rend="italic">peace concord</hi>—and if possible a
close alliance, firm and durable as the Rocks which form the basis of our
greatest mountains!</p>

<p>Hoping to be able soon to address you more explicitly upon this 
subject, I am with great respect your most obdt. servt.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Edmund P. Gaines</person_mentioned></p>

<p>To <person_mentioned>General S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Columbia, Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>
