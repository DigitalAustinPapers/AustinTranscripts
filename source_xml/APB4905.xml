<p>CIRCULAR</p>

<p>From the <person_mentioned>Commitee of safety of the <location_mentioned>jurisdiction of Austin</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.
All are aware of the present movements of <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>towards the 
<location_mentioned>western frontiers</location_mentioned>. For the information of <person_mentioned>every one this Committee</person_mentioned> deem it
proper to state as briefly as possible the leading facts whigh have given
rise to this excitement.</p>

<p>When the <location_mentioned>circular </location_mentioned>of this <person_mentioned>Committee</person_mentioned>, under date of the <date_mentioned n="09-19-1835">19th ult.</date_mentioned> was
issued, information of an unquestionable character had been received here,
as to the marching of <person_mentioned>soldiers </person_mentioned>from <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, in some short period, within the
<location_mentioned>limits of the colonies</location_mentioned>. The object appeared to be the apprehension of 
certain <person_mentioned>citizens</person_mentioned>, among them <person_mentioned>Don Lorenzo de Zavala</person_mentioned>, now a citizen of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
was particularly designated and aimed at. This gentleman had come to
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, as to an asylum from the persecution of the <person_mentioned>present administration
of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. His offence we know not, except that he is the known friend
of free institutions. This <person_mentioned>distinguished man</person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>authorities of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have
been arbitrarily required by military mandate to surrender into the hands
of <person_mentioned>general Cos</person_mentioned>, who, in his zeal to secure the person of this patriotic and
virtuous citizen, actually issued an order some time since, addressed to
<person_mentioned>colonel Ugartechea, commandant at Bexar</person_mentioned>, to march into the colonies and
<hi rend="italic">take him</hi>, at the risk of losing all the force he should employ. The mere
intimation of such an order would be an evident disrespect to, the <person_mentioned>citizens
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, but the issuing of it, with the correspondent threats of <person_mentioned>colonel
Ugartechea</person_mentioned> of putting it into execution, is at once an open outrage upon
the <person_mentioned>civil authorities of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and upon the Constitution. But what is of
most importance, such proceedings serve plainly to show us all, what <hi rend="italic">kind
of government</hi>; the <person_mentioned>present reformers in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are aiming to subject us
to—which is the <hi rend="italic">government of the bayonet</hi>, and the regulation of all the<barker_pb n="148"/>
affairs of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>power, regardless of the Constitution, of the
<person_mentioned>civil authority</person_mentioned>, and of all the legally vested, equitable, and natural rights
of the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>That such is the real and ultimate object of the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>power now
reigning in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and that the reasons assigned for the present hostile
movements are nothing but mere pretexts to cover the main objects, and
thus fill the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>, is clear and evident; but should there still
remain doubts on the mind of any person, let him weigh and maturely 
consider the following facts, and draw his own conclusions.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Constitutional Governor of the <location_mentioned>State</location_mentioned>, Viesca</person_mentioned>, and also another 
<person_mentioned>governor, Falcon</person_mentioned>, who had been constitutionally installed to succeed <person_mentioned>Viesca</person_mentioned>,
have been deposed by the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>. The <person_mentioned>state authorities</person_mentioned> were
imprisoned, and a <person_mentioned>governor </person_mentioned>appointed by the <person_mentioned>acting president of the 
general government of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. This is evidently an act of <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>
usurpation and despotism, and the <location_mentioned>state of Coahuila and Texas</location_mentioned> is at this time
without any constitutional or legal government at all, and the <person_mentioned>people of
<location_mentioned>every part of the state</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and those of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in particular, are left at full
liberty to provide for themselves as they may deem best.</p>

<p>But a more general, though succinct view of matters, is necessary for a
full and proper understanding of this subject.</p>

<p>A disastrous and ruinous civil war was kindled in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1832">1832</date_mentioned>, by means of an
insurrection against the <person_mentioned>Bustamante administration</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>general Santa Anna</person_mentioned>
was placed at its head. The avowed object of this insurrection was to
protect the federal system, and sustain the Constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>, which, it
was then alleged, was attacked and endangered by the measures and 
projects of the <person_mentioned>Bustamante administration</person_mentioned>. On this principle the <person_mentioned>people of
<hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> supported <person_mentioned>general Santa Ana</person_mentioned> to defend the Constitution of </hi><date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>,
and the federal system. This <person_mentioned>general </person_mentioned>was enthusiastically supported by
every <person_mentioned>liberal </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>free Mexican</person_mentioned>, and by the <person_mentioned>friends of the federal system
in <location_mentioned>every part of the nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. With this support he triumphed. He became
the man of the people—the protector of the federal system—the oracle of
public opinion—the arbiter of the nation's political destinies. How has
he used this power, <hi rend="italic">thus acquired</hi>? Let the military despotism now 
enthroned in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>upon the ruins of the federal system—let the <person_mentioned>friends of
this system</person_mentioned>, who are now groaning in <location_mentioned>prisons </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>wandering in exile</location_mentioned>—let
the Constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>, which still raises its dying voice from beneath
the feet of military usurpation—let the free and impartial in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and
in the <location_mentioned>whole civilized world</location_mentioned> give the reply. They all say, he used it to
destroy what he avowed he had taken up arms to protect; he used the
<person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> as blind instruments to destroy the federal system; he 
abandoned his <person_mentioned>federal friends</person_mentioned> who had given him power, and united with the
<person_mentioned>military, ecclesiastical and central party</person_mentioned>, against whom he took up arms<barker_pb n="149"/>
in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1832">1832</date_mentioned>. The same <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>is now governing in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and they say to the
<person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, in the language of friendship and persuasion—in that of
<hi rend="italic">sugar-plums and honey</hi>, that in the new Constitution, or <person_mentioned>central 
government</person_mentioned> that is organizing in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, guarantees shall be given to the <person_mentioned>people
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,</person_mentioned> their rights shall be protected and secured, and they are told that
the government expects from their "docility" a <hi rend="italic">submission to all the 
reforms and alterations that may be agreed to by the <person_mentioned>majority of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></hi>.
See the official letter of the <person_mentioned>Minister of Relations</person_mentioned>, a translation of which
is published at the end of this paper, numbered I. But who compose, and
what is this <person_mentioned>majority of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> spoken of by the <person_mentioned>minister</person_mentioned>, and how are
these reforms to be effected? It is composed of the same military power
before spoken of, who have assumed the voice of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>, and have 
suppressed, by military influence, the expression of public opinion; and the
reforms are to be effected by <hi rend="italic">unconstitutional means</hi>; a sufficient proof of
which is, that the present <person_mentioned>Congress in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, who was elected with 
constitutional powers alone, have, by their own act, declared themselves to be
invested with the powers of a national convention, to frame a new 
constitution, or reform that of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date_mentioned>as they think proper.</p>

<p>What is here meant by <hi rend="italic">"reforming"</hi> the Constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>, may be
clearly deduced by the "reform" of the <person_mentioned>militia </person_mentioned>made by this same <person_mentioned>general
Congress</person_mentioned>. This "reform" reduced the <person_mentioned>militia of the <location_mentioned>States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to one 
<person_mentioned>militiaman </person_mentioned>for every <person_mentioned>five hundred inhabitants</person_mentioned>, and disarmed all the rest. The
<person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Zacatecas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> resisted this iniquitous law, but were unfortunate and
compelled, for the time being, to submit to the military power of the 
<person_mentioned>reformer</person_mentioned>: so that, in fact, "reform" means destruction.</p>

<p>From this condensed view of the past let every <person_mentioned>impartial man</person_mentioned> judge for
himself what degree of faith or credit ought to be given to the professions
of the <person_mentioned>present government of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and ask himself whether a subtle
poison may not be concealed in the <hi rend="italic">sugar-plums</hi>, or a sting in the <hi rend="italic">honey</hi>,
that is now offered to the "docile," <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>But, in addition to this general view of matters, information of the most
positive and unquestionable character is in the possession of this 
<person_mentioned>Committee</person_mentioned>, that every possible effort is making by the <person_mentioned>government in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
to raise <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>, money, and resources to fit out an <person_mentioned>expedition</person_mentioned>—<hi rend="italic">an <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>of
invasion</hi> against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Infantry</person_mentioned>, artillery, and <person_mentioned>cavalry </person_mentioned>have been ordered
from <location_mentioned>San Luis Potosi</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>, and <location_mentioned>Tamaulipas</location_mentioned>; and all the <person_mentioned>disposable
infantry at <location_mentioned>Campeche</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has also been ordered on to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by water, as it
was supposed they would stand the climate better than other <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>. 
Magazines of arms and ammunition are forming at <location_mentioned>Matamoras</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, and
<location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, and the <location_mentioned>old barracks and fortifications at the latter place</location_mentioned> are 
repairing to receive a large force, In short, the common talk all over <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>
among the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>is the <hi rend="italic">invasion </hi>of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="150"/>

<p>Now, if the <person_mentioned>present government of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is sincere in its profession of
liberal guarantees for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, why all this preparation for a military 
invasion? Why has <person_mentioned>general Cos</person_mentioned> marched with all the <person_mentioned>disposable force at
<location_mentioned>Matamoras</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> (about four hundred men) to <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, where he now is, 
according to last accoynts? Can it be that the <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>, in its fatherly care
for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, fears that there are <person_mentioned>servile slaves</person_mentioned> in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, who will
oppose <hi rend="italic">liberal guarantees</hi>? Or is it that the promised guarantees, are only
a cover and a false show, to quiet <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>until the general Government is
prepared to give to it a <person_mentioned>military government</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>It is well known to all that the reforms spoken of by the <person_mentioned>minister</person_mentioned>, and
now being made in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, contemplate the abolition of the whole federal
system, the establishment of a central or consolidated government, which
is to absorb and swallow up all the powers and <person_mentioned>authorities of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>:
<person_mentioned>military <location_mentioned>commandancies</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will supply the place of the state governments,
and the vested rights of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>under the constitution and law of <date_mentioned n="05-07-1834">May 7,
1824</date_mentioned>, are to be disregarded and violated.</p>

<p>Ought, or can, or will the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> submit to all this? Let
each man study the subject, and answer for himself. If he will submit,
let him go to the <person_mentioned>military power</person_mentioned> and prostrate himself. If he will not
submit, let him give his answer from the mouth of his rifle!</p>

<p>In regard to the present movements of the <person_mentioned>military</person_mentioned>, the letter from
<location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>, and extracts from other letters of unquestionable faith, 
[numbered 2.] will inform the <person_mentioned>public</person_mentioned>. By these letters the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are
informed that their <person_mentioned>fellow-citizens at <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">have been attacked—the
war has commenced!</hi> They will also perceive that <person_mentioned>general Cos</person_mentioned> has arrived
with reinforcement of <person_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>, and is preparing for a campaign of 
extermination against the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>head quarters of the <person_mentioned>ARMY OF THE PEOPLE</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> for the present is
at <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>. It is already respectable in numbers, and invincible in spirit.
This <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>exhorts every <person_mentioned>citizen </person_mentioned>who is yet at home, to march as
soon as possible to the assistance of his <person_mentioned>countrymen </person_mentioned>now in the field. The
campaign is opened. <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>must be freed from <person_mentioned>military despots</person_mentioned> before
it is closed.</p>

the propositions which may most conduce to so laudable an end, reckoning
always on the good sense and docility of the <person_mentioned>colonists</person_mentioned>, who, on adopting
this for their <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, subjected themselves to the alterations that, 
respecting the institutions, the<person_mentioned> majority of the <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> may think fit to agree upon;
which disposition the government is decided on supporting in fulfillment
