<p>Santa Anna's visit to Washington</p>

<div1 type="body">

<p><location_mentioned>Colombia, Texas,</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-25-1836">Novr. 25—1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Hon. T. H. Benton</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I wrote you a few days since by <person_mentioned>Mr Wharton</person_mentioned>— This will be delivered
by <person_mentioned>Col Hockley</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Bernard Bee Esqr</person_mentioned>. who go on to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>in 
company with <person_mentioned>General Santa Anna—</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I presume you are aware that an agreement or treaty was made with
<person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>in <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1836">May last</date_mentioned>, in which it was
stipulated, Amongst other things, that he should be liberated and sent to
<location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>President Houston</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>have determined to carry out
the said treaty, And have accordingly liberated <person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned>—, He
has requested that the article providing that he should be sent to <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>,
should be modified so as to permit him to proceed to the <location_mentioned>city of 
Washington</location_mentioned>, and he starts <date_mentioned n="11-26-1836">tomorrow </date_mentioned>to that city.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned> expressly says that he is satisfied, the war between <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>should cease, and that the independence of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should be
recognised by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>— In as much as the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have expressed
their wish to be annexed to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> he says that he, on his part, will do all
he can to promote that object. His visit to <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>therefore is to have
an interview with the <person_mentioned>President of the U. S.</person_mentioned> and to come to some kind of an
understanding to bring the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>question to an issue, On the basis of an
acknowledgment of the independence of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and its annexation to
the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>Whether any good will result from his visit depends on his good faith,
and on his power or influence in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>to procure the consent of the 
<person_mentioned>Mexican Govt</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>to the separation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. That he is fully 
convinced <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>cannot retain <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I have no doubt—. That fact is too
self evident for a man of his sense not to see. A continuation of the war
therefore can only result in losses and disasters to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and the sooner
it is terminated the better for that nation— He wishes the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> to mediate
and has applied to <location_mentioned>Gen Jackson</location_mentioned> long since, but no attention can be paid by
the <person_mentioned>U. S. Govt</person_mentioned>, to such an application from the <person_mentioned>President of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> while
he is a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>. In <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned> however <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> will be free—</p><barker_pb n="461"/>

<p>In Short, when he reaches <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>, you will have a man who still
has great influence in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—who professes to be in favor of the 
independence of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, or its annexation to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> etc. You are all wise and
experienced politicians in <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>, and can judge better than we can
whether any important objects of general good to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, the <location_mentioned>U. S </location_mentioned>and
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will result from his visit to your <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I must again use the liberty, which old acquaintance and friendly 
interest you have uniformly evinced towards <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>emboldens me to take,
to solicit your advise and friendly aid in this, and all other matters 
connected with this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— The true interests of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and
of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, demand that the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>war should cease, and that this country
should be annexed to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>It will be promoting the cause of liberty, of philanthrophy and 
humanity, to effect their objects; and if <person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned> can by his influence
effect them, he will add to his glory, more than the conquest of nations
could.</p>

<p>Wishing you health and prosperity and hoping that one flag will soon
cover us all I am Respectfully</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
