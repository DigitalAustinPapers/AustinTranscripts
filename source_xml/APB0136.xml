<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>... I hope you will attribute my Solicitude to a wish for your
wellfar when I request you to pay less attention to the Slanders of
your <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>and do not believe all you hear of your <person_mentioned>friend</person_mentioned>—In one
Case I found out by a conversation on quite a different subject that
you had been deceived with respect to what <person_mentioned>Judge S</person_mentioned> said when he
wished you to keep from his house this he did say but only on a
certain occasion when he wished it not to be known or believed that
you had been the cause of a certain Warranty vs. Gentlemen in your
Country because it would be believed that it was a peice of ilnature
in you and the Good effect of the Warranty would be lost and 
considering the State of the country this precaution was very proper
and might have come from your Warmest friend and I hope if you
have no other cause but th[is] you will cultivate the <person_mentioned>Judge </person_mentioned>as your
friend.</p>

<p>It was counted Good policy in the <person_mentioned>Ky Hunters</person_mentioned> not to disturb a
buffelo when he had recvd a mortal wound because if they did he
would give them much heap of trouble whereas if he was left to 
himself he would soon die— it [is] so with many of your <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>—
they have receivd a vital wound in the infamy of <person_mentioned>Genl W[ilkinson]</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>A Burr</person_mentioned> and if [you] suffer them to rest they will soon cease to
disturb you on the Contrary you may by attending to everything
you hear for ever have trouble yourself and your friends too— I
found a mason for you at four hundred Dollars or theabouts pr <person_mentioned>Ann</person_mentioned>
as long as you agree say when he must come on ... <person_mentioned>Wilkinson </person_mentioned>is
at last Caught by the Testimony of <person_mentioned>D Clark</person_mentioned>— </p>              

<p> <person_mentioned>J Ficklin</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Moses Austin Esqr.</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>St. Genevieve Louisana</location_mentioned>.</p>
