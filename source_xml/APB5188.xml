<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>By special invitation I took a family dinner with the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>on the
<date_mentioned n="05-31-1836">day before yesterday</date_mentioned> and with the <person_mentioned>Vice President</person_mentioned> on <date_mentioned n="06-01-1836">yesterday</date_mentioned>. I was 4<barker_pb n="364"/>
or 5 hours alone with the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>and the sole subject of conversation
was <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></hi>. He asked Where are your letters from your <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>?
Where <person_mentioned>Houston</person_mentioned>s official account of the Victory? Where your <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>s
proclamation calling upon the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>to return to their <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>and
attend to their crops? Where an official annunciation of the fact that the
<person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>are at their <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>and in possession of the Most of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>?
Where the publication opening your <location_mentioned>ports </location_mentioned>and fixing your Tariff and 
Tonnage. Sir says he your <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>should send an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>once a week to
<location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> to his <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>and have published by authority the true 
situation of your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and every thing that goes to shew you are a <hi rend="italic">de facto
<person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>.</hi> This is indispensible. He then commenced on <person_mentioned>Butler </person_mentioned>and
said that but for his delay and misconduct <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>would have belonged to
this <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned></hi>before this war broke out and sir says he be not 
surprised if I yet soon announce a cession by <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>United
States</location_mentioned>. This gave me to understand that he was <hi rend="italic">in treaty</hi> with <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Gorostiza</person_mentioned></hi>
and I announced to him for the 10th time that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>protested against any
sale or cession by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>. He answered that if such took place a quit claim
would be all that would be obtained from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>leaving the preliminaries
to be afterwards arranged between <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>. I again
renewed my protest against any disposition of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I write you this to let you know What is wanted here in order to procure
our recognition. Do urge our <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>to write to the <person_mentioned>agents </person_mentioned>here at
least once a week and to make frequent publications in relation to the state
of affairs in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Our latest dates from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> are of the <date_mentioned n="05-13-1836">13th May</date_mentioned>. The <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>
have cut off all communication for some time. We should now have <location_mentioned>New
Orleans</location_mentioned> dates of the <date_mentioned n="05-22-1836">22d</date_mentioned>—. All is anxiety about the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>news Many
doubt the capture of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> because the <person_mentioned>agents </person_mentioned>here have received no
letters from the <person_mentioned>Texas Government</person_mentioned>. Do urge them to write often. I shall
leave here as soon as the news is placed beyond all doubt—which will be
in 2 or 3 days as we are now getting the <location_mentioned>New Orleans papers</location_mentioned> Via <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned>
-and <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>. When the news is placed beyond all doubt I will
<hi rend="italic">demand </hi>of this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>a <hi rend="italic">decisive </hi>answer in relation to our recognition.
When this is given I will start for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>via <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned>. Do write to me
often at <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Childress </person_mentioned>has not been here since
you left. <person_mentioned>Carson</person_mentioned>'s leaving <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I mean the <person_mentioned>Secretary of State</person_mentioned> has done
considerable harm. <person_mentioned>Genl. Jackson</person_mentioned> observed to me that it in some measure
justified <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Gorostiza </person_mentioned></hi>in Calling our <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>a <person_mentioned>fugitive government</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I could get nothing definite out of <person_mentioned>Van Buren</person_mentioned> at his dinner although we
had much conversation. He professed to believe all the accounts in 
relation to <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>s Capture and said that his feelings were decidedly
with us. Do attend to the suggestions herein contained and write fre<barker_pb n="365"/>
quently first to <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>where I shall remain only a day or two and then
to <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm. H. Wharton</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Genl. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> Via <location_mentioned>Wheeling</location_mentioned>.</p>
