<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I avail myself of a favorable opportunity to address you a few
lines of enquiry respecting the tract of Country you have made
choice of in the <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I presume that no apology for my thus troubling you, may be
necessary, as I beg to refer you to a limited acquantance some short
time since at <location_mentioned>Mount Prairie in the Arkansas Territory</location_mentioned>, the renewal
of which I trust may prove duly reciprocal.</p>

<p>I have some idea of becoming an inhabitant of your <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>by
the ensuing fall, and would calculate on taking with me a few
articles of Merchandise that might answer the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of that
vicinity. Your advice as to what would be the most proper and the
best method of transportation will be highly acceptable.</p>

<p>In case of shipment from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>, to what point ought I to
make a landing nearest your <location_mentioned>neighborhood</location_mentioned>? etc. There are many
in this <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>who wish to remove to your <person_mentioned>Settlement</person_mentioned>, but are 
detered from not having any correct information respecting its local
situation, the prospects that are held out to emigrants, and the dread
of having a savage foe, committing depredations on their property
either before or after their arrival.</p>

<p>If you will give me every information in your power on these
or any other subjects touching your Country, it may perhaps prove
beneficial to your interest in encouraging the migration of those,
who are prevented from these causes. Have the goodness to address
me at this place as soon as practable. Be pleased to note what 
number of <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>have already arrived, and what are your prospects
of laying off a Town on the <location_mentioned>sea bord</location_mentioned>. This latter has been much
the subject of confab among the <person_mentioned>Mercantilest </person_mentioned>and I believe 
generally wished to take place.</p>

<p>I shall at any time feel gratified in acknowledging the favor of
your attention to this letter, and hope I may soon have the pleasure
of seeing you at your immediate residence.</p>
