<p>I regret to hear of your ill health, and wish it was in my power to send
you some suitable nourishment for the body, as well as for the mind 
however, I think we have nothing to complain of with respect to the latter.</p>

<p>I will use my utmost in raising and forwarding <hi rend="italic">"the one thing needful"</hi>
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> think too that the <person_mentioned>consultation </person_mentioned>ought to make provisions in the case, and
hope and trust they will I am just now going down to see what can be
done. You will see by the <location_mentioned>paper </location_mentioned>that the <person_mentioned>council </person_mentioned>has appointed me 
<person_mentioned>collector</person_mentioned>, and in all probability money will be paid on <location_mentioned>land</location_mentioned>, being much due.
I send you $70. which is all I have collected on your account since you left
except $5 which I sent by a <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>which took charge of the pack horse
sent with your tent. etc.— I would send you some on my own account but
for the <location_mentioned>printing establishment</location_mentioned> which at this time is a heavy burden upon
us Have not received 75 dollars yet on our subscription: and our expenses
for <person_mentioned>workmen</person_mentioned>, making improvements etc has been 250 dollars per month.</p>

<p>So long as the war lasts it will be a dead and heavy weight upon us—
<person_mentioned>Thomas </person_mentioned>writes pressingly for me to come to <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned>— If I should go, the
business could not go on.</p>

<p>Dear friend I hope the intelligence from the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> will so 
encourage the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>under your command, that they will not think of 
abandoning their <location_mentioned>post</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Tom </person_mentioned>writes me that you intend to hold on so long as
you have 10 men and that you will waste your health by inches before you
will retreat.</p>

<p>May the God of Hosts protect and preserve you many years</p>

<p><person_mentioned>G. Borden Jr</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

collected for you.—	<person_mentioned>G. B</person_mentioned>.</p>
