<p>A party of <person_mentioned>Tancahue Indians</person_mentioned>, have made, towards the <date_mentioned n="09-15-1823">middle
of last September</date_mentioned> an incursion up this river, and stolen from the
citizens their horses, several of them of American breed and very<barker_pb n="702"/>
valuable. At the same time another party of the same nation
went down the river, where the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>live very scattered, and
compelled them to give them corn, etc. etc., with threats to kill
them because the <person_mentioned>Choctaws</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Cochates </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Alabamos </person_mentioned>have murdered
the <person_mentioned>Captain of the Cocos</person_mentioned>, his <person_mentioned>son </person_mentioned>and three other <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, and a
<person_mentioned>Tancahue Woman</person_mentioned>, taking her <person_mentioned>son </person_mentioned>a boy three years of age prisoner.</p>

<p>To prevent such outrages hereafter, and to recover the stolen
horses I resolved to march against them, which I did, I surprised
their camp on the <date_mentioned n="10-02-1823">2nd Instant</date_mentioned>, and compelled the <person_mentioned>captain </person_mentioned>to deliver
to me all the stolen animals, and to inflict with his own hands in
my presence a severe lashing on the <person_mentioned>marauders</person_mentioned>. I ordered them
also to leave this <location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>and the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>at once, with a warning
that if they again attempted to steal cattle, or to molest the <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
on these <location_mentioned>rivers</location_mentioned>, I would not be satisfied with lashes only, but would
cause the <person_mentioned>delinquents </person_mentioned>to be shot, an extremity to which I do not
wish to be compelled to resort.</p>

<p>I hope these measures will meet your approbation.</p>
