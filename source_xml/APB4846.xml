<p><person_mentioned>Mr. J. F. Perry</person_mentioned> -</p>
<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>As I have determined not to go to the meeting at <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>to day it may
be well to prevent a misunderstanding of my course to say what it has
been and what it is now—</p>

<p>I have been opposed to the plan of taking <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned> without first
consulting the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>— It was certainly premature and contrary to the
spirit of our education—because we have not been taught to believe, that
a few ought to controll the destiny of all—be their motives what they may—
In all matters where the <hi rend="italic">all </hi>are interested, <hi rend="italic">all </hi>should be consulted and by
a clearly expressed will of the majority the ballance should be governed—
Because I am opposed to the plan, of <hi rend="italic">a few </hi>at <location_mentioned>San Felipi</location_mentioned> it has been said
that "I am a disappointed <person_mentioned>land speculator</person_mentioned>" if it ware so it was my 
misfortune or my good fortune— It matters not— It might also be said that
those who were so anxious for the plan of the few at <location_mentioned>San Felipi</location_mentioned> "ware
not disappointed<person_mentioned> land speculators</person_mentioned>" the one would as likely be true as
the other—but I impune no mans motives this is not the way to get at
<hi rend="italic">truth</hi>— one should not be too ready to suspect the motives of each other—
It is certain that there is some excitement in the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— I am sorry for
it— I am sure I know the cause—but how are we to remedy it—not by
strife among ourselves— we must be united— and there is but one way
that I can see to effect that object—a meeting of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>by their 
<person_mentioned>delligates</person_mentioned>— If they desire to defeat the "<person_mentioned>land speculators</person_mentioned>" no better way can
be thought of that I can see— The <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>will have all in their own
hands— I am not at present in favour of a convention, because I think
we shall be alone—<hi rend="italic">but if the majority say convention so say</hi> I but I am
for disunion with our other half, who have made it their business for the
last 2 or 3 years to ruin us— I am not in favour of supporting any of the
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>ex state authorities</person_mentioned></hi>—but shall be in favour of a clean turne and declare for
our selves— We cannot make parte of a defense— We must go the whole
or none at all— I am persuaded the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>will not fight for those who
have been their worst <person_mentioned>enemies</person_mentioned>— They have all in their own hands and
can do as they please I will go with my <person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentionedright or wrong—
all I have shall be pledged for our common defense</p>
