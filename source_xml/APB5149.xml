<p>Sir,</p>

<p>As the enclosed memorandum embraces the general outlines of the loan
for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>on which I conversed with you <date_mentioned n="04-09-1836">this morning</date_mentioned>, I take the liberty
of handing it to you.</p>

<p>I should esteem it as a favor if I could be informed within a Short time,
Whether you think any thing could be effected in this Matter—</p>

<p>I consider that the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, is the cause of <person_mentioned>freemen </person_mentioned>and of 
<person_mentioned>mankind</person_mentioned>, but more emphatically of the <person_mentioned>people of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, than any<barker_pb n="329"/>
other. I flatter myself that you view it in the same light, and that the
security we offer is good, and therefore have no doubt you will give to it
the attention which its importance merits—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>leading men of all parties in <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are favourably disposed
towards <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—a reference to them will I think satisfy all persons as to
this fact—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Enclosure]:</p>

<p>It is proposed to negociate a Loan of $500,000 for the <person_mentioned>Government of

<p>The payments of the <person_mentioned>subscribers </person_mentioned>to said scrip shall be made, 25% at the
time of subscription and the remainder in 3 equal payments at 60, 90 and
120 days thereafter, to be secured at the time of subscription, by the notes

of the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, or <person_mentioned>persons </person_mentioned>appointed by them and payable at such
place, as said <person_mentioned>Directors </person_mentioned>shall designate, provided the same be in the <location_mentioned>Cities
where said Stock is subscribed</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of submitting to you a proposition for the 
negotiation of a loan of $500,000 for the <person_mentioned>Government of Texas</person_mentioned>, to which I would
respectfully ask your consideration, provided no arrangement can be made
on the basis of which we conversed today.</p>

<p>The personal interest you were kind enough to express for the welfare
and success of my struggling <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, together with your intimate 
knowledge of such operations have induced me to make this communication.
Your answer as to your opinion of its practicability, the amount that could
probably be obtained in this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>, the manner in which the subject should
be presented, and the willingness of the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>to accept the Trust, and 
negotiate the paper, with such other suggestions as you may think important,
would greatly add to the obligation, I feel under to you for kindness and
attentions already received.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
