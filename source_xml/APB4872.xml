<p><date_mentioned n="09-14-1835">Sept. 14. 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>
<p>I have the pleasure to say that there is the most perfect union in <location_mentioned>this
part of the country</location_mentioned>— I have never witnessed a more harmonious meeting
in my life than the one at this place on the <date_mentioned n="09-14-1835">12th</date_mentioned>— Resolutions were adopted
approving in substance of those of the <location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned>meeting recommending a
<person_mentioned>consultation</person_mentioned>— All goes on very well—<hi rend="italic">union </hi>is all that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>needs—
I have recd very favorable news from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>and think they will send 
<person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>to the consultation—in short all <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will go together and that makes
all safe—<hi rend="italic">union </hi>is all— The mode of proceding is not so material, 
provided <hi rend="italic">union </hi>is the result, and the one that has been adopted of consultation
I think will produce this result— I am regulating a place to live in for
the present, so as to have room to do business and think that <location_mentioned>Austin </location_mentioned>had
better remain there untill <date_mentioned n="10-xx-1835">October</date_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Simon </person_mentioned>has the fever, and I fear that
<person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>will take it, if he comes up this <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1835">month</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I think, as I told you when there, that one of the <person_mentioned>Whartons </person_mentioned>ought to be
elected to the consultation.</p>

<p>Love to <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned></p><barker_pb n="124"/>

<p>Enquire of <person_mentioned>Mrs. Williams</person_mentioned> where my portable writing desk is— I can not
find it, also the key— I left it with her—also ask her if she knows of any
of my other things</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A</person_mentioned>.</p>
