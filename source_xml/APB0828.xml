<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have waited with some considerable degree of patience until the
present time for the promised notice you were to give me; finding
the month advancing to a close and having an opportunity of 
reminding of you by <person_mentioned>Mr. Knight</person_mentioned> I have taken the liberty of saying
that as it is a matter of considerable importance with me (and should
be with every old <person_mentioned>Batchelor</person_mentioned>) that I wish you would hasten your
visit to this settlement as every preparation is made to have a party
on your arrival I hope you are or will in a few days be able to come
down and I wish you to write me by <person_mentioned>Mr. Knight</person_mentioned> and inform me
precisely when you can come down I was on the point of coming
up but as <person_mentioned>Mr. Knight</person_mentioned> is going up it will answer all purposes be so
kind as to write me by him and you will oblige</p>

<p><person_mentioned>R. Jones</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
