<p><location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-28-1836">28th May 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Sumner</person_mentioned> a friend of mine from <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>has just arrived and shocked
me with the intelligence, that it is understood at <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Genl 
Houston</person_mentioned> is opposed to the annexation of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>. If this be
so it is truly and deeply to be deplored. Like all triumphant <person_mentioned>conquerors</person_mentioned>
he will be omnipotent for a time at least. I plainly see before me the 
turmoil and confusion and injustice and the demagogueism which must ensue
in <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned></hi>after the war is over before we can establish an orderly and 
harmonious independent <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>. Nothing can transcend the horrors of
this state of things but the cold blooded Massacres of the last few Months.
Knowing therefore that I have some influence with <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>I shall be in
misery until I see him before his opinions on this subject are generally
known or firmly fixed. I have therefore written on to <person_mentioned>Childress </person_mentioned>and 
<person_mentioned>Hamilton </person_mentioned>to come immediately here that I may start for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. This I shall do
as soon as they arrive. I am compelled to go to <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> to get the 
remainder of the 10 pr cent. I will not however delay there more than one
day and will then start for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>via <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>where I will not stop more
than another day. I feel it more important than all other things in the
world</p><barker_pb n="361"/>

<p>the present <person_mentioned>Senate </person_mentioned>should act upon the question of annexation. I bottom
this upon reasons known to you in which all of our <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>fully coincide
and they speak to me about it every hour in the day. For this reason it is
indispensible to be at home and get the <person_mentioned>leading men</person_mentioned> in favour of it. 
<person_mentioned>President Burnett</person_mentioned> I know cannot depute power to any one to make a treaty of
Cession of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>that will be binding upon the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. But he
can have the treaty take place subject to the ratification of the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>
hereafter or senate as are all treaties of this <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>. The great object is to
get it acted on here by the present <person_mentioned>Senate </person_mentioned>and we will act on it in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
afterwards and if we first get the <person_mentioned>leading men</person_mentioned> in favour of it in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>all
will go right. For this reason as above stated I am determined to start
home immediately—</p>

<p>I have had frequent interviews with the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>and he fully coincides
in these views and is exceedingly anxious on the subject. I will ascertain
from him the exact terms on which <person_mentioned>Texas </person_mentioned>can be admitted such as paying
the public debt, allowing her to keep her <location_mentioned>public lands</location_mentioned> etc. Write to me in
answer to this at <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned>. You may rely upon seeing me soon after you
are in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. With a perfect oblivion of all the past I am truly Your
Friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm. H. Wharton</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. Our <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>say they will if possible keep <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>together until
<date_mentioned n="08-xx-1836">August </date_mentioned>on account of this business. I trust in God that it is a Mistake
about <person_mentioned>Houston</person_mentioned>s being opposed to annexation. If he is I will exert my little
influence with him. We have always been and are the best of friends. Do
hurry on home without a moments delay—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Genl. S. F Austin</person_mentioned> Care of <person_mentioned>Wm Bryan</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>
