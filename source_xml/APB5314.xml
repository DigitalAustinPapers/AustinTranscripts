<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>R. A. Ferguson Esq,</person_mentioned> already in the employ of the <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>, and 
favorably known to you, has been for some time in this place, and of course we<barker_pb n="459"/>
have [had] many conversations on the present crisis of <person_mentioned>Texan </person_mentioned>affairs. He
has used his time well and won over to our cause many influential 
characters before luke warm or violently opposed. Among these are <person_mentioned>Robert 
Wickliffe Esq.</person_mentioned> who would never listen to any one else, is now eloquent about 
justice, liberal principles etc. <person_mentioned>Chilton Allen Esq,</person_mentioned> who wanted information
sent for <person_mentioned>Mr Fergusson</person_mentioned>—and having obtained it, became warmly 
interested:— <person_mentioned>President Coit</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Judges Hicky</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Robertson </person_mentioned>and others are also
through his influence much interested for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. We have had a sort of
consultation the result of which is we think it <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>that a well 
qualified <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>duly authorized should be forthwith sent to <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>, to 
resist, on whatever grounds, opposition to the vital question—<hi rend="italic">recognition </hi>and
<hi rend="italic">annexation</hi>; and we think <person_mentioned>Mr Fergusson</person_mentioned> the person best qualified for this
commission</p>

<p>These qualifications are a clear, strong intellect, prompt and powerful, in
speaking or writing, a profound knowledge of law and politics—the 
present state of <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned>—with a thorough acquaintance with the <person_mentioned>leaders </person_mentioned>of the
dominant one—having been an <person_mentioned>Editor</person_mentioned>, corresponding <person_mentioned>secretary </person_mentioned>etc.—
possessing their confidence. He has written to <person_mentioned>Mr Van Buren</person_mentioned> and visits <person_mentioned>Col.
Johnson</person_mentioned> today, to secure their influence. He is devoted heart and soul to
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—sees what she needs and wants but authority and means to render
her further survice.</p>

<p>Should a <person_mentioned>commissioner </person_mentioned>be appointed—you for instance—as I hope—he
would gladly cooperate with you. Holding a ready pen, as well as fluent
tongue, he could reply to misrepresentations in <location_mentioned>papers </location_mentioned>of the day before
they had a chance to effect serious mischief.</p>

<p>I give you in these opinions, not only my own, but those of <person_mentioned>Mr Allen</person_mentioned>,
who is an influential <person_mentioned>member of Congress</person_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>Clark County</location_mentioned> and knows
well the value of such service. He urges strenuously the measure—as does
<person_mentioned>Mr Crittenden</person_mentioned> and others. <person_mentioned>Mr Allen</person_mentioned> does not stop here— He insists that
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> also should be there: that my knowledge of the subject and my 
acquaintance with the <person_mentioned>Northern delegation</person_mentioned> from whom alone there is 
danger—would effect more than any thing else; and flattered me to that degree
that could I afford to appear there in the style my ambition would demand,
I should not fail to present myself at <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>court </location_mentioned></hi>with my two <person_mentioned>nieces </person_mentioned>as 
<hi rend="italic">credentials—a pretty, fair</hi> representation that could not fail to make an 
impression on the hearts, if not on the heads, of <person_mentioned>bachelor diplomatics</person_mentioned> Seriously,
if you come on why can not we be your <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>attaches</person_mentioned></hi>? <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>is in <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned>
and could join us. I would sacrifice a <hi rend="italic">league </hi>to accomplish so grand an
object. Nothing is wanting but <hi rend="italic">cash</hi>.</p>

<p>I am the more interested in the success of <person_mentioned>Mr Fergusson</person_mentioned> because from
me came his first suggestion of joining the <person_mentioned>Texan ranks</person_mentioned>, and because he
does so much credit to the cause to which he has so warmly attached
himself.</p><barker_pb n="460"/>

<p>We are all very well, and pray fervently for your prosperity and 
happiness—in other words—for the entire success of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mary Austin Holley</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S: F: Austin Esq</person_mentioned>.</p>
