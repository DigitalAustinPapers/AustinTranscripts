<p><location_mentioned>Head Quarters</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">Novemr lst 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>To <person_mentioned>Col° James Bowie</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Captn Fanning</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>Your communication of<date_mentioned n="11-01-1835"> this morning</date_mentioned> was received and is satisfactory in
every respect to myself and all others—</p>

<p>I sent in a demand today, for a surrender <person_mentioned>Genl Cos</person_mentioned> stated that his duty
would not permit him to receive any official communication and of course
it was returned, unopened,— He in a short time after sent out<person_mentioned> Padre Garza</person_mentioned>
with a flag to say to me, verbally that he had absolute orders from his
<person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>to fortify <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>and hold it at all hazards—that as a <person_mentioned>military
man</person_mentioned> His honor and duty required obedience to these orders, that he would
defend the place until he died, if he had only ten men left with him—</p>

<p>This is all that has passed between us— I approached on this side <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">to day</date_mentioned>
within Cannon shot—they fired four at us—one shot (Ball) passed over
our heads and one of <hi rend="italic">grape </hi>fell <location_mentioned>in the lines</location_mentioned> but fortunately injured
no one—</p>

<p>From every information the <location_mentioned>fortifications </location_mentioned>are much stronger than has
been supposed and the difficulty of storming of course much greater,—The
system of alarms will be kept up as much as possible night and day, and
the place invested as closely as practicable— For this purpose I expect to
station the <person_mentioned>Adjutant General</person_mentioned> with a competent <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>at the <location_mentioned>old mill</location_mentioned>, a short
distance from there—</p>

<p>I have no information yet of <person_mentioned>Travis</person_mentioned>— A report reached <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">this 
afternoon</date_mentioned> through a <person_mentioned>person from <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> that an <person_mentioned>Express </person_mentioned>had just been received
there, stating that <person_mentioned>Savariego </person_mentioned>had escaped from <location_mentioned>S. Felipe</location_mentioned> and had raised
the <person_mentioned>Irish on the <location_mentioned>Nueces</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and in union with the <person_mentioned>troops at <location_mentioned>that place</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> had
attacked <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>—It is however only a report—</p>

<p>The enclosed papers is from a <person_mentioned>Confidential source</person_mentioned>— I had forgotten to
mention that the <person_mentioned>Adjutant General</person_mentioned> made a demonstration on the other side
with a <person_mentioned>Detachment</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>[Rubric]</p>

<p>Since the within was written I have received yours of this <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">afternoon</date_mentioned>—
The <person_mentioned>forces </person_mentioned>are not so unequally divided as appears at first view—<person_mentioned>Travis</person_mentioned>
is constantly out on some extra duty— He is now out, I expect him <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">to night</date_mentioned>
and must then send him to escort the cannon— I wish to occupy the <location_mentioned>mill</location_mentioned>
and another position— our <person_mentioned>prisoners </person_mentioned>are dayly increasing and require a
<person_mentioned>strong guard</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>However as equal a division will be made as is compatible with the 
service—we have many sick— Every thing shall be done on my part possible
for the service and to keep up harmony</p>.<barker_pb n="228"/>

<p>Our position here is far from being a strong one— we have no bank for
defense—a good position can not be found without going too far off. I
submit these matters to your calm judgement— It is known that <location_mentioned>head 
quarters</location_mentioned> are here and the main attack will be here if any is made</p>

<p>I have just heard from <person_mentioned>Travis </person_mentioned>he will not be back untill late <date_mentioned n="11-02-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>—</p>
