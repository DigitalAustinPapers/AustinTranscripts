<p>Letter from <person_mentioned>Genl Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> to <person_mentioned>Capt. Henry Austin</person_mentioned> Dated <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>
<date_mentioned n="06-27-1836">June 27 1836</date_mentioned> — Dear Sir—<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>needs every man who belongs here—the
war is not ended— The armistice that was commenced and made on the
battle ground of <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>with the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>prisoner </person_mentioned></hi><person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>,
saved the mass of the <person_mentioned>Mexican Army</person_mentioned>, as it gave to them the permission to
retreat unmolested and take away all their arms etc— <person_mentioned>Genl. Cortazar</person_mentioned> has
reached <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>by the last accounts with the <person_mentioned>army of reserve</person_mentioned>, previously
formed by <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>—(this army was to push his conquests to the 
<location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>) and before this has no doubt reached <location_mentioned>the del Norte</location_mentioned>— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is
now better prepared for war then she was before—the retreat or rather
flight of <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned><date_mentioned n="Spring-1836">last spring</date_mentioned> has taught that it is better to die in battle—
than to suffer a hundred deaths by the exposure and fatigue of flight— it
has also taught grumblers etc that there is more safety in the rifle and
musket, than in useless and vindictive criticisms and party animosity and
selfishness— In short, I believe that the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">people </hi>of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are <hi rend="italic">now </hi>
determined to stand their ground and to conquer or die upon it— I hope you
will return immediately and if you can bring some men do so, but no
delay—and do try and impress it on those who come with you—if any
come—that they cannot be <person_mentioned>Generals</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Colonels</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Majors </person_mentioned>etc.</p>

<p>My <person_mentioned>sister </person_mentioned>came down here the other day to embark for <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, but the
vessel did not sail— I have not yet seen her— I shall advise her to stay at
home and abide the fate of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— You will say to this that she can be
of no avail here—not so—it was the panic caused by the flight of <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>
<date_mentioned n="Spring-1836">last spring</date_mentioned> which came so near loosing <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and if <hi rend="italic">my </hi><person_mentioned>sister </person_mentioned>goes, it will
have its influence on many others—I wish all of my name or connection to
stay in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and abide the issue be it what it may— Your <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>ought
to and must remain where they are in <location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned>but <hi rend="italic">you </hi>ought to be here
Bring me a sword I had several, but in my absence they are all 
scattered—, The <person_mentioned>cabinet </person_mentioned>have managed to excite popular prejudice against
them by entering into any arrangements with <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>— It was most
unfortunate—those arrangements however were begun by <person_mentioned>Houston </person_mentioned>on the
<location_mentioned>battle ground</location_mentioned> the <date_mentioned n="04-22-1836">day after <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> was taken</date_mentioned>— The <person_mentioned>cabinet </person_mentioned>are not to
blame—so much as they have been blamed <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>was saved by the 
victory of <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> and almost lost by the armistice made in the moment<barker_pb n="372"/>
of victory with a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>— An immediate and rapid advance after that
victory would have distroyed the whole of the <person_mentioned>Mexican army</person_mentioned>— But that
is passed and ought only to be alluded to now, to draw lessons from 
experience and not for vituperation—, experience tells us all, stand your ground,
fight it out, and trust to no armistice except one of two kinds—a final peace
—or death— Farewell Love to <person_mentioned>cousin Mary</person_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>Yours
most affectionately and truly</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
