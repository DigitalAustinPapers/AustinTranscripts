of this <location_mentioned>Municipality</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> could be convened to express their sentiments as to<barker_pb n="78"/>

not admitted by the <person_mentioned>agitators </person_mentioned>as an amendment, when it was determined

my motion, on division <person_mentioned>2/3</person_mentioned> were against their report— They then without
taking a vote upon my motion, so modified their resolutions as to effect
