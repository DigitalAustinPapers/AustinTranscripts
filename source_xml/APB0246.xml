<p><person_mentioned>Mr Moses Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>We are concerned in the establishment of a <location_mentioned>White and Red Lead
Manufactory</location_mentioned> at this place, and are authorized by the Company
to make contracts for the Crude Lead.</p>

<p>You are largely interested in the <location_mentioned>mines</location_mentioned>; we would therefore be
glad to know on what terms you would make an engagement to
deliver Lead at this place or at <location_mentioned>St. Gennevieve</location_mentioned>, or at any other place
you might Suggest, proportioning the price accordingly,—say 20
to 200 Tons on this side of <date_mentioned n="12-25-1814">Christmas</date_mentioned>. The establishment is 
calculated to go into complete operation by the <date_mentioned n="09-01-1814">1st. September</date_mentioned>, and 
partially in 3 or 4 months hence.</p>

<p>If it would suit you to agree with us, we wish you to State price,
place or places of delivery, what proportion of our Country produce
or what articles you would be willing to take in exchange, and in
what way you would be willing to receive them—that is, whether at a
price you will mention, or at an estimated value at the time of 
delivery. It would be necessary to know also the periods nearly at
which we might Calculate on receiving the Lead.</p>

<p>We have a former Correspondence with <person_mentioned>Messrs. Saml. and John
Perry</person_mentioned>, and shall write to them also by this mail on the same subject.
As we are acting for a <person_mentioned>company</person_mentioned>, we are the More desirous to hear
the propositions of two sources. Be good enough to let us hear from
you as soon as you conveniently can.</p>
