<p>[From the Williams Papers. Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas.]</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-06-1835">6 May 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>My friend,</p>

<p>The Amnesty law was published on the <date_mentioned n="05-03-1835">3d instant</date_mentioned>, and I shall be at full
liberty to leave here so soon as the necessary forms are completed to
cancel my bail bonds etc—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>D. Victor Blanco</person_mentioned> intends to leave here about the <date_mentioned n="05-26-1835">26 instant</date_mentioned> and I shall
wait for him if I do not conclude to go by water, for I am at present 
undetermined, tho think it probable shall go by land in which event expect to
reach <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned> about the <date_mentioned n="06-20-1835">20 June</date_mentioned>— presume you will have left there
for home long before that time— It is my wish and intention to take
wing in the <date_mentioned n="Spring-1835">spring</date_mentioned>—by that time I can close all my affairs I hope, and
be able to spend a year or two in a ramble— I have a constitutional
excuse or rather I am [constitutionally impeded by having a causa
pendiente from holding [the] seat in the <person_mentioned>legislature </person_mentioned>to which I have been
elected, so that there will be no difficulty on that account</p>

<p>The 400 le[ague] law has totally distroyed the moral standing of that
legislature with <hi rend="italic">all <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned></hi>—and the <person_mentioned>Commandant Genl</person_mentioned> has gained credit—
I recd- your letter of <date_mentioned n="04-08-1835">8 ult</date_mentioned> and the letters you enclosed— <person_mentioned>Toney [Anthony
Butler]</person_mentioned> left for the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="04-29-1835">29 ult</date_mentioned>. and <person_mentioned>Almonte </person_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="04-30-1835">30th</date_mentioned>— I have
never in all my life known so bad, and base a man as <person_mentioned>Butler</person_mentioned>— At the
time he wrote the O P Q letters he was my <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>, and yet he wrote them
as tho they came from a friend of mine, and consequently they were very
well calculated to rouse the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> into rebellion, and also to
throw suspicion on me and perpetuate my imprisonment, and <hi rend="italic">this 
imprisonment</hi> was used by him as a lever to create and keep up excitements in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
at the head of which he expected to be placed— He thinks, as it appears,
that the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> can be made tools of to promote the personal
agrandisement of <person_mentioned>A. B. [Anthony Butler]</person_mentioned>— he is greatly deceived, or
I do not know the people—</p>

<p>Everything is quiet here [and] likely to remain so— That state of
course [will] remain quiet and <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in particul[ar]—it ought to do so—
Remember me affectionately to <person_mentioned>Peebles </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Johnson</person_mentioned>, and also to my old
friend <person_mentioned>B. Milam</person_mentioned> who I am told by <person_mentioned>Offutt </person_mentioned>is in <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>, also to <person_mentioned>Carbajal</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Durste </person_mentioned>Inform them at home</p>

<p>Yours [Rubric]</p><barker_pb n="74"/>

<p>Remember me particularly to my friend <person_mentioned>Ed. Gritten</person_mentioned> who I presume is
in <location_mentioned>Mona- [Monclova]</location_mentioned> his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>are well. I recd- his letters from <location_mentioned>Quero
[Queretaro]</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>San Luis</location_mentioned> and thank him also to <person_mentioned>Garay </person_mentioned>if he is there
as I presume he is</p>

<p>I am happier than I have been for 14 years, for during all that period
my mind has been laboring and worrying for the benefit of <person_mentioned>others </person_mentioned>and
for the common good. My thoughts are now confined, or I should say are
beginning to confine themselves to a narrower space—myself, my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>,
my own individual affairs it is a novelty, a new life to me, for heretofore
I have thought more of other matters than of my own—but I shall soon
get accustomed to it and be much happier— I want some money to travel
<date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1836">next year</date_mentioned> this at present is all my cuidado</p>
