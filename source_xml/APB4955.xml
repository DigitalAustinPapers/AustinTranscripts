<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-15-1835">15th Oct. 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Jas. F. Perry, Esq.</person_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I take pleasure in introducing to you the <person_mentioned>bearer</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr Stiff</person_mentioned> who visits your
<location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, as a <person_mentioned>volenteer in defence</person_mentioned> of your wrights—</p>

<p>I feel every assurance in saying that you will find encased in his delicate
frame, a mind fully adequate to bear up through trials which would crush
others of superior phisical force, and a spirit worthy of being honorably
employed in your contest against the <person_mentioned>usurpers of power</person_mentioned>, the perfidious
advocates of <person_mentioned>central government</person_mentioned>.—<person_mentioned>Mr Stiff</person_mentioned>'s pecuniary circumstances 
renders it perfectly unnecessary that he should visit your <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>in quest of
fortune, and I think I may say, without detriment to the motives of others,
that you are indebted for his aid, to those more generous and extended
feelings, which are inherent in the bosoms of all <person_mentioned>true americans</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Any attention which the turmoils of war will permit you to show him,
will be gratefully acknowleged by</p>

<p><person_mentioned>A. R. McNair</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P.S. For fear that you will be at a loss to define the reason why I am
not actuated to the same purpose with my young friend, I must inform you
that the Yellow fever has played havoc with my once athletic frame, and
that I am now, only able to walk with the aid of a cane—I was confined
8 months to my bed the effects of mercury.—my hip is dislocated and all
in all, I would not do for the field, and must content myself, with giving
you the warmest wishes for your success.</p>

<p>I hope and think, that the excitement here in your favor, will result in
advantage to you in men and money—many have already volenteered, and
a considerable number subscribed</p>

<p>I am told that there is one <person_mentioned>gentleman </person_mentioned>here, who has 1000 Rifles, 
intended to be given to <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>and sent to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Be pleased to remember me to <person_mentioned>Mrs Perry</person_mentioned> and your <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>.</p>
