<p><location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="07-30-1836">July 30th 1836</date_mentioned>.—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Genl. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>:	Saturday 12 oclk</p>

<p>My dear sir:</p>

<p>I hand you enclosed the <hi rend="italic">only </hi>letter I have for you, and avail of <person_mentioned>Col.
Lewis</person_mentioned>, who departs direct for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, to send you the same.— I have not
had the pleasure to receive a single line from you since we parted at 
<hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned></hi>. Tho' I have seen your letter to <person_mentioned>Swartwout</person_mentioned>.— I have noticed your
arrival at <location_mentioned>Velasco</location_mentioned>, and expected a letter from you by the <hi rend="italic">Shenandoah</hi>.—
I also find that Messrs <person_mentioned>Archer </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Wharton</person_mentioned>, embarked, on board the 
Independence to return <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>.— The <hi rend="italic">latter </hi>drew on me for the $2,000 of the
Loan and obtained the Cash for it, in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned>.— We have no news
from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>except what is furnished us by the <location_mentioned>public Prints</location_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Gen Mason</person_mentioned>
was at <location_mentioned>Cincinnatti</location_mentioned>. <date_mentioned n="07-20-1836">20th Inst</date_mentioned>, on his way to <location_mentioned>Detroit</location_mentioned>, and will probably be
here, some time <date_mentioned n="08-xx-1836">next month</date_mentioned>, and return to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in the <date_mentioned n="Fall-1836">Fall</date_mentioned>—so at least I
<hi rend="italic">understand</hi>—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>here, are daily expecting the answer to the proposed Loan,
from your <person_mentioned>Govrnt</person_mentioned>.— If they do not accept the proposition for the 
remaining $90,000 as <hi rend="italic">stipulated</hi>; It is thought here that the <person_mentioned>Govmt</person_mentioned>. will be
willing to place the 10,000$ paid on the same footing as the <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>
Loan— It was subscribed to by the <person_mentioned>friends of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi>— I
wrote you in relation to it before and also about the <hi rend="italic">Bread </hi>Subscription
or donation, all which, no doubt you have ere this.— I trust your arrival
<location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, will have been in time to render, valuable service to the Cause and<barker_pb n="410"/>
Country— for my own part, I have no apprehensions for the issue of
the 2d Campaign (Should the <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>ever Venture upon it) But you
must <hi rend="italic">keep </hi>up your <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>.— The <person_mentioned>Mexican Govmt</person_mentioned> have discovered that
without a preponderating force on the <location_mentioned>Gulph</location_mentioned>, they can do nothing; and
they will make every effort to obtain It. The next <hi rend="italic">campaign </hi>therefore will
be without doubt a <hi rend="italic">naval one</hi>— Therefore, I think you had always do
well to <hi rend="italic">keep up your naval force</hi>— with this, you have nothing to fear.—
I wrote <person_mentioned>Henry </person_mentioned>by this conveyance— He was last at the <location_mentioned>Springs in 
Virginia</location_mentioned>.— <person_mentioned>John </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Archibald </person_mentioned>both well— All your friends here well—
and think of you often.— Pray write me and give me all the news of
interest.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J. Treat</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] To <person_mentioned>Gen. Stephen F, Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.—</p>
