<p><person_mentioned>Mr John G Bond</person_mentioned></p>

<p>a few days past I rec'd. letters from my friend <person_mentioned>Seth Hunt</person_mentioned>. 
Stateing the substance of an arrangement he had made with you for the
shipment of Lead from this—Country to either <location_mentioned>Philadelphia</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>New
York</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Boston </location_mentioned>as the market shall from time to time answer. It
was my Expectation to have rec'd authority to draw on <location_mentioned>N York</location_mentioned>
however I trust I can so arrange the business that Drafts on <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned>
will answer but with this deference that I must Suffer a Delay untill
information of the Acceptanc of the Drafts are Known in <location_mentioned>lexington</location_mentioned>
the disadvantages resulting from the Bills being drawn on <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned>
I trust will only be felt in the commencement of this business— Its
a great object to have Cash on hand to make the purchase but as I
have it in my Power to make a Shipment from my own funds I
shall do so rather than sell our Draft at a Discount, the <location_mentioned>Bank in
Lexington</location_mentioned> will not take Drafts at 120 Days except at 2 1/2 of 3 p'c
this loss I shall prevent by forwarding my Drafts on to <person_mentioned>Mess. Hart
Barton and Hart <location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and by them to be forwarded to <person_mentioned>frends<barker_pb n="156"/>
in <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for Acceptance. When the Credit of my Drafts are
established I shall Never hereafter meet with difficulty—from my
friend <person_mentioned>Hunt</person_mentioned>s letters I had good reason to expect letters from you
respecting this business, giving directions to whom the Lead should
be ship.d whether to <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I shall make the first shipment to the Care of <person_mentioned>Mess Hart Barton
and Cox <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— Subject to be forward'd either to <location_mentioned>New
York</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Boston </location_mentioned>as you shall order with information in time to have
Insurance made in either place as the case may be—but the risque
from this to <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> can not be cover'd as an <location_mentioned>office of 
Insuran[ce]</location_mentioned> doth not Exist in this Country—</p>

<p>I trust you have a full understanding of this buseness in as much
as my friend <person_mentioned>Hunt </person_mentioned>States in his letters to me, that it is to be don on
the same conditions I stated to him in my letter from <location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned>
<location_mentioned>Shelbyvill </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Lewisvill </location_mentioned>that is the shipments are to be made on
joint account and risque both as it respects Profit and Loss—</p>

<p>Its my Wish that this transaction may be so managed that you
will finde it Your Interest to continue Shipments from this 
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. It will be my Interest to conduct the business in such a way
as to confirm not destroy the good opinion and confidenc my friend
<person_mentioned>Hunt </person_mentioned>has in me, with expectations of information from you on this
Subject and your directions to whom the Shipment will be made
either in <location_mentioned>N York</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>Boston </location_mentioned>I shall prepare and make a Shipment
to <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>

<p>You will be so good as to Write <person_mentioned>Mess Hart Barton and Cox <location_mentioned>New
Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> ordering to whom the shipment from that place will be
made I shall always make my shipments to <person_mentioned>Mess Hart Barton and
Cox</person_mentioned> in the name and for the account of <person_mentioned>John G Bond <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>John G Bond esq</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Keen N Hampshire</location_mentioned></p>
<p><location_mentioned>Saint Genevve</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="05-03-1809">May 3 1809</date_mentioned></p>
