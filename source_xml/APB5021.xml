<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-05-1835">Nov 5th 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Genl</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I would say something of the proceedings of our <person_mentioned>Convention </person_mentioned>were it not
that you will get the most important transactions in the hand bill of the
first days proceedings— <date_mentioned n="11-04-1835">Yesterday</date_mentioned>, however, the day was principally 
occupied in discussion on the resolution offered by <person_mentioned>Mr. Wharton </person_mentioned>appointing a
<person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>"to make a declaration to the world setting forth the reasons for
which we take up arms etc" Though the discussion was lengthy and 
animated yet coolness and moderation pervaded throughout the debate.</p>

<p>Your opinion as to what you believed should be the course to pursue
was introduced as well as several plans all of which were referred to the
<person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>on the subject. Whatever may be the decision it will be 
<hi rend="italic">unanimous</hi>. My opinion is, however, that a large majority will declare for the
principles of the Constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Unanimity and good feeling I believe is the order of the day—and I
trust all will go well.</p>

<p>I am waiting to see what the <person_mentioned>Convention </person_mentioned>will do on the subject of raising
money before I attempt to obtain it on your own account. I believe they
will raise it. They ought to do it I am certain—</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="11-04-1835">Last night</date_mentioned> was a cold and stormy night, and I thought of you and the
<person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>—that perhaps you were in the <location_mentioned>broad prairy</location_mentioned> without cover and 
perhaps destitute of wood. I regret to hear your health is not good; and fear,
the hardships of the <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned>and what is worse, the labor of the mind will
endanger your health.</p>

<p>Had a conversation with <person_mentioned>Genl. Houston</person_mentioned> today—I believe he has the 
interest of <location_mentioned>our country</location_mentioned> at heart. He made the best speech <date_mentioned n="11-04-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>I have
ever heard; the whole tenour of it went to harmonize the feelings of the
<person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>and to produce unanimity of sentiment.</p>

<p>I think there is little doubt of much aid and assistance from the <location_mentioned>United
States</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Had the favor <date_mentioned n="11-05-1835">this evening</date_mentioned> of seeing your letter to <person_mentioned>Dr R Peebles</person_mentioned> in which
you advise to suspend for the present, any farther locations in <location_mentioned>land</location_mentioned>. Little
business has been done in the <location_mentioned>land office</location_mentioned> for some time past, and I can<barker_pb n="239"/>
assure you no advantages has, or will be taken of those who are <location_mentioned>in the
field</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Jack</person_mentioned> however can tell you what has been done. Now on another
subject.</p>

<p>I have written to <person_mentioned>brother Tom</person_mentioned>, that without we had more materials in
our <location_mentioned>printing establishment</location_mentioned>, it was impossible to do work to any extent that
it was all important, as well for ourselves as the interest of the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>to
send an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>immediately to <location_mentioned>N. Orleans </location_mentioned>for the purpose of getting what
articles we want, and extend our subscription list, without a great 
patronage, can not stand the heavy expense of carrying on the <location_mentioned>office</location_mentioned>— We have
sufficient weight of type, but not proportion <person_mentioned>Mr. Baker</person_mentioned> can not be spared,
because he is our only <person_mentioned>translator</person_mentioned>—I can not go for the reasons of my
pressing business, as well of other things, as the improvement of the 
<location_mentioned>printing office</location_mentioned>. This is, therefore, to request you to give <person_mentioned>Thomas </person_mentioned>a furlough so
soon as you think he can be spared that he may go to the <location_mentioned>U S</location_mentioned> for the 
purposes above named. My reason for saying so much to you is, that I 
discovered from his last letter he was determined not to come <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>till after
the campaign; and unless you thought he could better serve the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>by
forwarding our <location_mentioned>printing establishment</location_mentioned>, he would not consent to come from
the <location_mentioned>field</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Excuse me for troubling you with so long a letter, and believe me</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>S. F. Austin Commander in Chief American Army</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>San
Antonio</location_mentioned></p>
