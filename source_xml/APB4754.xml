<p>Civil war threatened. Texas must not participate. Instructions concerning fees claimed by government in first colony

<div1 type="body">

<p><date_mentioned n="04-01-1835">April 1. 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>There seems to be a prospect of another civil war— I hope' the 
<person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>will keep calm and prudent— That state can have no influence in
such a thing</p>

<p>Let them keep peace at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>and stop the disputes with <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned>— <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
as a matter of course, will take no part, whatever, even if it should be
called on by the <person_mentioned>State Govt</person_mentioned> to do so—but I hope it will not be called
on—it ought not to be—</p>

<p>In my last I said that I was told the representation of that <person_mentioned>legislature</person_mentioned>
had been favourably dispatched, and so I was, but I do not know whether
the information was correct or not—so say nothing about it— Try and
get the question finally settled about the pretended claim to fees in my
<location_mentioned>first colony of <person_mentioned>300 families</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> that was set up— That <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>was under the
national law of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1823">1823</date_mentioned>, and the State law of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1825">1825 </date_mentioned>has nothing to do with it—
you can get this settled with the <person_mentioned>Govor</person_mentioned>. by a declaration that no fees are
due as that <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>was not subject to the law of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1825">1825</date_mentioned>— Attend to this
without fail and immediately, and all other matters of interest to me</p>

<p>last mail I sent you an order on <person_mentioned>Dr. Grant</person_mentioned> for 200 Dolls, which he owes
on a draft from <person_mentioned>Parrott</person_mentioned>, in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1833">1833 </date_mentioned>which I sent him by <person_mentioned>John Erwin</person_mentioned>, but
never recd. the money</p>

<p>There has been no change in my situation. I am still on bail, and no
prospect of any change soon—</p>

<p>Keep clear of civil wars—</p>

<p>[Stephen F. Austin]</p>
<p>[To Samuel M. Williams, Monclova]</p>
