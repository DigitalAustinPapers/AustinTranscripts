<p>To preserve good order in the <location_mentioned>colony </location_mentioned>under my charge, I have
been compelled to cause five men to leave it, with their <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>,
to wit: <person_mentioned>Briton Baylie</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>John M Coy</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Alen White</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>David Fitzgerald</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Daniel O. Quin</person_mentioned>. They are all men of infamous character and
bad conduct, <person_mentioned>fugitives from the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, one for having 
committed murder, the others for having counterfeited money, and for
whose apprehension the <person_mentioned>American Government</person_mentioned> has offered high
rewards Men of such a stamp can not but be prejudicial to this
<location_mentioned>new settlement</location_mentioned>; therefore, I hope that my action will meet your
high approbation.</p>

<p>To prevent, hereafter, the introduction into this <location_mentioned>Colony </location_mentioned>of men
of that kind, I shall be compelled to keep up a rigid and active
police; which measure, I think, will also be approved by you.</p>

<p<person_mentioned>>Estevan F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>.
