<p>To <person_mentioned>Andrew Jackson</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Martin Van Buren</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Richard M. Johnson</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>John
Forsyth</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Lewis Cass</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>T. H. Benton</person_mentioned>, and to <person_mentioned>any member of the
Cabinet or Congress of all parties and all factions of the
<location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="04-15-1836">April 15th. 1836.</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Pardon me this intrusion upon your valued time. I address you as 
Individuals, as men, as <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>, as my <person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned>. I obey an honest though
an excited impulse.</p>

<p>We have recent dates from <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>by the Packet. It Appears that
<person_mentioned>Santana </person_mentioned>has succeeded in uniting the whole of the <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
by making it a national war against heretics: that an additional army of
<person_mentioned>8000 men</person_mentioned> is organizing in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>under <person_mentioned>Gen. Cortazar</person_mentioned> to march to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
and exterminate the <hi rend="italic">heretic Americans</hi>. <person_mentioned>Santana </person_mentioned>is now in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, as we
all know, with about <person_mentioned>7000 men</person_mentioned> fighting under the <hi rend="italic">bloody </hi>flag of a <person_mentioned>Pirate</person_mentioned>—
he is exciting the <person_mentioned>Comanches </person_mentioned>and other <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, who know nothing of laws
or political divisions of <location_mentioned>territory</location_mentioned>, and massacres have been committed on
<location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned> within the<location_mentioned> U.S.</location_mentioned> This is a war of barbarism against civilization,
of despotism against liberty, of <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>against <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>. Oh my 
<person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned>! the warm hearted chivalrous impulsive <location_mentioned>West </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>South </location_mentioned>are up
and moving in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. The calculating and more prudent tho' not
less noble minded <location_mentioned>North </location_mentioned>are aroused. The Sympathies of the whole 
<person_mentioned>American people</person_mentioned> in mass are with the <person_mentioned>Texians</person_mentioned>. This people look to you the
guardians of their rights and interests and principles. Will you, can you
turn a deaf ear to the appeals of your <person_mentioned>fellow citizens</person_mentioned> in favor of your and
their <person_mentioned>countrymen </person_mentioned>and friends who are massacred, butchered, outraged in
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>at your very doors? Are not <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, the <person_mentioned>Texians </person_mentioned>obeying the dictates
of an education received here: from you the <person_mentioned>American people</person_mentioned>, from our
<person_mentioned>fathers</person_mentioned>, from the <person_mentioned>patriots of 76</person_mentioned>— the <person_mentioned>Republicans of 1836</person_mentioned>? Have we not
been stimulated to obey the dictates of this noble education by the 
expression of opinions all over the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> and by all <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>that we ought
to resist and throw off the yoke of <person_mentioned>Mexican </person_mentioned>usurpation, and are we now
to be abandoned or suffered to struggle alone and single handed, because
the cold calculations of policy or of party have had to be consulted?</p><barker_pb n="333"/>

<p>Well, you reply—what can we do? In answer I say, let the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Cabinet </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>come out openly and at once and proclaim to
the public their opinions—let <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>have some of the $37,000,000 now in
the <location_mentioned>national treasury</location_mentioned>—let the war in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>become a <hi rend="italic">National war, above
board</hi>, and thus respond to the noble feelings of the <person_mentioned>American people</person_mentioned>—
Who can deny that it is a national war in reality—a war in which every
<person_mentioned>free American</person_mentioned> who is not a <person_mentioned>fanatic</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>abolitionist</person_mentioned>, or cold hearted recreant
to the interest and honor and principles of his <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned>,
who is not an icicle in soul and in practice, is deeply, warmly ardently 
interested. In short, it is <hi rend="italic">now </hi>a national war <hi rend="italic">subrosa </hi>This will not do;
This state of the matter cannot, ought not to continue— make it <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">above board,</hi> what it is <hi rend="italic">in fact, a national war</hi> in defence of national
rights interests and principles and of <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>. Let the <person_mentioned>Administration</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>take this position <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, and the butcheries in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will
cease, humanity will no longer be outraged by a war of extermination
against liberty and against <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>— peace will be restored and 
maintained on the <location_mentioned>South West frontiers of this nation</location_mentioned>, and the <person_mentioned>Government of
the U.S.</person_mentioned> will then occupy that open and elevated place which is due to the
<person_mentioned>American people</person_mentioned> and worthy of <person_mentioned>Andrew Jackson</person_mentioned>—for it will occupy <hi rend="italic">above
board</hi> the position which this <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>as a people now occupy in the heart
and in feeling and in wishes; a position which they are now defending in
obedience to the noblest impulses of the heart, by acts and with their blood,
as warm hearts noble spirits always do.</p>

<p>Respectfully your <person_mentioned>native countryman</person_mentioned> and obedt Sert.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F Austin</person_mentioned> of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>
