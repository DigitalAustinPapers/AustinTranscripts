<p><person_mentioned>Gen. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>

<p>My dear Sir.</p>

<p>Enclosed I send you press Copy of part of my last letter to you, in 
regard of the <location_mentioned>"Correo Atlantico"</location_mentioned> which as you will see has been silenced for
want of the needful, thus giving to the <person_mentioned>enemies of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> a full sway to say
what they think proper, without meeting with a Contradiction— I have
forwarded regular files of the <location_mentioned>Correo Atlantico</location_mentioned> to the <location_mentioned>"Times"</location_mentioned> and 
<location_mentioned>"Morning Post" London</location_mentioned>.—<location_mentioned>"Gallignani's Messenger" Paris</location_mentioned>,—<location_mentioned>"Boersenhallen
Liste"</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>"Correspondent" Hamburg</location_mentioned>—and <location_mentioned>"Algemeine Zeitung" 
Augsburg</location_mentioned>— Thus you may shortly see the <location_mentioned>European Papers</location_mentioned> teaming with the
Cause of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and deprecating the butcheries and barbarities of <person_mentioned>Santa
Anna</person_mentioned>.— It is necessary to enlist the sympathies of the <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>french</person_mentioned>
people in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and we are succeeding in it to my best 
expectations. The troubles and difficulties of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are by far not over yet, and
it is necessary to call the sympathising aid of <location_mentioned>Europe </location_mentioned>in its favor.— This
afternoon I am going to put on board Steamer Teche for <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>, 
<location_mentioned>Cincinnati </location_mentioned>&c: and am Yours truly</p>

<p><person_mentioned>George Fisher</person_mentioned></p>
