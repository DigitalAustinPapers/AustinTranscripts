<p><location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-17-1810">May 17th 1810</date_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Dr Stephen</person_mentioned></p>

<p>You must excuse my not writing sooner, agreeable to promise but
I must plead want of time as my excuse- I went to <location_mentioned>Shepherdsville</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>Bairdstown </location_mentioned>after I left you at <location_mentioned>Louisville </location_mentioned>and returned home by
<location_mentioned>Shelbyville </location_mentioned>very much pleased with my trip- I met <person_mentioned>George Shannon</person_mentioned>
at <location_mentioned>Shelbyville </location_mentioned>and stayed a day or so with him. There is no news
here as usual except that I saw <person_mentioned>Eliza P.</person_mentioned> this morning, the little
girl you are so fond of, and I am very happy in letting you know
she was in a very good state of health; <person_mentioned>Mrs. Nat Hart </person_mentioned>has a <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned>
and has been very ill for several weeks but is now rather on the
mend. I got a Letter from <person_mentioned>Tho Butler</person_mentioned> at <location_mentioned>Massac </location_mentioned>this <date_mentioned n="05-17-1810">Morning </date_mentioned>he
intends Coming up this month, to see his friends and I think 
probably he will resign at least I think he is wrong if he does not for
he is now spending his time for nothing: I intend quitting <person_mentioned>Mrs.
Bodley</person_mentioned> in about six weeks and turn in to studying Law like a house
afire, for I have already spent my time with very little 
Consideration- I wish I had known two or three years ago the value of time
as well as I do now and I am sure I should have made a much
better use of it- A Young man knows not the value of time untill
it is past and then he sees his error.</p>

<p>I seen <person_mentioned>Betsey </person_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-16-1810">yesterday </date_mentioned>but she was so guarded by her <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>that I Could get no Opportunity of speaking to her. I
however intend making a movement Some of these days that shall
astonish all of them, there is nothing like acting with decision in
those Cases and I am very much mistaken if they dont experience
Some of it shortly. I then intend Coming down some where in
the <location_mentioned>Lower Country</location_mentioned> and try my fortune I hope you will not neglect
writing the first Opportunity or as soon as this Comes to hand; All
your <person_mentioned>Old Schoolmates</person_mentioned> or a good Many are going to the <location_mentioned>University</location_mentioned>
again.</p>

<p>If you see any of my old <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>down Your way give my respects
to them and believe me</p>
