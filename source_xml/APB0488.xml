<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>We arrived here on the <date_mentioned n="03-21-1822">21 </date_mentioned>and finding that a considerable 
<person_mentioned>Company </person_mentioned>were going on to <location_mentioned>La Punta</location_mentioned>, on Sunday afternoon I thought
it most prudent to wait for them, on acount of the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, who
are very numerous on all these roads,—about <location_mentioned>six miles this side of
the river Nuesis</location_mentioned> 50 <person_mentioned>Camanches </person_mentioned>charged upon us a little before sun
rise, the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Waters </person_mentioned>were out after the Horses and I was
alone at <location_mentioned>Camp</location_mentioned>, they surrounded me in an instant and took possession
of every article we had—resistance was useless for against so many
it would have been ineffectual the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Waters </person_mentioned>and the Horses
were soon brought up by the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>and I then expostulated with
them for treating their <person_mentioned>Friends </person_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>in such a manner,—
when they found there was no <person_mentioned>Spaniards </person_mentioned>with me, they gave us back
our Saddle bags, saddles, and everything else except 4 blankets, a
bridle, my Grammar and Several other little things and all our 
provisons, nothing saved our lives but being <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>, and as the next
party might not be so polite I have waited for the <person_mentioned>company </person_mentioned>that is
going on <date_mentioned n="03-14-1822">to morrow</date_mentioned>. Two men were taken <person_mentioned>prisoners</person_mentioned>, the day <date_mentioned n="03-11-1822">before
yesterday</date_mentioned> within a few miles of this place, one of whom escaped and
got in this <date_mentioned n="03-13-1822">morning </date_mentioned>he says the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>are waylaying the road 
between this and <location_mentioned>Punta</location_mentioned>, (the road I am going)—about 3 miles this
side of where the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>charged upon us, we met another <person_mentioned>party</person_mentioned>
of 34 who were encamped behind a hill watching the road, only two
of them came to us, they said their <person_mentioned>captain </person_mentioned>knew us to be 
<person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and ordered his men to let us alone.</p>

<p>The Country from the <location_mentioned>River Madina</location_mentioned> to this place is the poorest
I ever saw in my life, it is generally nothing but Sand, entirely void
of Timber, covered with scrubby thorn bushes and Prickly Pear—
this place is on the<location_mentioned> bank of the Rio Grande</location_mentioned>—and is as poor as sand
banks, and drought, and indolence can make it—The <location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>is about
the size of the <location_mentioned>Arkansas</location_mentioned>, if anything a little larger—</p>

<p>I hope you are applying yourself closely to Study—get the first
volume of Dufiefs (?) Grammar from the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>and Study the
familiar phrases and lessons, and write them, also after commiting
a verb write it from memory and then compare it with the book to
see that the spelling is correct—also repeat your verbs as you learn
them to <person_mentioned>Francisco </person_mentioned>or some other who can correct your 
pronunciation, a bad pronunciation at the start will be difficult to correct,
therefore take no lessions [sic] from any but those who are capable
of giving them—Remember that it is all important to learn to write
the language—</p><barker_pb n="488"/>

<p>Pray be particular in taking care of your things—The tent, 
Blankets, Kittle, Pack Saddle, the two bridles, and every other article
however trifling it may seem to be.</p>
<p>Write me directed to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>,</p>
<p>Your affc <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>
