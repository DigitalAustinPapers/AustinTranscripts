<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Company </person_mentioned>which I spoke of at <location_mentioned>Portsmouth</location_mentioned>, thinking that the war was
over had almost determined not to go to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but my own opinion is,
that the heaviest burdthen is yet to come, I have taken some measures to
induce them to go.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">I have</hi> proposed to raise <person_mentioned>one hundred men</person_mentioned>, <hi rend="italic">and pay their</hi> expenses out,
and arm them. If I understood <hi rend="italic">you </hi>right, the money which I expend in
taking them from <location_mentioned>Norfolk </location_mentioned>'"will be repaid by the <person_mentioned>Texian Government</person_mentioned>."

received at <location_mentioned>head quarters</location_mentioned></p>.

<p>If I can get a schooner or small Brigg at <location_mentioned>Norfolk</location_mentioned>, at a fair price I think
I shall purchase it and if the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>can arm it I will put it in service,
after carrying out my men from here.</p>

my <person_mentioned>compliment of men</person_mentioned> by the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th of July</date_mentioned> and would like to start by the
<date_mentioned n="07-20-1836">20th</date_mentioned> any other information which you think I may need send it. I shall
have some of the first young men in the country.</p>

<p>If I purchase a vessel I shall not have funds of my own, with your 
assurance of the <hi rend="italic">sanction </hi>of the <person_mentioned>government</person_mentioned>, I will be able to get the money
(write me at <location_mentioned>Norfolk</location_mentioned>.)</p>
