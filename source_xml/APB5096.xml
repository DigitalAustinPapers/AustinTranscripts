<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="01-07-1836">Jan 7, 1836</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you soon, but it is not certain, as
I may not be able to visit <location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned>until I return from the <location_mentioned>Eastward </location_mentioned>as
we are very much pressed for time. I am bound to <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned>
etc. in company with <person_mentioned>Docr. B. T. Archer</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>W. H. Wharton Esqr.</person_mentioned> We
are <person_mentioned>commissioners for the Texan Government</person_mentioned>. Our principal object is to
raise money means and <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>to sustain our cause.</p>

<p>The War for Liberty goes on prosperously, so far, in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. It must,
and will, end in Independence—<hi rend="italic">a full Declaration</hi> will be made in <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1836">March</date_mentioned>.
That of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1836">7th November</date_mentioned> was the first step, preparatory to the second and
final one. The fact is, we have no other remedy left. By the last accounts
the <person_mentioned>Central Government</person_mentioned> is established, and the <hi rend="italic">Federal </hi>system totally 
destroyed. The <person_mentioned>Texans </person_mentioned>may, therefore, for the future, be considered an 
<person_mentioned>independent people</person_mentioned>, intirely separate from <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>. We are young to set up for
ourselves, but we are the sons of that <location_mentioned>great nation</location_mentioned> which has astonished the
world by its deeds, and progress in the cause of liberty, light and truth.
When I left <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>there was not an <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>within our limits, nor <location_mentioned>east of
the River Bravo del Norte</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Gen. Santanna</person_mentioned>, however, is marching on in
person with all the <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>he can collect to <hi rend="italic">anihilate </hi>us. We have no fears,
but we must be ready for him. We need all the aid we can get in <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>and
money, provisions, arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>Large contributions have been made in the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> for the 
extension of Christianity over the <location_mentioned>South Sea Islands</location_mentioned> by means of <person_mentioned>Missionary
societies</person_mentioned>. Is not our cause quite as important and sacred? We are trying
to banish from our <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>religious intolerance and despotism, and to
establish in the place of it, liberty and freedom of conscience. How many
thousands of pious <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>of all denominations might find a home and
become the proprietors of the soil in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—the best soil and climate
accessible to <person_mentioned>north Americans</person_mentioned>—if religious toleration were once firmly
rooted there! Religion, morality, the arts and sciences, the great sources<barker_pb n="301"/>
of liberty—which is in fact, the cause of mankind—all unite in calling
upon the free, the generous, the enterprising and the pious, to step forward
in aid of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. We expect aid from the <person_mentioned>religious portion of the 
community</person_mentioned>, and that the <location_mentioned>pulpit </location_mentioned>will pour out its fervent prayers to a just God
for his blessing on our endeavors, and send its eloquent voice to the people
in the cause of all free churches—the cause of truth and justice.</p>

<p>Our fate will probably be decided in three months. <person_mentioned>Santanna </person_mentioned>is making
a great effort. If he fail, it must be his last. Now is the time to aid us—
now is the time of salvation. We need everything—provisions and money—
and men well armed, officered, and provided. Their expenses will all be
refunded at the close of the war, with interest, besides donations in <location_mentioned>land</location_mentioned>,
The opening is a great one, if it were only a matter of speculation—it is
glorious in its cause. A <location_mentioned>new republic</location_mentioned> is about to rear its independent
banner over a country but lately a <location_mentioned>wilderness</location_mentioned>— There is magnificence in
the idea—prosperity freedom and glory in the results.</p>

<p>We shall stop one day at <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>. I should like much to visit 
<location_mentioned>Lexington</location_mentioned>. Some of my much cherished <person_mentioned>schoolmates </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>companions </person_mentioned>of happy
days still reside there: <person_mentioned>John McCalla</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Pierce Butler</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Todds</person_mentioned> etc. please
remember me to them. Tell my <person_mentioned>Cousins E_________ and H____________</person_mentioned>
I hope it will not be long before they can live in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>with such comforts
as they merit. If we weather the storm untill <date_mentioned n="06-xx-1836">June </date_mentioned>all will end well and
prosperously. I have no doubt we shall, for we rely on aid from the
<person_mentioned>people of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—<hi rend="italic">but it must be prompt.</hi></p>

<p>There is a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Louisiana </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned>; a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Georgia </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned>; a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>
Battalion</person_mentioned>; an <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Alabama </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned>; and a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Tennessee </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned>; why can
there not be a <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned>? It would be a fine opening for a 
<person_mentioned>military man of standing</person_mentioned>—a <location_mentioned>Lafayette </location_mentioned>service. They might go by land from
<location_mentioned>Natchitoches</location_mentioned>, or by water from here. The former I prefer, as <person_mentioned>Mexican</person_mentioned>
cruisers are <location_mentioned>on the coast</location_mentioned>. We are fitting out some to meet them, but our
money is rather short.</p>

<p>I have written hastily and must close, for I am at the end of the paper,
but not at the end of the subject. It is a copious one, and I am perhaps
rather enthusiastic in the view I take of it. My whole heart and soul is
devoted to it. I am well.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A</person_mentioned>.</p>
