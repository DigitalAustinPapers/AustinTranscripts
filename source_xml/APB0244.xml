<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having lost my <person_mentioned>partner Mr Cox</person_mentioned> some time ago, I address you
in my own name, and reply to your favor of the <date_mentioned n="01-02-1814">2nd last month</date_mentioned>, 
received two days ago, Stating your being interested in the making
of Shot and roll lead, <hi rend="italic">both </hi>are in demand, but even our present
high rates, would not pay carriage from <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>and during the
war, we have no Safe water Conveyance, from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>—
$20 per hundred has been paid for Cotton to the <location_mentioned>northern States</location_mentioned>
and I presume full that would be ask'd from <location_mentioned>Nashville </location_mentioned>to this—
the present price is 18 to $20 for Shot and rolls, and when peace,
will drop to 12@ 15$. The Sizes of Shot most Saleable are
from the Size above mustard to BB viz Bird, Snipe, High duck
and Bristol Blue for Turkeys—with some Buck of moderate Size,
the rolls are generally in demand, the pig or bars are now got in
our own State, but not of a very good quality and but little used—I
regret that I cannot give better encouragement to industry—if any
favorable change I will drop you a line on the Subject—</p>
<p>Respectfully am Sir</p>
