<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Friend</person_mentioned>                              <location_mentioned>Hercm</location_mentioned>. <date_mentioned n="04-05-1819">April 5, 1819</date_mentioned></p>

<p>contrary to my expectations I am still in this country, tho just
on the wing, I shall commence loading my Boat <date_mentioned n="05-06-1819">tomorrow </date_mentioned>or next
day, and hope to start on <date_mentioned n="05-08-1819">Saturday </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="05-09-1819">Sunday morning</date_mentioned>—the 150
Dollars I will send you before I stark—</p>

<p>I am in great sperits as to getting the <location_mentioned>seat of Government at
little Rock</location_mentioned>— you may rest assured no exertions of mine shall be
wanting, one principle thing however is an <hi rend="italic">order of Survey</hi>— I
wrote you on this Subject by <person_mentioned>R. Andrews</person_mentioned>, and wish if possible he
could be appointed the deputy— have you heard anything from
<person_mentioned>T. Rector</person_mentioned> since his return that will be interesting? have you
seen the law for <location_mentioned>Arkansaw Territory</location_mentioned> ? if you have any paper that
has it, please send it to me— do you know who are to be <person_mentioned>officers
in that <location_mentioned>Territory</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> &c—</p>

<p>My <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>has purchased <hi rend="italic">much </hi>Bank Stock and will be up 
immediately after my departure, the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>held him to most <hi rend="italic">unreasonable
bail</hi>, such conduct in them is inexplicable to me. my <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>have been amongst the firmest supporters the Bank ever had,
and now to be ruined by its oppression I think is ungenerous, if
the money my <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>owes was <hi rend="italic">all paid</hi> in at once, would it remain
in the vaults? or would it be lent out again?—it certainly would
be loaned out— if then he can make them <hi rend="italic">safe </hi>(which he has
already done) why not let the loan stand, or must <hi rend="italic">he </hi>be ruined to
satisfy some others who wish to borrow money ?— if the <person_mentioned>Directors</person_mentioned>
are governed by <hi rend="italic">that </hi>principle they need not calculate to have
<person_mentioned>Friends </person_mentioned>long of any kind, <hi rend="italic">but Shavers</hi>— one of my first objects
when I get below will be to get a <hi rend="italic">Bank </hi>under way which I have good
prospects of expecting, it then may be in our power to befriend and
aid the <person_mentioned>St Louis Bank</person_mentioned> most materially in the circulation of its notes—
if however it is to become an instrument of oppression to ruin men
without necessity—I shall wash <hi rend="italic">my </hi>hands of it, and endeavor to give
it the <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Standing </hi>in that Country which it will <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
merit My <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>has nearly Stock enough to cover our debt at <hi rend="italic">Par</hi>,
which will be transfered into his name when he comes up and pledged
in addition to his mortgage if required— have you heard from
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Price</person_mentioned></hi>, or <person_mentioned>Barton</person_mentioned>, and what are the <hi rend="italic">hopes</hi>, We are <hi rend="italic">now </hi>more 
interested than ever in the fate of the <person_mentioned>Bank </person_mentioned>and what you communicate to
me shall be <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>—</p>

<p>Compliments to your <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Lady </person_mentioned>and believe me to be your</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr. W. M. Ohara</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned></p>
