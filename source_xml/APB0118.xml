unquestionably you will derive much satisfaction from it—You have
ample means to do these Things, in my Opinion, my Friend, nothing
should prevent me from doing it—It will close the mouths of many
complaining Persons—If you could form one other resolution and<barker_pb n="131"/>

in peace and quietness—that is, under all circumstances and in all
situations do your duty and command yourself, if things work ever
so contrary and perverse, dont give way to your Passions, but make
the best of it—every thing can be effected by resolution—this mode
of conduct is the most satisfying you may depend—I know by

interest in your welfare—I have recd. no order from you for <person_mentioned>Mr.

I had also taken some from his parcels thank fortune there was
enough left to pay <person_mentioned>Burns</person_mentioned>'s order—therefore if <person_mentioned>Perkins </person_mentioned>dont call
