<p>My Dear <person_mentioned>Son </person_mentioned>[in New Orleans]</p>

<p>When I wrote you last I was under very great apprehension of
the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>and I did truly think that we should have a visit from
them in a few days—but things have changed and I am now 
satisfied that we are safe, great exertions have been made, and many
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>called out, and are now out on the <location_mentioned>frontier</location_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>that
threatened this <location_mentioned>Territory </location_mentioned>have retired back to [the] <location_mentioned>Wilds of the
North</location_mentioned>, and the <person_mentioned>Troops on the <location_mentioned>North of the Meremac</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> I think 
sufficient to keep them on <location_mentioned>that Side of the River</location_mentioned>. I have seen an account
of a most deadful storm in <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, that has don[e] much damages
you will write me an a/c in your next I have also seen an account
of <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>being landed in <location_mentioned>St Augustine</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Pensacola </location_mentioned>in excellant
order and under the command of <person_mentioned>British officers</person_mentioned>, and that great
apprehensions existed in consequence of many <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>running away,
and, joining the <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>Standard. Should this be true, I have a
desire that you leave a <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>where you will be in greater danger
from <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>than we are from <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>, but of this you will be the
better Judge. As much as I apprehend danger from <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>in the
<location_mentioned>low Country</location_mentioned>, I wish I had 50 more at the <location_mentioned>mines </location_mentioned>I could make the
value of them this year in the state the <location_mentioned>mines </location_mentioned>are in and I have 
Supposed that you could make yourself acquainted how they may be
obtained in <location_mentioned>Carolina </location_mentioned>from <person_mentioned>Mr Hampton</person_mentioned>, and If you could by any
contract obtain 10, or 12, payable in <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>. It would make a great
alteration in our business— You must be carefull in puting your
cargo in <location_mentioned>Orleans </location_mentioned>for sale and the price of the Shott will be 
determined by the Order of your cargo, may be when presented for sale,
I have mentioned that I should make ready an Other cargo of sheet
lead and that you had better stay untill It arrived, this I still think,
for the best and had not the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>have put a stop to every kind of
business I should have had the Cargo of [f] before this time I shall
make exertions to forward it to you so as to arrive in all next month,
and I think you had better attend untill that time.   .   .</p>
