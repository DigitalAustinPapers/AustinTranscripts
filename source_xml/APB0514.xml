<p><date_mentioned n="05-31-1822">May 31. 1822</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have wrote you so repeatedly and so fully that I have some
difficulty in determining what subject now to undertake.</p>

<p>You will have visited <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>at a most eventful and Auspicious
moment—</p>

<p>Have things resulted as you desired? Do they now stand on a
sane and permanent basis?</p>

<p>I send you a letter inclosed directed to myself—It is from <person_mentioned>Rielly</person_mentioned>
at <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>-—open and read it.</p>

<p>He could not comprehend why I recommended<person_mentioned> Ervine [Erwin]</person_mentioned>
and his views—I wrote you fully on this subject—I took a share in
<person_mentioned>E's Compy</person_mentioned>. It was necessary to do so—They would have left here
otherwise with feelings of hostility—</p>

<p>I have a written stipulation that my membership and agency was
recd with a knowledge of my interest in your <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>, and that nothing
was desired or expected not promotive of your interests. The fact
is that their success is yours—As to the respective value of the
grants, that will depend on local advantages—To make <person_mentioned>Carrol </person_mentioned>and
others <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>who were to be our <person_mentioned>neighbors </person_mentioned>was no small affair—
Having mentioned <person_mentioned>Carroll</person_mentioned>s names it is necessary to remind you He
has been and will continue our friend—and wishes to be our 
<person_mentioned>neighbour</person_mentioned>—You will provide for him accordingly—</p>

<p>I told <person_mentioned>Genl. <hi rend="italic">R </hi></person_mentioned>... on <date_mentioned n="05-30-1822">yesterday </date_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Genl. Trespalacios</person_mentioned> had no
ground or cause of Complaint agt you or your friends, and that I
blamed him <person_mentioned>R</person_mentioned>, with the bad feelings (if any now existed) which
might be displayed—</p>

<p>I hope most sincerely you had an opportunity of meeting <person_mentioned>Genl. 
Trespalacios</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>. I need make no comments on the facts disclosed
by the letter from <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>—</p><barker_pb n="521"/>

<p>There will be men around <person_mentioned>Gl. T</person_mentioned>—who would gladly injure you—
You need no admonition from me on this subject—Your good sense
and firmness will point out the Course</p>

<p>I have received very many letters to you—all of which I have
opened and read Some you [I] have sent by the <hi rend="italic">Only Son </hi>The rest
I retain and shall answer for you in the most laconic manner to be
civil—The business is becoming too <hi rend="italic">weighty </hi>to be prolix.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to repeat—our disbursements now exceed
$7,000—including the provisions shipped, and my interest in the
<hi rend="italic">Only Son </hi>I was compelled to sell one half—the vessel, and may be
forced to sell the other.</p>

<p>This is of no moment should success attend your efforts—It would
afford me sincere gratification to say when and where we could meet—
I would even go to you—could I be assured that all was well.</p>

<p>The glimmerings of hope sometimes break in upon me, and the
visions are almost golden—I do [not] mean the sordid acquisition of
wealth—but release from debt in other words freedom—To die a
<person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>would be insupportable—To leave as the only legacy to my
<person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">hungry <person_mentioned>creditors</person_mentioned></hi> would be to have lived in vain and die
miserable</p>

<p>I have pursuaded <person_mentioned>Mrs Hawkins</person_mentioned> to look to and rely on you as the
firmest pillar in our <hi rend="italic">building</hi>—She speaks of you in kindness but
sometimes says she expects to upbraid you with having taken her
<person_mentioned>Husband </person_mentioned>from the only sure path for him—his trade- I am much
pressed for time and the <person_mentioned>Capt of the vessel</person_mentioned> has called.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J H Hawkins</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Judge S F Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>This will be delivered you by <person_mentioned>Mr Beardslee</person_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Brother of the
Editor of the advitiser</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>He is an amiable Young Man—in delicate health—I have induced
him to go to the <location_mentioned>Province </location_mentioned>for the <date_mentioned n="Summer-1822">summer</date_mentioned>— He will live with my
<person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>or yourself—Your attention to him will oblige me—He will
be without means—Occupation will be desirable</p>
