<p><location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="06-27-1836">Monday 27 June 36</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>After rolling at anchor nearly all day I have just landed— My head still
has the sea sick motion, so I can say but a few words in reply to your 
request, in your note to the <person_mentioned>president</person_mentioned>, to give you the news from the <location_mentioned>U.S.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>There is a general and pritty universal and ardent interest <location_mentioned>all over the
U.S.</location_mentioned> in favor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— This feeling pervades both houses of <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>
and the <person_mentioned>cabinet</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I believe that nothing was wanting to procure a recognition of our 
independence but <hi rend="italic">official manuscript accounts</hi> of the battle of <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> and
the actual state of things in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—Some proof of our capacity to sustain
ourselves etc. Nothing of the kind was rec'd—nothing but <location_mentioned>newspaper </location_mentioned>
accounts had reached there when I left.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Collingsworth </person_mentioned>took accounts to <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> that no more
<person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>were needed. This will do great harm and must be immediately
counteracted if we expect any more aid from there.</p>

<p>The reports about treating with <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> etc have injured the cause
of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>beyond anything you can conceive of.</p>

<p>Our course now appears to be a plain one. The <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>must rally
<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> and meet the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>. It seems that their creed is extermination.
If so, ought we to have faith in such an <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>or to extend mercy or favors?</p>

<p>A great error (as I think) has been committed in not communicating
with the <person_mentioned>agents of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. I recommend that a report
or an account in an official form be sent to them by every opportunity of
every important event that transpires.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>80 men</person_mentioned> ought to be at <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="06-28-1836">tomorrow </date_mentioned>in the schooner San Jacinto
from <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>—the <person_mentioned>men are from <location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> commanded by <person_mentioned>Capt. Allen</person_mentioned>,
a fine fellow. <person_mentioned>300 </person_mentioned>more are on the way from <location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>1000 </person_mentioned>more would have been on—but the report that "the war is ended" will
stop them.</p><barker_pb n="373"/>

<p>In Gods name no more armistices or treaties with <person_mentioned>prisoners</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>In the <location_mentioned>Mississippi </location_mentioned>I saw a vessel direct from <location_mentioned>Matamoros </location_mentioned>which confirms
the news rec'd here as to the advance of the <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>10,000 to <person_mentioned>12,000
</person_mentioned>strong. There is no doubt of it—all <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>is in motion. No treaty made
with <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> will be respected by them. <person_mentioned>Gen Urrea</person_mentioned> is <person_mentioned>commander in
chief</person_mentioned>.<person_mentioned> Gen Cortazar</person_mentioned> was at <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>5000 men</person_mentioned> and coming on by
forced marches. <person_mentioned>Gen Filisolo</person_mentioned> had rec'd orders to halt his retreat and
fight etc. Such is the substance of the news from <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>—also that
an <person_mentioned>expedition </person_mentioned>was fitting out by water. I shall try and be with you in the
<person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>as soon as I can, as a <person_mentioned>private soldier</person_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>every man in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> must
shoulder his arms. Farewell</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen M B Lamar</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Majr Gen. M. B. Lamar</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Permit me to suggest that it would be best to avoid (if possible) any
harsh treatment towards <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s person. In the present 
excitement perhaps this will be difficult, tho. you know more of the <hi rend="italic">temper of the
times</hi> than I do as to the matter.</p>
