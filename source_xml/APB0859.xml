<p>Dr Sir, I take the liberty of addressing a few lines to you, hoping
they will find you in good health, and enjoying the satisfaction of
seeing your infant <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>in prosperity.—great numbers are 
going out from this State and the <location_mentioned>Mississippi </location_mentioned>to view that country, and
no doubt you will have a very strong settlement in a short time. I
should be glad to hear whether those who went on an exploring 
expedition, on board the Schooner Lively, and found themselves 
everything are entitled to lands there or not; notwithstanding they should
remain here; for this season; some of them are in a situation that
prevents them from moving to that country immediately, and the
good lands may all be taken up, and deprive them of a choice; if
so, you will confer an obligation on me, by letting me know, and 
having mine confirmed, and forwarded to me,—</p>

<p>I take the liberty of introducing to your acquaintance, <person_mentioned>Mr. Luman
Phelps</person_mentioned>, one of the number who went out on board the Lively and
found himself everything and remained on the <location_mentioned>Brassos</location_mentioned>; he is a young
gentleman of great integrity and industry, and no doubt will do
well, and has an idea of settleing himself there;—I hope this will
find you in health, peace, and prosperity;—Please to accept of the
good wishes of your friend—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Francis P. Wall</person_mentioned></p>

<p>To the <person_mentioned>Hon. Stephen F. Austin Esqr</person_mentioned>.</p>
