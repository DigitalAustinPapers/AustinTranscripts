<p><location_mentioned>Philadelphia </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="06-23-1812">June the 23</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Notwithstanding I wrote my much beloved <person_mentioned>Husband</person_mentioned>, on the,
<date_mentioned n="06-22-1812">22—Inst.</date_mentioned> Informing him of the Declaration of War—the great
Anxiety of my mind is such I must again take up my pen, to beg and
Intreat you not to be lulled into a fatal Security that there is no
danger to be apprehended from the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>—oh my loveing <person_mentioned>Husd</person_mentioned>.
my pen is Inadiquate to the task of Describeing the distress of my
mind on this Subject and the danger of my <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned>s Voyage, I think
he has had time to Arrive in <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> Provided he has met with
no delays, but oh two well I know the great Uncertainty of a passage
from <location_mentioned>N Orleans</location_mentioned> to the <location_mentioned>Atlantic States</location_mentioned> and if he is so Unfortunate
as to be detained at the <location_mentioned>Mouth of the river</location_mentioned>, as I was, it will be a
Maracal, if he Escapes being taken—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Commode. Roggers</person_mentioned> went out the day the <person_mentioned>Express </person_mentioned>arrived in <location_mentioned>N Y</location_mentioned> -
and the next day brought in a <person_mentioned>British Merchantman</person_mentioned>—this will give
the Allarm and in a short time we may Expect their armed Vessels
from <location_mentioned>Hallifax </location_mentioned>on our <location_mentioned>Co[a]st</location_mentioned>, who will Capture every <person_mentioned>american</person_mentioned>
Vessel theay can find—on the other hand if he is so fortunate as to
Escape, his Cargo will turn out well, as lead is at this time foreteen
dollars pr Hundred this together with what you could send up the
<location_mentioned>Ohio </location_mentioned>would secure a Sufficiency in case you should be Obligh'd to
Abandon the <location_mentioned>Mines</location_mentioned>—which if one half is true, that is Stated in the
papers, you must sertainly do—if you have any regard to your one
[own] safety—and oh my dear <person_mentioned>Husband </person_mentioned>what will become of my

<person_mentioned>famaly </person_mentioned>in short the hole <location_mentioned>Neighbourhood </location_mentioned>will be Exposed to savage
Barbarity—it tis a Meloncholy truth that the <person_mentioned>Indian tribes</person_mentioned> boath on
the <location_mentioned>Mississippi</location_mentioned>—<location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Wabash</location_mentioned>, are only wateing for the
Prophet to give the word—to Commece hostillitys and that the 
Combination is Extensive, beyond anything that has ever before Occurd,
and you must now be Sensibly—that it will be the Interrest of the
<person_mentioned>British Government</person_mentioned> to give every Encouragement to the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>to
Joine them and the powerful Influence theay have over the different
<person_mentioned>tribes</person_mentioned>, is two well known, for me to say any thing on that head—and
I have only to lament, with others the Unhappy prospect this War,<barker_pb n="214"/>
