<p>Dear Sir Your Esteemed favour of the <date_mentioned n="10-26-1824">26 of last month</date_mentioned> was
handed me <date_mentioned n="11-15-1824">yesterday</date_mentioned>—and I hasten a reply to put you at ease on
one account which appears to have given you pain and anxiety—</p>

<p>That when I mentioned the Extent of <person_mentioned>Mr. Hawkins</person_mentioned> advances for
the <location_mentioned>province </location_mentioned>I did not even for a moment suppose he had any
other claim on you than what you have mentioned to wit <hi rend="italic">One half
of the Grant</hi>—My object was to advise you of the amount and at a
proper time to have some of the property sold as a remuneration—</p>

<p>I have always supposed that <person_mentioned>Mrs. Hawkins</person_mentioned> would decline your
invitation of Settling in the <location_mentioned>Province</location_mentioned>, and lately am informed that<barker_pb n="942"/>
her <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>Sisters </person_mentioned>wont listen to any thing of the kind—They
are determined to keep her in <location_mentioned>Kentucky</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>On the subject of a division of the Grant, she has instructed me
to say that she cannot find any person to act as <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>in whom she
has the same confidence as yourself, and that she leaves the division
entirely to you—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Nath: Cox.</person_mentioned></p>
