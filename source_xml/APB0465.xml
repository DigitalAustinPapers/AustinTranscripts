<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Thinking that it might afford you some satisfaction to hear from
this <location_mentioned>Territory </location_mentioned>I have taken the opportunity of sending you a few
of my papers, by a gentleman from <location_mentioned>Cape Girardeau</location_mentioned>, who is on his
way to your <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>. I have no news to communicate except such
as you may meet with in the <location_mentioned>Gazette</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>This place is beginning to assume the appearance of a town, and
I am in hopes in a few years that it will be considered of some 
considerable importance.</p>

<p>Since my residence at this place (4 or 5 weeks) I have observed a
great number of persons emigrating to your <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, which makes
me anxious to hear what your prospects are I should be much 
gratified to hear from you, when at leasure—A description of the 
country; its rivers; produce etc, or other information respecting that
part of the <location_mentioned>Province </location_mentioned>settled by you, would be very acceptable—and,
perhaps, by inserting the same in my paper might be of service to
you. Anything that I can do to promote your interest will be done
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Wishing you success in your [undertaking and ?] prosperity to
enjoy the fruits of your labor.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm E Woodruff</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:]    <person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin Esqr. </person_mentioned>  <location_mentioned>Province of Texas</location_mentioned></p>
