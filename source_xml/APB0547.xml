<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Judge</person_mentioned></p>

<p>on the opposite side you will find the prices of the difft. articles
which you desired me to let you know - Most anxiously do I await
the arrival of letters from you which will I trust contain documents
relative to the estate in which case if the market remains as it is at
present I will immediately sell (which I can at a very good price)
some thousand acres of the land and we will carry on the business
without any <person_mentioned>partner </person_mentioned>unless indeed I can get some house here to do
our business on condition of receiving a <hi rend="italic">very small</hi> share - 
Unfortunately these d—d piracies have rendered <person_mentioned>Merchants </person_mentioned>very much
afraid of the <location_mentioned>Gulf of Mexico</location_mentioned> and the <person_mentioned>house </person_mentioned>on which I had calcu-<barker_pb n="556"/>
lated has retired from business so that I find it so very difficult to
procure cash on terms such as will suit us or rather so very different
from what can be done whenever I can produce documents provino
that the land is ceded to us by the Govt. that although I shall not
neglect to make every effort I shall accept no terms but such as I
am not likely to get at present when unable to furnish a proof or
even to state that when I quitted <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>the <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>was confirmed -
My falling into the hands of the <person_mentioned>Pirates </person_mentioned>and long detention has
played the Devil with my schemes in some respects in others I am
getting on very well - I wrote you several times and via <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>-
<location_mentioned>Havana </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>Charleston S Carolina</location_mentioned> and lately
via <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>- Do not forget to send immly [immediately] a copy of
the <location_mentioned>Map of Texas</location_mentioned> since the <person_mentioned>Pirates </person_mentioned>took mine also of the <location_mentioned>Estate </location_mentioned>and
mark of[f] most distinctly on it the lands which I can sell describe
them fully and send the <hi rend="italic">original or a fully authenticated Copy of the
<location_mentioned>Grant</location_mentioned></hi> of course of the very [first] cash I can procure I shall send
you all the article mentioned in the list if however I can get the
price up shall I [not sell?] as much [as I can? (torn)] a tolerable
price for some has lately been sold at . . . [torn] Shillings pr acre
if enabled to procure by sale of land more money than we want to
work the <location_mentioned>Estate </location_mentioned>and the most required would be I suppose 200,000
Dollars if so fortunate as I possibly may be what shall I do with
your share of any surplus . . . [illegible] it in your name in the Bnk
funds and send you the Documents or place the whole in our joint
names - With regard to the <location_mentioned>Mines </location_mentioned>I am happy to say I have already
forwarded proposals to the <person_mentioned>Mexn Govt</person_mentioned> such as it will doubtless unless
mad adopt when I shall be enabled to furnish them with whatever
cash they require - I have also in consequence of offers made me
by <person_mentioned>Merchants </person_mentioned>here proposed the terms on which I will furnish the
<person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>with a loan of 20 Millions of Dollars - We must have a little
patience and I doubt not all our affairs will go on well - I am very
sorry not to be enabled immediately to send you out all you want
unfortunately the want of documents has played the Devil with us
for the present remove that obstacle and as I am assured our <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>
will prove as fine a speculation as you had ever anticipated 
Although only a fortnight here I have already done a great deal of
business and will not [q]uit until I get through all I have to do 
believe me dear Judge</p>

<p>Your ever Most faithful friend                       <person_mentioned>A. G. Wavell</person_mentioned></p>

here staying with him -</p>
