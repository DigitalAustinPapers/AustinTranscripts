<p><person_mentioned>Wm. H. Wharton Esq</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have noticed in the <location_mentioned>newspapers </location_mentioned>your appointment as <person_mentioned>Commissioner from
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for the purpose of negociating loans and making
other arrangements for the advancement of the <person_mentioned>Texan </person_mentioned>cause. I saw a 
<person_mentioned>gentleman</person_mentioned>, a few days since, who informed me that he came with you to <location_mentioned>New
Orleans</location_mentioned> and that you would in a few days probably be in <location_mentioned>Nashville</location_mentioned>. I
have therefore embraced the opportunity of addressing you a line for the
purpose of making some enquiries and of making a conditional proposal
for raising a <person_mentioned>corps for the service of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. A <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>of mine is now an
<person_mentioned>officer </person_mentioned>of some experience in the service of the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned> and if he could be
assured of a proper reception in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>would, I have no doubt, resign, raise
a respectable <person_mentioned>corps </person_mentioned>and devote himself to the service of the rising <location_mentioned>state</location_mentioned>.
He is well qualified as an <person_mentioned>engineer </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>tactician</person_mentioned>, having graduated among
the distinguished at <location_mentioned>West Point Academy</location_mentioned> and having served five or six<barker_pb n="308"/>
years in different <person_mentioned>corps</person_mentioned>; latterly in the <person_mentioned>Dragoons</person_mentioned>. His plan is to raise a
<person_mentioned>regiment </person_mentioned>if possible of <person_mentioned>mounted riflemen</person_mentioned> and offer them to the service of
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. The place of rendezvous proposed is <location_mentioned>Jackson </location_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned>Western 
District</location_mentioned>. He is at present at <location_mentioned>Fort Des Moines</location_mentioned>, but will be in <location_mentioned>Baltimore </location_mentioned>and
<location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1836">early in March</date_mentioned>. Would such a <person_mentioned>corps </person_mentioned>be accepted? For
what time must they be engaged? How long in your opinion will the war
continue? Will <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>pay the expenses of the <person_mentioned>corps </person_mentioned>from the time they
are embodied and will some advance be made for procuring the necessary
equipments</p>

<p>I am informed that you will probably be at <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned> in <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1836">March</date_mentioned>.
If so, I and my <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>will meet you there at that time and enter into some
definite arrangements if the proposal is accepted. In the mean time you
will oblige me with a speedy answer.— Some <person_mentioned>persons </person_mentioned>are of the opinion
that the war will be speedily ended. I am not of that opinion but cannot
now enter into my reasons for coming to a different conclusion; but will
give them when I have a more convenient opportunity—With great respect</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm. W. Lea.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I write in haste and you will excuse errors</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Wm H Wharton Esq</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Nashville Tennessee</location_mentioned></p>
<p>[Postmark:] <location_mentioned>Eaton T</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="01-19-1836">Jany 19th</date_mentioned> Free <person_mentioned>Wm. W. Lea</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>P. M</person_mentioned>.</p>
