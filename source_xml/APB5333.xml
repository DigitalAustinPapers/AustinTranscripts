<p>Colombia Texas Decr. 10. 1836</p>

<p>Messrs <person_mentioned>Parish Gasquet & Co</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned></p>

<p>Gentlemen</p>

<p>On the <date_mentioned n="11-25-1836">25th Ult</date_mentioned> I made a contract with <person_mentioned>Col Bernard E Bee of <location_mentioned>South
Carolina</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for the sale of Land, and he gave me drafts on your <location_mentioned>house </location_mentioned>for<barker_pb n="475"/>
One thousand eight hundred dollars payable <date_mentioned n="01-01-1837">first of January next</date_mentioned>—seven
thousand dollars payable <date_mentioned n="03-01-1836">first of March next</date_mentioned> and two thousand four 
hundred and fifty dollars payable <date_mentioned n="05-01-1836">first of may next</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>In the hurry of closing this business on the departure of <person_mentioned>Col Bee</person_mentioned>, he
omitted through mistake to sign the first mentioned drafts, that is for
($1800) one thousand eight hundred dollars payable <date_mentioned n="01-01-1836">first of January—</date_mentioned>
He handed me the drafts and contract and we both believed they were
all signed and did not discover the mistake untill after he was gone— He
informed me that he would instruct you to pay them, so that I have no
doubt it will be done. I have therefore drawn on you for said sum of
($1800) one thousand eight hundred dollars, favor of <person_mentioned>John A. Merle and
Co.</person_mentioned> which you will please pay and charge the same to <person_mentioned>Col Bee.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I have inclosed the unsigned draft to Messrs <person_mentioned>John A Merle and Co.</person_mentioned> with
an endorsement and am bound in property and honor to <person_mentioned>Col Bee</person_mentioned> if the
transaction is not as I have stated in this letter—</p>

<p>By the terms of the contract the sale of land is void if the money is not
paid on the days specified.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S F Austin</person_mentioned></p>
