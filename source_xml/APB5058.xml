<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I arrived in <location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>on the <date_mentioned n="11-13-1835">13th Inst</date_mentioned> and found that the heavy piece of
Cannon had been put <location_mentioned>on board the San Felipe</location_mentioned> which had gone in pursuit
of a Mexican Armed Vessel and was lost inside the <location_mentioned>Matagorda Bay</location_mentioned> the
guns was however saved and landed on <location_mentioned>bird Island</location_mentioned> on getting this 
information I despatched <person_mentioned>Mr Tanner</person_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>with letters to the <person_mentioned>Committee</person_mentioned>
of that place requesting any assistance that might be necessary in [order to]<barker_pb n="265"/>
get it to the <location_mentioned>main land</location_mentioned> and to forward it on to the <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned>with all speed, 
intending to follow on myself so soon as I could provide some means by
which a <person_mentioned>Company of Volunteers from <location_mentioned>New-Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> could be enabled to join
the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>they had arrived some days previous and was very much 
disatisfied at the delay. I left on the <date_mentioned n="11-18-1835">18th</date_mentioned> calculated on joining the cannon at 
<location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>on the road</location_mentioned> on My way I met <person_mentioned>Mr Patton</person_mentioned> directly from 
<location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>who told me that the Schooner William Robbins had sailed on the
<date_mentioned n="11-13-1835">13th Inst</date_mentioned>—from that place with the Intention of taking the Cannon <location_mentioned>on board</location_mentioned>
and bringing it round to the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>I have therefore delayed and have sent
<person_mentioned>expresses </person_mentioned>to both places—and so soon as I can learn at what point the
cannon can be found I will use every exertion to get her to <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>—the
weather has been excessively bad and the <location_mentioned>roads </location_mentioned>are very muddy however
nothing shall be wanting to expedite matters— I wrote you on the <date_mentioned n="11-18-1835">18th
inst</date_mentioned> tendering my resignation at the same time I shall be proud and
ready to execute any orders in my power and to give any pecuniary aid that
my means will justify</p>
