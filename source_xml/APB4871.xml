<p><location_mentioned>Committee Room, San Felipe</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="09-13-1835">Sept. 13th 1835</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The undersigned, a <person_mentioned>Committee of correspondence and vigilance</person_mentioned>, 
appointed by a very large and general Meeting of the <person_mentioned>citizens of the 
<location_mentioned>Jurisdiction of Austin</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, convened at this place on the <date_mentioned n="09-12-1835">12th ins.</date_mentioned>, have the honor to
transmit to you, in pursuance of the duties assigned them, a copy of the
resolutions adopted by said meeting, in order that you will lay before the
<person_mentioned>people of that <location_mentioned>section of the country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and solicit their co-operation.</p>

<p>This <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>deem it to be entirely unnecessary, to enter into a long
statement of facts, to shew why a general consultation of all <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is 
indispensible, for the reason that the present crisis is so evident and alarming,,
that no one appears to doubt it.</p>

<p>This necessity seems to be so evident and pressing, that a <person_mentioned>general 
consultation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, with full and unlimited power, to organize a local 
Government, under the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>, has been advocated by many instead
of a consultation. But is is considered that this is a step that cannot be
safely adopted with any certainty of unanimity, by any <location_mentioned>district </location_mentioned>or 
<location_mentioned>Municipality</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Such a measure and the necessary rules and regulations for directing
elections and apportioning the representation equally, according to the
population, the place where, and the time when the <person_mentioned>Convention </person_mentioned>ought to
meet, and other important details can only be determined by all <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
met in general Consultation. The measures which may be adopted by such
<person_mentioned>General Consultation</person_mentioned> will carry with them the weight of being the <hi rend="italic">voice</hi>
of all <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>instead of the <hi rend="italic">opinion </hi>of a few. They will be the result of
calm discussion and of a full and mature deliberation and examination
into the true situation of the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, and cannot fail to produce unanimity
at home, respect and confidence <location_mentioned>abroad</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>This <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>deem it to be important that the just and legal rights of
the <person_mentioned>civilized Indians</person_mentioned> should be protected, but not having any certain 
information on this subject, they can only recommend it to your consideration.</p>

<p>Some diversity of opinion has existed, as to the place where the 
proposed consultation should meet. <location_mentioned>This place</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>have been
proposed. The meeting of <date_mentioned n="09-11-1835">yesterday</date_mentioned>, have preferred this place for the 
reasons that there is a printing press here. The most important public records
are here, and the <person_mentioned>principal political authority of this <location_mentioned>department</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> resides
here. This question will of course be decided by the wishes of the 
<person_mentioned>majority</person_mentioned>, for which reason, it is important that you will communicate to this,
committee, what are the wishes of the <person_mentioned>people of that <location_mentioned>section</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, on this point.</p><barker_pb n="124"/>

<p>This <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>must beg of you to communicate without delay, with the
<person_mentioned>People on <location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, in <location_mentioned>Pecan Point country</location_mentioned>, and request them to send
<person_mentioned>members </person_mentioned>to the proposed <person_mentioned>General Consultation</person_mentioned>. They are <person_mentioned>Texans</person_mentioned>, and their
interests and rights are identified with those of all <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>This <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>in conclusion, recommend that the <person_mentioned>delegation from <location_mentioned>each
district</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, bring with them an exact census of the population, and return of
the <person_mentioned>Militia from their <location_mentioned>districts</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, to lay before the <person_mentioned>General Consultation</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Very Respectfully,</p>

<p>Your Fellow <person_mentioned>Citizens</person_mentioned>.</p>
