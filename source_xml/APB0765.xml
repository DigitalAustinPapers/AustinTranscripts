<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>agreeable to the notice we received some of us agreed to have a
meeting but I think we lack publick spirit. I would come up but
our horses have been injurd by the flies so much that I could not
come. My wish is that this country should populate fast and I
think that nothing would facilitate that more than the admission
of Slavery in this state. An act for the regestering of marks and
brands also ought to claim the attention of the <person_mentioned>Legislature </person_mentioned>The
increase of stock will cause difficulties. An act to prevent the 
killing of Deer and Wild horses for the Skins alone I think necessary
also. An [act] to prevent persons from Setting the <location_mentioned>praria</location_mentioned> on fire
near the <location_mentioned>Settlements </location_mentioned>would be necessary; at certain seasons if the
<location_mentioned>praria </location_mentioned>was fird it would destroy our stocks. As a citizen wishing
to conform to every request of my <person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>I have thought proper to
communicate my sentiments in this way</p>
