<p>The <person_mentioned>committee of Safety for the <location_mentioned>Jurisdiction of Austin</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, in conjunction
with <person_mentioned>other committees in <location_mentioned>different parts of the country</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, say to their <person_mentioned>fellow-citizens</person_mentioned> : that</p>

<p>The time has now arrived when it behooves every <person_mentioned>friend </person_mentioned>to his <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>
to be up and doing. Intelligence of the most interesting and important
character has just reached this <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>from the <location_mentioned>camp of our 
<person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned></location_mentioned>.<person_mentioned> Colonel Ugartechea</person_mentioned> is on his march from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>500 men</person_mentioned>, to<barker_pb n="166"/>
overrun our <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. They come to fasten down upon our necks the yoke,
and to rivet upon our hands the manacles of military servitude. <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>
is doomed to the sword and the flame. <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>will next be the <location_mentioned>theatre of
blood and rapine</location_mentioned>—then the <location_mentioned>Brazos</location_mentioned>—till every spot of our rich and fertile
country shall present to the eye but one wide scene of devastation, and we,
the <person_mentioned>rightful proprietors</person_mentioned>, be driven from the soil which we have reclaimed
by our toils and sufferings from a savage <location_mentioned>wilderness</location_mentioned>, and which we have
made valuable by our labor and hardy enterprise. Shall we give up 
without a struggle, the fruits of so many years of danger, difficulty and 
unparalleled suffering? Shall we surrender our <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and our <location_mentioned>homes </location_mentioned>to
a military usurpation? Are we willing to forego all the advantages held
out to us as the recompense of the most daring enterprise? Can we let a
<person_mentioned>military despot</person_mentioned> reap the harvest after we have sown the seeds? This 
<person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>are ready to answer for their <person_mentioned>countrymen</person_mentioned>; and they answer by 
calling upon them to come, and come quickly, to the assistance of their <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>,
their <person_mentioned>neighbours</person_mentioned>, and their <person_mentioned>brothers</person_mentioned>, three hundred of whom are already
<location_mentioned>on the field</location_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>colonel Austin</person_mentioned> is with them. These have to contend with the
whole of the <person_mentioned>Mexican army</person_mentioned>; but they will contend bravely; they will
dispute every inch of ground with their <person_mentioned>invaders </person_mentioned>untill the expected aid
shall arrive.</p>
