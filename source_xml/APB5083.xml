<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty to place your note, which calls for five hundred
and Twelve Dollars and fifty cents in the hands of <person_mentioned>Mr Marcus L. Fulton</person_mentioned>
for collection, which I hope you will honor any arrangement that you and
<person_mentioned>Mr Fulton</person_mentioned> may make, will be considered binding by me— You will also
call to memory that my Brother <person_mentioned>Edward</person_mentioned>, loaned you One hundred Dollars
in <location_mentioned>Natchez</location_mentioned> prior to your going to <location_mentioned>new Orleans</location_mentioned> and which was not included
in the five hundred Dollar note—and after you left <location_mentioned>new Orleans</location_mentioned> and 
before the Vessel sailed from <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>—he laid out one hundred Dollars for
provisions for the use of said <person_mentioned>crew</person_mentioned>, this hundred Dollars I presume you
never heard of before, as you and my <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>never saw each other after
the transaction. Nevertheless it is as correct as the balance, but that will
rest with you to say whether you will recognize it as such. I presume you
will not hesitate to pay interest on the amount—as you are satisfied that
you never could have sent that vessel to the <location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned>without his assistance.
You have heard of the death of my <person_mentioned>Brothers </person_mentioned>I am the only one living I
hope you will succeed in your struggle for freedom, and soon be able to
organise your <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>—</p>
