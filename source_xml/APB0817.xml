<p>Dear Sir Since last writing you I have prepared a Power of
Attorney to enable the Judge to do something in that <person_mentioned>Modeira </person_mentioned>
business I fear that <person_mentioned>Dimmit </person_mentioned>has [not?] done what I instructed him
<person_mentioned>Mosquis </person_mentioned>and his friend <person_mentioned>Donvictor </person_mentioned>both promised to aid him in the
collection of debt In fact they are honourably bound to pay the
money it was [with] them my <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>Contracted for the freight
of those articles and Not <person_mentioned>Modeira </person_mentioned>and fact <person_mentioned>Don Victor Blanco</person_mentioned> 
offered to pay the Money before they left <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned> and in a letter
from <location_mentioned>Mont Clover [Monclova]</location_mentioned> offered his services again to Collect
that Money I have No hesitation in believing that <person_mentioned>Mosquis </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>Donvictor </person_mentioned>will not suffer me to loose that Money it was hardly
earned I paid out of my Own pocket at least $150 to vessels and
hands to endevor to get their Articles landed at the <location_mentioned>Guadaloop</location_mentioned>
Instead of the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>where My <location_mentioned>Brother </location_mentioned>agreed to land them,
that was done to save Carriage from the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>
this they know to be true under those Circumstances they ought
to feel themselves bound to pay that debt please get <person_mentioned>Judge Austin</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Allouri </person_mentioned>to sell the property also to Collect this Money <person_mentioned>Don
Manuel Allouri</person_mentioned> knows me to be a correct Man I must feel 
satisfied that when I left <location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> that I had Made more than ample
arrangement to have [illegible] debt paid I left in the hands of
Dimmit at least $1100 of claims On what the best men in Country
the Go. among the rest say if <person_mentioned>Sandovall </person_mentioned>paid <person_mentioned>Dimmit </person_mentioned>the money<barker_pb n="871"/>
I loaned him and what has become of him, If his own Country Men
after the services rendered them will de[a]l so dishonest it is a 
misfortune I had rather beg my bread than live among men that you
cannot make a transaction with without being deceived by them I
can say with truth that the only honest men in the Two Citties are
<person_mentioned>Don Erasmo</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Don Allouri</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Don Victor Blanco</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Don E. Mosquis
</person_mentioned>. . . [torn] did the <person_mentioned>Don Doctor hewitson</person_mentioned> ever pay <person_mentioned>Dimmit </person_mentioned>for the
gold Watch which I let him have I should like to know what has
become of the <person_mentioned>Doctor </person_mentioned>if married to some lady that any man can have
access to who has a little cash I fear that is his fate before this period
at <location_mentioned>Mon Clover</location_mentioned> I have so many things to say that I am at a loss
what to say first please speek of me to our <person_mentioned>friends in <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>
