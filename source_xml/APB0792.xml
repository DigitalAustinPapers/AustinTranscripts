<p>[June —, 1824.]</p>
<p>I call you brothers because the <person_mentioned>chiefs of your <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who came to
the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>about 3 Moons ago told the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>who live there
that the <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tawakanes </person_mentioned>were <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and wished to be at
peace with them—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>have always been <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and met and
parted like <person_mentioned>brothers </person_mentioned>and so they ought always to be—and so the
<person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>always wish to be—but some bad men of the <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>or
some of their <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>last year spilt blood in the path which had 
before then been always clean, <person_mentioned>J. T.</person_mentioned> one of our people was murdered on
the <location_mentioned>Guadalupe </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>who said they were <person_mentioned>Wecos</person_mentioned>—he was much
beloved by the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and they all cried out for revenge—and I
intended to have made a campain against your towns to revenge the
murder for the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>will never suffer any of their people to be
killed or robbed without punishing the <person_mentioned>murderers </person_mentioned>or the robbers but
I heard of the words of your <person_mentioned>chiefs </person_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>, that they wished<barker_pb n="845"/>
to be at peace with the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and would punish the <person_mentioned>murderers</person_mentioned>
of <person_mentioned>Tumlinson</person_mentioned>—I informed the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>of these words and they
all said that the <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>had always been their <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and that they
did not wish for war with them, but that the <person_mentioned>murderers </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Tumlinson</person_mentioned>
must be punished and then they would be satisfied. I have therefore
sent up some young men to talk with you and to deliver you these
words from the <person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>will be at peace with the <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tawakanes</person_mentioned>
and trade with them as <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>brothers </person_mentioned>provided the <person_mentioned>chiefs </person_mentioned>of
that <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>will agree to punish the <person_mentioned>murderers </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Tumlinson</person_mentioned>. The
path between us shall then be clean and both <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>can travel in
safety. The <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tawakanes </person_mentioned>must not disturb the <person_mentioned>settlers on
the <location_mentioned>Brazos </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and if any of those <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>misuse any of your
nation I will punish them for it if the chief will inform me and if
any of your nation steal from or misuse any of the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>the
<person_mentioned>chief </person_mentioned>must deliver them to the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>to be killed or whipped
according to the crime they have committed—in this way we may
keep a peace between us as long as the sun shall shine, All bad men
will then be punished and all the good ones can live in their <location_mentioned>houses</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>villages </location_mentioned>with their <person_mentioned>women </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>and plant their corn in
peace and safety. My <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>are a great people they
are like the leaves on the trees—they are all good <person_mentioned>warriors</person_mentioned>—and well
armed—they are true <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and dangerous <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>they never
beg peace of any nation, they are always ready for war or peace,
but they prefer peace for they wish to be <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>brothers</person_mentioned>
with all the <person_mentioned>Indians of this <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, the <person_mentioned>Wecos </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tawakanes </person_mentioned>can
therefore chose and send me word by the young men what they 
intend, and whether they are willing to punish the <person_mentioned>murders </person_mentioned>of 
<person_mentioned>Tumlinson </person_mentioned>and be at peace with the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>or whether they wish for
war—</p>

<p>[Endorsed:] Talk sent to the <person_mentioned>Weco Indians</person_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Duke </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Selkirk</person_mentioned></p>
