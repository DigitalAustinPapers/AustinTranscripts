<p><person_mentioned>Genl. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr. Sr</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="10-13-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>I communicated to you as the <person_mentioned>commander of the detachment
at this place</person_mentioned> now I write as a <person_mentioned>private soldier</person_mentioned> from the time your order
came here to mantain the <location_mentioned>post </location_mentioned>at the risk of all hazzards—Their was shown
a disposition among the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>to disobey the order—This <date_mentioned n="10-14-1835">morning </date_mentioned>an open
determination was shown to leave the place in consequence of which I 
resigned my command as did <person_mentioned>officers of the Columbia Company</person_mentioned>—I could
not do less your orders I am determined to obey even as a <person_mentioned>private</person_mentioned></p><barker_pb n="183"/>

<p>The <person_mentioned>whole of the men</person_mentioned> have the greatest inclination to leave <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned>
many have upon more reflection promised still to stay untill you can be
heard from</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Company </person_mentioned>has been reorganized and the <person_mentioned>same officers</person_mentioned> reappointed—
some of the discontented will go on to you and I hope under the 
circumstances (the situation of the country) this departure from millitary duty
may [be] looked over</p>

<p>When I wrote <date_mentioned n="10-13-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>it was my desire to have urged you to order on
immediately because I know <person_mentioned>Millitia </person_mentioned>could not be kept at <location_mentioned>a post like this
</location_mentioned>long at a time—and in this I was correct—take warning by this mishap
you are not upon a bed of roses—and if you are compeled to stay long at
a place; rely upon it, your <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>will desert you—There is nothing but their
honor to govern them—that is in many cases but a <hi rend="italic">cobweb</hi>— I know too
much of my duty to leave <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned> untill I here from you—I have 
prevaild upon <person_mentioned>many of the company</person_mentioned> to do so but I have but little confidence
that they can be quiet long without moving somewhare or other—What 
influence I may have shall be used to support you in your authority in all
that is just and proper—In this opinion I may be obtrusive but as one who
has much at stake I have a right to make such suggestions as may not be
offensive—Let me urge you to keep your men in motion—be careful in
your operations for I am persuaded you will have to contend for <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>if
you get it— It is a last hope with <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>and if you should be defeated <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
must suffer—and the <location_mentioned>frontier </location_mentioned>must <hi rend="italic">bleede </hi>freely for it—Let us be united
in our forces and make a bold push and all will be right—but a devission
of our little <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>may be ruinous to our cause</p>
