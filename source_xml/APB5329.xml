<p><location_mentioned>Anahuac </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-07-1836">Decr. 7th' 1836</date_mentioned>.—</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>By <person_mentioned>Mr. Richardson</person_mentioned> I have sent over a few oranges, which were gathered
from my grove near <location_mentioned>N. Washington</location_mentioned>, a few days since; one of which you
will please accept, as I think you requested me to send it.— I should have
sent more, but it was inconvenient to carry them in saddle bags you know,
where a <person_mentioned>traveller </person_mentioned>has so much other luggage to carry in so small a space.—
I have directed <person_mentioned>Mr. R</person_mentioned> to hand one to <person_mentioned>Mrs. McKinstry</person_mentioned> likewise, which she
will please accept, not as a rarity or curiosity, but because it is the 
production of <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></hi>.— I shall endeavor to send a few to <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> to satisfy the
people there that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>can produce the fruits of the <location_mentioned>tropics </location_mentioned>as well as
cotton and grain.—</p>
<p><person_mentioned>J Morgan</person_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>Genl. S. F. Austin.</person_mentioned></p>
