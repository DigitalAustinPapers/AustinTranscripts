<p><location_mentioned>Quintana</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="12-22-1835">December 22, 1835</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs: We expect to get off <date_mentioned n="12-23-1835">to-morrow</date_mentioned> in the Wm. Robbins; <person_mentioned>Archer</person_mentioned>,
the two <person_mentioned>Whartons</person_mentioned> and myself and several other <person_mentioned>passengers</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of low intrigue in the political maneuvering
of a <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>who I am at last forced to believe have their own personal 
ambition and aggrandizement in view, more than the good of the country. These
men have operated on <person_mentioned>Archer </person_mentioned>until they have made him almost a political
<person_mentioned>fanatic</person_mentioned>, preaching a crusade in favor of liberty against the <location_mentioned>city of Mexico</location_mentioned>,
the only place short of which the <person_mentioned>army of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> ought to stop, etc.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>say that it is rather curious that the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> should
fight against <person_mentioned>military rulers</person_mentioned>, and at the same time try to build up an <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>
that may, in its turn, rule <person_mentioned>Texas </person_mentioned>as it pleases. I think it probable there
will be some thousands [of] <person_mentioned>volunteers from the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in a few
months. They nearly all wish to join the <person_mentioned>regular army</person_mentioned> on the basis of
<person_mentioned>volunteers</person_mentioned>. What shall we do with so many? How support them? I fear
that the true secret of the efforts to declare independence is, that there must
then be a considerable <person_mentioned>standing army</person_mentioned>, which, in the hands of a few, would
dispose of the <person_mentioned>old settlers</person_mentioned> and their interests as they thought proper.</p>

<p>The true policy for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>is to call a convention, amend the declaration
of the <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7th of November last</date_mentioned>, by declaring <location_mentioned>Texas a State of the Mexican
Confederacy</location_mentioned> under the basis laid down in the fifth and other articles of
said declaration of the <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7th of November</date_mentioned>, form a constitution and organize
a <person_mentioned>permanent government</person_mentioned>. Every possible aid should be given to the 
<person_mentioned>Federal party</person_mentioned> in the <location_mentioned>interior</location_mentioned>; but it should be done as <person_mentioned>auxiliary </person_mentioned>aid, in 
conformity with the second article of the declaration. By doing this the war
will be kept out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. This <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>will remain at peace. It will fill
up rapidly with <location_mentioned>families</location_mentioned>, and there will be no great need of a <person_mentioned>standing
army</person_mentioned>. I believe that the combinations in the <person_mentioned>state of Tamaulipas</person_mentioned> are very
extensive to form a new republic by <location_mentioned>a line from Tampico, west to the
Pacific</location_mentioned>, and it is probable that the capitulation at <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>was made to 
promote that object. In short, it is much easier to keep the war out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,
than to bring it back again to our own doors. All that is necessary is for
us <hi rend="italic">not to do any king that will compel the <person_mentioned>Federal party</person_mentioned> to turn against us,
</hi>and if they call on us for aid let it be given as <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>auxiliary </person_mentioned>aid</hi>, and on no
other footing.</p><barker_pb n="290"/>

<p>This takes away the character of a national war, which the <person_mentioned>government
in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> is trying to give it, and it will also give to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>just claims on
the <person_mentioned>Federal party</person_mentioned>, for remuneration out of the proceeds of the <location_mentioned>custom
houses of Matamoros and Tampico</location_mentioned>, for our expenses in furnishing the
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>auxiliary </person_mentioned>aid.</hi> But if <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>sends an <hi rend="italic">invading </hi><person_mentioned>force of foreign troops</person_mentioned>
against <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>, it will change the whole matter. <person_mentioned>Gen. Mexia</person_mentioned> ought to
have commanded the <person_mentioned>expedition to <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and only waited to be asked
by the <person_mentioned>Provisional Government</person_mentioned> to do so.</p>

<p>I repeat: It is much easier to keep the war out of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>beyond the
Rio Grande</location_mentioned>, thah to bring it here to our own doors. The <person_mentioned>farmers </person_mentioned>and 
<person_mentioned>substantial men of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">can yet save themselves</hi>, but to do so they must act
in union and as one man.</p>

<p>This, I fear, is impossible. In the <location_mentioned>upper settlement</location_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Dr. Hoxey</person_mentioned> is loud
for independence. Of Course he is in favor of a large <person_mentioned>standing army</person_mentioned> to
sustain it, and will no doubt be ready to give up half, or all, of his 
property to support thousands of <person_mentioned>volunteers</person_mentioned>, etc., who will flood the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>
from <location_mentioned>abroad</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>It is all very well and right to show to the world that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has just and
equitable grounds to declare independence; but it is putting the <person_mentioned>old settlers</person_mentioned>
in great danger to make any such declaration, for it will turn all the
<person_mentioned>parties in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> against us. <hi rend="italic">It will</hi> bring back the war to our doors,
which is now far from us, and <hi rend="italic">it will</hi> compel the <person_mentioned>men of property in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>to give up half or all to support a <person_mentioned>standing army</person_mentioned> of sufficient magnitude to
contend with all <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>united.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>.</p>
