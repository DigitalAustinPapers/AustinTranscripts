<p><location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="06-27-1821">June 27, 1821</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>

<p>Your son <person_mentioned>Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned> has been a member of my family for
the last eight months—His amiable qualities of the heart combined
with his intelligence and acquirements will always secure him
friends—</p>

<p>And our intercourse has resulted in mutually warm and I trust
lasting attachment. He had set his heart on facilitating the views of
his <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>in his contemplated settlement in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—And believing
the enterprise laudable, and perhaps promising some reward to those
who would toil in its prosecution, I agreed to meet the proposition<barker_pb n="398"/>
of his <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>, and take a joint interest in the grant and settlement—
Upon receiving your last letter enclosing one from your <person_mentioned>son</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr.
Bryan</person_mentioned> enjoining so strongly on <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>in the name of his <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>
the fulfilment of his objects (which indisposition then prevented his
doing,) <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>and myself both concluded it was best for him to set
out immediately and meet the <person_mentioned>Spanish officers</person_mentioned> waiting at <location_mentioned>Nachitoches</location_mentioned>
to conduct him to the <location_mentioned>grant</location_mentioned>—and take a number of respectable 
persons along with him to explore the Country—He set out from this
place ten days ago to effect this object taking some 8 or 10 persons
with him—The <person_mentioned>Spanish Officers</person_mentioned> having been waiting some time they
have probably by this time set out for the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I have advanced <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>all the funds he desired for the 
expedition and have promised to furnish more as he requires them—His
prospects seem flattering so far as the good feelings of the local 
<person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>can promise success.</p>

<p>I had expected his <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>here as soon as his health would permit,
and was prepared to further his views by every friendly effort in my
power—Today I learn that that <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>—is no more—I have no 
consolation my dear madam for this afflictive dispensation— Your only
consolation is to be found in the resignation which we owe to the
will of Heaven— Blessed by the dear pledges of affection left behind,
you should for their sake meet this inroad upon your happiness with
the fortitude necessary to sustain it—¦</p>

<p>God still tempers the wind to the shorn lamb-—- It is the Cup of
afflication that chastens and brightens the pearls scattered before us
here, and sometimes prepares us for that hereafter, where " the
weary are at rest, and the wicked cease from troubling "—</p>

<p>Pardon the liberty I take in addressing you— My only object is
to fil the place of your <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>until he shall return to you— Pray
look upon me as such— Will you allow me to ask if any remittance
of money or shipment of articles from this place is now necessary to
your comforts? I promised <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>to write you if anything 
happened and would to God I could alleviate your sorrows—</p>
<p>Yrs truly and respty</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jos: H Hawkins</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. I shall forward an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>informing him of his
fatal loss—but shall urge him by all means to prosecute the objects
of his Enterprise.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>J. H. H</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:]<person_mentioned> Mrs Austin Widow of the late M. Austin Esq</person_mentioned> Near
<location_mentioned>Herculaneum State Missouri</location_mentioned>.</p>
