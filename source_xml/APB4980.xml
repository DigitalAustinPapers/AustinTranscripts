<p><location_mentioned>Mission of Espada</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-23-1835">23d octr 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>5 Oclk P M friday evening</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Genl Austin</person_mentioned>—In conformity with your orders, and agreeably to our
suggestions of<date_mentioned n="10-22-1835"> last night</date_mentioned>, we marched to the <location_mentioned>Missions above this</location_mentioned>, and make
the following report of their situation and such oher information as we
deem important—at the <location_mentioned>Mission of St Juan</location_mentioned>, they only planted three pecks
of corn, and it is <hi rend="italic">yet <location_mentioned>in the field</location_mentioned></hi>, and very fine—The <person_mentioned>Citizens </person_mentioned>are well 
disposed, and now look to us for protection—and should the <person_mentioned>Enimy </person_mentioned>attempt
to withdraw their corn, information will be forthwith recd- from them</p>

<p>At the <location_mentioned>Mission of St Jose</location_mentioned>, we find <hi rend="italic">no corn</hi>, the <location_mentioned>dam </location_mentioned>having been broke
early this season and the crop abandoned—only a small crop of Peas, and
these not yet well ripened—This <location_mentioned>Mission </location_mentioned>is in a dilapidated state and only
<person_mentioned>one family</person_mentioned> at it—At the former, several respectable <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, and the walls
in a good state of preservation, and a strong hold for defence—</p>

<p><location_mentioned>St Jose</location_mentioned> has fine <location_mentioned>quarters </location_mentioned>for the <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>, but the <hi rend="italic">water too remote</hi>, and too
much at the mercy of the <person_mentioned>enimy</person_mentioned>— No intelligence from the <person_mentioned>Segienes</person_mentioned>, as
yet—We learn that <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>to the amt of <person_mentioned>30 men</person_mentioned> arrived—in <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>
<date_mentioned n="10-22-1835">last night</date_mentioned>—also that you had a slight skirmish with an <location_mentioned>outpost </location_mentioned>in which
they report only one killed—he being shot in the eye—</p>

<p>They say two more <person_mentioned>parties of reinforcements</person_mentioned> are looked for daily—If we
had fifty men more, we could keep out <person_mentioned>spyes </person_mentioned><location_mentioned>on the two road</location_mentioned>s and cut
them off, and be in no sort of danger ourselves</p>

<p>There is but little money in <location_mentioned>Camp</location_mentioned>—and the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>are complaining that
corn and other provisions are not furnished them—</p>

<p>We will make purchases of Beef and corn <date_mentioned n="10-23-1835">tonight </date_mentioned>with our own funds
and hope to hear from you <date_mentioned n="10-24-1835">tomorrow </date_mentioned>early—Our private resources are
quite limited, and cannot be expected to last beyond <date_mentioned n="10-24-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>—or we
should not apply to you for aid—You know the materials we have—they
will fight—and fight desperately; but must <hi rend="italic">Eat</hi>.
We expect to take a position in the timber, <location_mentioned>near Bexar</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-24-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>; and
request regular information from you, that we may be fully apprized of
your movements, and know how far ours comport with your views; and
will insure success to our cause.—The <person_mentioned>Courier from <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has this moment
come in, and says that the man reported shot and killed, is not dead—but
shot where we heard, and must certainly die—and the <person_mentioned>leader of the party</person_mentioned>,
slightly wounded by a Pistol ball and only <hi rend="italic">three </hi>Rifles heard crack—
They have put the <person_mentioned>commander </person_mentioned>and most of the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>in <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>prison </location_mentioned></hi>for 
cowardice—The <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>did arrive, under <person_mentioned>Baragan </person_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>30 men</person_mentioned>—and no
more spoken of—He is stationed in <location_mentioned>5th street</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Politcal Chief</person_mentioned> has fled—and every other principal man we wrote
to with him— Their <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>was 100—and yours reported only 15—</p><barker_pb n="206"/>

<p>The <person_mentioned>owner of <location_mentioned>this place</</location_mentioned>person_mentioned> is <hi rend="italic">suspected</hi>, and the <person_mentioned>courier </person_mentioned>would not approach
him for fear of detection and exposure (<person_mentioned>Jose Antonio Garza</person_mentioned> is his name)
Do let us hear from you, and receive some aid to furnish provisions for
our <person_mentioned>men</person_mentioned>—Should you send, your <person_mentioned>courier </person_mentioned>will hear from us hear</p>

<p>In haste, We subscribe ourselves</p>
