<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I wrote you this day to <location_mentioned>Nachitosh </location_mentioned>and now write again not 
knowing where to find [you]— I recd your letter from the <location_mentioned>Arkansas </location_mentioned>in
which you request me to purchase a <location_mentioned>Madrid claim</location_mentioned>— Orders have
lately come on the <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Surveyor</person_mentioned>s office</location_mentioned> here to prepare the <location_mentioned>Red River
Country</location_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Market </location_mentioned>as soon as possible and in consequence <location_mentioned>Madrid
claims</location_mentioned> have risen very much as the <person_mentioned>Speculators </person_mentioned>are purchasing them
up to locate on <location_mentioned>Red River</location_mentioned>. 12$ an acre have been offered for them
on a credit in this State of things I have determined to Sell all
your Flour here and buy a <location_mentioned>Madrid claim</location_mentioned> with the money, which I
will locate on My improvement in the <location_mentioned>Long Prairie</location_mentioned>— I advise you
to return as quick as possible with all the Money you [can] and buy
<location_mentioned>Madrid Claims</location_mentioned>- <person_mentioned>Doctor R. D. Dawson</person_mentioned> at <location_mentioned>New Madrid</location_mentioned> has some
that can be got reasonable for Cash, and if you return for this 
purpose go by there and See him</p>

<p>I hope to be off in <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1818">Feby</date_mentioned>. and am trying to raise your other Boat,
to go down in for the one you got from <person_mentioned>Butler </person_mentioned>is too unsafe to trust
anything in- I am anxious to hear what you think of the <location_mentioned>Long
Prairie</location_mentioned> In not sending the Boat I have done as if the property had
been My own-the claim if I get one shall be located for our joint
benefit- the <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>are all well- I should like to see you on <location_mentioned>Red
River</location_mentioned> but it is so uncertain when I shall be there that you ought not
to wate, but return by land as quick as you can, and Secure some land
there before it is too late</p>
