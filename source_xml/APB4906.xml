<p><location_mentioned>San Felipe</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-03-1835">Oct. 3. 1835</date_mentioned></p>

<p>I have this moment recd your letters dated <date_mentioned n="10-01-1835">1st instant</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The communications which were taken <date_mentioned n="10-02-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>Mr Lightfoot</person_mentioned>, and
today by <person_mentioned>Mr Perkins</person_mentioned>, will have informed you fully of the attack made on
<location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>, and that <person_mentioned>voluntiers </person_mentioned>from <location_mentioned>every part of this country</location_mentioned> have marched
and are marching to <location_mentioned>that point</location_mentioned>, which is at present the <location_mentioned>general rendezvous
of the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">army of the people</hi></person_mentioned></location_mentioned>— <person_mentioned>Expresses </person_mentioned>have been sent to <location_mentioned>Trinity </location_mentioned>and to
<location_mentioned>Nacogdoches</location_mentioned>, and a <person_mentioned>large force</person_mentioned> is expected from <location_mentioned>that quarter</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The campaign is opened, and it must not be closed untill <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>is taken
and all the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>are driven out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></p>.

<p>A report reached here that the <person_mentioned>voluntiers from <location_mentioned>Colombia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who were to
rendezvous at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Kerr</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> had been turned back, in consequence of news received
by them from <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>—in consequence of which I dispatched an 
<person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Colombia </location_mentioned>on receipt of the news of the attack on <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>— I also
dispatched the same to <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>, and <date_mentioned n="10-02-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>La Baca.</location_mentioned></p>

<p>Correct information, as to <person_mentioned>Cos</person_mentioned>'s movements, and concert between 
<location_mentioned>Gonzales </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>La Baca</location_mentioned> is very important— It is possible that <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>may attempt
a forced march to <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, in the absence of the<person_mentioned> men at
<location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>It would be well to keep this idea in view and to obtain certain 
information, when he left <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, and where the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Morelos </location_mentioned>Battalion</person_mentioned> have stopped—
whether they went on to <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, or have remained at <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>— I expect the<barker_pb n="153"/>
<person_mentioned>men from <location_mentioned>Harrisburg</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> will be on by <date_mentioned n="10-04-1835">to-morrow</date_mentioned> or <date_mentioned n="10-05-1835">next day </date_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned>,
and unless otherwise advised they will continue on to <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned></p>

<p>I regret that there are no Guns to be had in <location_mentioned>this quarter</location_mentioned> for the supply of
<person_mentioned>Capt. Aliens company</person_mentioned>. There is public powder at <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>which you
can get by applying for in my name to the <person_mentioned>committee of that place</person_mentioned>, as they
informed me they would hold it subject to my order.</p>

<p>I shall dispatch <person_mentioned>expresses </person_mentioned>with the information contained in your letters,
to <location_mentioned>every part of the upper and eastern country</location_mentioned>. I presume you have of
course informed them in <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Bay Prairie</location_mentioned> from which it will go
to <location_mentioned>Colombia</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>There are some who <hi rend="italic">will not yet believe</hi> that <person_mentioned>Genl. Cos</person_mentioned> has come on—
send all the <hi rend="italic">positive </hi>information you can on this subject in a letter signed
by <person_mentioned>James Kerr</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>John Alley</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>George Sutherland</person_mentioned>, or some others who are
well known, in order that it may be printed with the signatures—
The <location_mentioned>printing press</location_mentioned> will be ready to print in this place <date_mentioned n="10-04-1835">to-morrow—</date_mentioned>you
can therefore send me what you wish to have published—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
<p>To <person_mentioned>James Kerr</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>John Alley</person_mentioned>—</p>
