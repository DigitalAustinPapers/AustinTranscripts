<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The moment I received your letter on the subject of the <location_mentioned>Lands in Texas</location_mentioned>
belonging to the Estate of our deceased friend <person_mentioned>Hawkins</person_mentioned>, I enclosed it to<barker_pb n="437"/>
<person_mentioned>S Smith Nicholas Esq. of <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; as the only person who seems to take
any interest in the affairs of the <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—and I hope he will not neglect
to act promptly on your suggestions in relation there to—. This you must
be assured is most interesting to me, as the <location_mentioned>Texas lands</location_mentioned> is the only resource
from which I can ever expect to recover a large Debt due me by that
<person_mentioned>Estate</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Have you any knowledge of the <person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>John Botts</person_mentioned> had in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>in the
[year] <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1823">1823,</date_mentioned> and in whose name the title thereof stood— There is no doubt
in the minds of all who knew the parties that the <person_mentioned>slaves </person_mentioned>were the bone fide
property of<person_mentioned> Jos: H. Hawkins</person_mentioned>, but <person_mentioned>Botts </person_mentioned>has sold them and pocketed the
money, which he refuses to account for to the <person_mentioned>Heirs </person_mentioned>or any body else— If
you should know from <person_mentioned>Botts </person_mentioned>himself or any other person (Except the <person_mentioned>Heirs</person_mentioned>)
that the <person_mentioned>slaves</person_mentioned>, between 30 and 40. were the property of <person_mentioned>Hawkins </person_mentioned>please
communicate it to myself or <person_mentioned>Judge Nicholas at <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> for we are 
determined to compell the fellow to disgorge his ill begotten means if possible—
Hoping you have entirely recovered from your late attack I remain</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Nath: Cox</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Brasoria Texas</location_mentioned></p>
