fault that we ever were otherwise—heretofore we [have] not known each
other personally as we might and ought to have— I hope for the good of
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>that we shall harmonize in future, all <person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>are injurious to our
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>at this time. We are few in numbers, and we <hi rend="italic">must </hi>be united.</p>
