<p>Sr</p>

<p>I should not trouble you with any observations on the <person_mentioned>Renaut</person_mentioned>
business, Was I not disposed to have the affair a justed, with out
difficulty, could such a thing take place or be effected, With <person_mentioned>Jones</person_mentioned>
I can say nothing more, I have recvd a most <person_mentioned>Billingsgate</person_mentioned>, letter,
with denunciations against the <location_mentioned>Claim</location_mentioned>, and what, he will do, he says 
"it is in my power to prevent your realising those Golden dreams
and, believe, me, the, <hi rend="italic">Inclination, to, do, so,</hi> is not nor shall not
be wanting.["] <hi rend="italic">the Soul, of the man, is, spoken, in, this line, it, is, in,</hi>
fact saying purchase me or I will act—the, Villing!!! <person_mentioned>Jones </person_mentioned>has
never paid a Dollar in money or in time spent, from the commence-<barker_pb n="225"/>
ment of this transaction, and from his letter I soon gather that he is
determined not to pay a Dollar, and yet expects to hold 1/4 under an
Original contract between <person_mentioned>Maj. Hunt </person_mentioned>and himself, which he knowes
was never carried into execution by him, I also find that he 
disbelieves that I am called on to pay 2647 1/2 Dollares, the purchase
money for my 1/8 of the last half of said <location_mentioned>Claim</location_mentioned>, and that he intends
paying nothing, You know that I have advanced all the money that
has been paid and from mony Drawn from the funds of <person_mentioned>Moses
Austin and Co</person_mentioned> and now because I call on him to say—Whether he
intends to consider himself interested Equal with myself in the
purchase of the last half and provide for the same say thirteen
hundred and Twenty three Dollars and fifty Cents—I am answered
in a most <person_mentioned>Billingsgate </person_mentioned>Style. If <person_mentioned>Jones </person_mentioned>has a Claim on <person_mentioned>Maj Hunt</person_mentioned>,
for a 1/4 so be it, I— have nothing to do with that contract I—
only, speak of, my contract with <person_mentioned>Maj Hunt</person_mentioned> in which I have offered,
<person_mentioned>Jones</person_mentioned>, an equal part with myself, Conditioned as above, I have
made no stipulations with <person_mentioned>Hunt </person_mentioned>for any disposal of either, <hi rend="italic">Jones</hi>,
or, <hi rend="italic">his Contract,</hi> how can any man of common understanding say
that I have acted in any way improper with, <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Jones</person_mentioned></hi>, when I gave
him an oppertunity to injoy with myself an equal participation if
he thought proper to come forward and make the proper advance
If, he, will, not, accept, <hi rend="italic">I cannot, make, him</hi></p>

<p>I have said thus much to you that hereafter I may have it in my
power to face, <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, or, any, Other, man, in Vindication of my 
Conduct, should it be called in question—</p>

<p>I have one other observation to make as respect <person_mentioned>Jones </person_mentioned>and I have
don, If <person_mentioned>Jones </person_mentioned>considers his Contract with <person_mentioned>Hunt </person_mentioned>valid, Why accuse
me of not Securing his interests in the <location_mentioned>Claim </location_mentioned>any act of mine could
not have changed his Standing with <person_mentioned>Maj Hunt</person_mentioned> unless he thought
proper to approve the same, and that he would not have don, so, is,
<hi rend="italic">clear</hi>, in as much as he objects paying or making his advance, on the
purchace, and I alone am bound to <person_mentioned>Maj Hunt</person_mentioned> for the consequences,
Such conduct is With out a parallel</p>
<p>I am Sr Yours</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Moses Austin </person_mentioned>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>again If <person_mentioned>Jones</person_mentioned>, had no expectations of being called on to pay, his
share on the last purchase money of the last half how came it to pass
that he made a provision in the contract With you that you should
pay all further and Other expenses that should Arrise on said <location_mentioned>Claims</location_mentioned>
from the day of making said Contracts in writing to me on this sub-
ject he say—" I have sold a part of my Share in the <location_mentioned>Renaut Claim</location_mentioned> to
