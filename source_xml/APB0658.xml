<p>The <person_mentioned>people of this <location_mentioned>District</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have contributed 400 fanegas of Corn 
towards the respectable support of the Representative of this province
in the <person_mentioned>Cortes</person_mentioned>, agreeably to the order of the <person_mentioned>Governor, Don Luciano
Garcia</person_mentioned>, under date of <date_mentioned n="09-24-1823">September 24th</date_mentioned>. Upon receiving your 
<person_mentioned>Excellency</person_mentioned>'s communication of the <date_mentioned n="10-06-1823">6th October</date_mentioned>, I acquainted our people
with its tenor, who have already subscribed 100 fanegas for the 
purpose alluded to in your <person_mentioned>Excellency</person_mentioned>'s aforesaid communication, and
you may send for it whenever you think proper. There is no money
in this district, and corn, is at present, the only production they
have; but wishing to prove that they are anxious to contribute,
according to their means, towards the wants of the country that has
generously received them, and which they have of their own free
will accepted as their mother country, they have made a greater
effort than was warranted by their circumstances.</p>

<p>This is in answer to your Excellency's aforesaid communication.</p>
