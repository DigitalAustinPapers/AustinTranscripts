<p><person_mentioned>Mr Jas F Perry</person_mentioned></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I am here to embark by the first vessel for <location_mentioned>N Orleans</location_mentioned>, to Meet <person_mentioned>Stephen</person_mentioned>,
raise money, send out provisions and return with all possible dispatch</p>

<p>It appears to me, it would be judicious for you to send <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and the
<person_mentioned>younger children</person_mentioned>, for altho I do not believe the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>can ever penetrate
into the <location_mentioned>heart of the Brazos timber</location_mentioned>, still I fear our hardest fighting will be
<location_mentioned>on the Colorado</location_mentioned> or <location_mentioned>upper Brazos</location_mentioned>, and the anxiety which <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>would feel
at having the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>so near, the apprehension of a possible rising of the
<person_mentioned>negroes</person_mentioned>, and the danger that the <person_mentioned>Indians </person_mentioned>may avail themselves of the 
opportunity for plunder, and make an inroad, will distress her much and 
probably impair her health—besides you would feel much relieved and be more
at liberty for personal exertions, were your <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>in a place of safety—</p>

<p>I will take charge of them, and altho the <person_mentioned>captn of the Comanche</person_mentioned> says he
shall have no room for <person_mentioned>pasengers </person_mentioned>and will take me only in consideration of
my being an old <person_mentioned>sailor</person_mentioned>, we could enduce him easily to take your <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mrs Townsend</person_mentioned> expects to go in the Commanche—</p>

<p>One of my <person_mentioned>white force</person_mentioned> has marched mounted-equiped and paid at
my cost <person_mentioned>Estis </person_mentioned>takes my best Horse, rifle pistols etc and will march with
the <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>for the <location_mentioned>Colorado reserve</location_mentioned>— He thinks strongly of forting <location_mentioned>east of
the Brazos near the timber</location_mentioned> for the Security of the <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, and as a place<barker_pb n="319"/>
of retreat, and for a bold stand in case the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>force their way <location_mentioned>acrost
the Colorado</location_mentioned>, and will do it if he can get a sufficient number to Join—
We have <location_mentioned>35 acres</location_mentioned> Corn planted and up, shall have 15 more in next week,
the <person_mentioned>negroes </person_mentioned>under <person_mentioned>Mrs Estis</person_mentioned> can tend it—but we give up the thought of
Cotton till my return and the defeat of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> I shall be here some
days to arrange my affairs and then if I can get a horse will come to your
place, and go from there to <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>to embark,</p>

<p>Should you conclude to send <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>come here and let
us make the needfull arrangements, We can at the same time finish the
business of <person_mentioned>Brown Austins Estate</person_mentioned></p>

<p>best regards to <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>and believe me truly and cordially</p>

<p><person_mentioned>H. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr Jas- F Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach Point</location_mentioned></p>
