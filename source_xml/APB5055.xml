<p><person_mentioned>Jas. F. Perry Esq</person_mentioned></p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Bearer</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Stephen Decatur Hurst Esqr. atty at Law of this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—is
my <person_mentioned>nephew</person_mentioned>—and under the influence of warm zeal and deep interest in
the sacred cause for which the <person_mentioned>Texians </person_mentioned>are nobly contending against 
despotism, bigotry and superstition, has determined to rally round the <person_mentioned>Texian</person_mentioned>
Standard and devote his energies in its defence—</p>

<p>He has been <person_mentioned>Captain </person_mentioned>of a handsome <person_mentioned>volunteer Company</person_mentioned> and recently
appointed—<person_mentioned>Colonel of a Regiment of Militia</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned>—</p><barker_pb n="262"/>

<p>He also was attached some time since to an <person_mentioned>Engineer Corps in <location_mentioned>No.
Carolina</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—and has, I believe, a pretty good knowledge of surveying—As
to his <hi rend="italic">nerve</hi>, I think I can venture to vouch for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>—Under these 
circumstances—I take the liberty of recommending my <person_mentioned>nephew </person_mentioned>to your kind
<location_mentioned>offices</location_mentioned>—and best advice—as to the most eligible plan in your opinion—for
him to pursue in order to render the most efficient aid in his power—for
the furtherance of yr. cause—and the promotion of his <hi rend="italic">individual </hi>
interests—in yr. promising <location_mentioned>region</location_mentioned>—I have but a few moments to add, that my
most inauspicious movements in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1829">1829</date_mentioned> to <location_mentioned>Potosi</location_mentioned>—has been the primary
cause, as I verily believe, of the premature death of my late invaluable
<person_mentioned>Wife </person_mentioned>and inestimable <person_mentioned>Theodosia </person_mentioned>and but <hi rend="italic">for it</hi>—my poor dear infatuate
<person_mentioned>Louisa </person_mentioned>wd not now be the <person_mentioned>Wife </person_mentioned>of a canting bigotted untalented itinerant
<person_mentioned>Methodist Preacher</person_mentioned>— This last sad event has <hi rend="italic">deeply afflicted</hi> me—I had
left her—confidingly left her—under the roof and charge of <person_mentioned>Squire Brickey
</person_mentioned>and his <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned></hi>(who lately died)—whilst I proceeded to <location_mentioned>Tennessee </location_mentioned>to attend
to some Land business and after my arrival here—arrangements were made
by <person_mentioned>Edward Hurst Esq. Notary Public</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>No. 42 Dock Street</person_mentioned>—to get her on
to this <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>—where she wd. have been comfortably situated— But alas!
in the mean time— the <hi rend="italic">very good</hi> <person_mentioned>Methodists of <location_mentioned>Potosi</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—exercised their
religious spells and incantations around her—and the poor child has 
<hi rend="italic">literally </hi>thrown herself away!— My dear Sir, my <hi rend="italic">heart </hi>is with you— in yr.
present contest and so shd. be my <hi rend="italic">arm </hi>also—(feeble as it is) did the 
situation of my <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and the state of my health admit of my joining you—a
very powerful excitement in yr. favor is rapidly spreading in <location_mentioned>Boston</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>New
York</location_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Philada</location_mentioned>. etc; and old and feeble as I am still indulge the pleasing
hope—that I may sooner or later be enabled "to wend my way"—to yr
interesting and promising <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— Do, my dear Sir, write to me as soon
as convenient <hi rend="italic">address'd</hi> to the Care of <person_mentioned>Edwd Hurst Esqr</person_mentioned> here and tell me
frankly whether my temporal prosperity and <hi rend="italic">that </hi>of my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—wd. be
likely to be promoted by a removal to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—and inform me of every
thing else you may deem <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi>—My <person_mentioned>Nephew </person_mentioned>will inform you of the
<hi rend="italic">particulars </hi>respecting my situation and <hi rend="italic">that </hi>of my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>—Please make
my most respectful regards acceptable to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Perry</person_mentioned> and all the <person_mentioned>Children</person_mentioned>—
and believe me, Dear Sir, with much respect—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Robt. Wescott.</person_mentioned></p>
