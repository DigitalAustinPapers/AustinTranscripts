<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>We presume you have seen in the <location_mentioned>papers </location_mentioned>an account of the defeat of the
<person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>fort Alamo</location_mentioned>, in <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned>, and that <person_mentioned>San tana</person_mentioned> is at the <location_mentioned>river
Nuecis</location_mentioned> with a large <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>etc</p>

<p>We have also information of all that can probably be effected at <location_mentioned>New
York</location_mentioned>—and shall go there in a few days—</p>

<p>The zeal and patriotism with which you have advocated the cause of
your <location_mentioned>adopted country</location_mentioned> has encouraged us to request that you will proceed
with as little delay as possible to <location_mentioned>Charleston south Carolina</location_mentioned>, and do all
you can to procure Men and money for our cause— The actual invation of
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>San tana</person_mentioned> requires the most prompt Measures, and we believe
that immediate presence of an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned>southern States</location_mentioned> is all 
important, We therefore hope that your business will enable you to leave <location_mentioned>N. Y.</location_mentioned>
for <location_mentioned>Charleston </location_mentioned>without delay—</p>

<p>We do not wish you to stir the subject of a public meeting at 
<location_mentioned>Philadelphia </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned>, so that you need not delay one moment on that account— Any funds you may be able to collect in the <location_mentioned>southern States</location_mentioned>, you will please
deposit with <person_mentioned>Wm Bryan the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>agent in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>In <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> you will find letters from us to the <person_mentioned>Texian Govt</person_mentioned>, to be
taken on by you, in case you should arrive there before us.</p>

<p>[Stephen F. Austin.]</p>
