<p>Messrs. <person_mentioned>R. R. Royall</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>S. Rhoads Fisher</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:</p>

<p>I am happy to inform you that the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and of liberty stands
very high in this <location_mentioned>city </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>all over the United States</location_mentioned>. The spirit of the
<person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>is aroused by the evident justice of our cause, and they will sustain
us. The universal wish and expectation in this <location_mentioned>quarter </location_mentioned>is that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>ought
to declare herself <hi rend="italic">independent at once.</hi></p>

<p>I have always been cautious and unwilling to involve the <person_mentioned>pioneers </person_mentioned>and
actual <person_mentioned>settlers of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in anything like precipitation. As to the right of<barker_pb n="300"/>
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to declare herself absolutely independent, I have no doubt; none
can possible exist; but, when I left <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>, I was not fully satisfied that we
should be sufficiently sustained. Information received here has satisfied
me on this subject. The <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> in future need not hesitate to
declare independence, from any doubts about being sustained; and, as for
myself, I am willing to go into the measure, and believe we ought to do it
without delay. ,</p>

<p>At the last accounts <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> had left <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and was rapidly 
marching on to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. He had rached <location_mentioned>San Luis Potosi</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
