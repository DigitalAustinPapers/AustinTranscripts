<p>[About July—,1824?]</p>
<p><person_mentioned>Dr. Wavel</person_mentioned> I recd a few lines from you a day or two ago without
date or signature post marked in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>you ask how I am getting
on to which I answer not very well—and I assure you I am heartily
sick of the whole business and shall gain nothing by it but losses and
fatigue, and if you wish to keep out of trouble let Colonization 
matters alone, either here or any where else—The grant I recd was to
settle <person_mentioned>300 families</person_mentioned> agreeably to the Colonization law, for which I
recd for my self 22 1/2 leagues of land—the half of which belongs to my
<person_mentioned>friend in <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> so that I have 11 1/4 Leagues for my share—you
blame me for not writing to you in <location_mentioned>London</location_mentioned>, I did write often by
way of <location_mentioned>Orleans</location_mentioned>, and if I had encouraged you to bring out goods to a
large amt. perhaps you would have blamed me more I have spent
more in this dammed affair than it will ever be worth—we are burnt
up by the drouth, and there is some Sickness—tho I still think the
country is healthy—I can return you the money you let me have, and
will secure a piece of land here for you</p>
