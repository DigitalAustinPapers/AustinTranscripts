<p>Sir</p>

<p>I received your favor of <date_mentioned n="03-05-1835">5 inst</date_mentioned>. making inquiry whether I have sent
you a Copy of my "Exposition," as you suspect one had been purloined in
the <location_mentioned>Post office</location_mentioned>, of <location_mentioned>that place</location_mentioned>, which had been directed to you. I think it
probable your suspicion is well founded for I sent one to you, one to the
<person_mentioned>Ayuntamiento </person_mentioned>and one to <person_mentioned>Smith</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I now send you an other copy which I hope may reach you.</p>

<p>I am still here a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>, on bail, and cannot make any certain
calculations as [to] when I shall be able to leave, tho' hope in all <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1835">next
month</date_mentioned>.</p>

the Settlement of the <person_mentioned>families </person_mentioned>he contracted with the <person_mentioned>State Governt</person_mentioned> and<barker_pb n="56"/>
that he expects them out from <location_mentioned>Ireland </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Germany </location_mentioned>in a short time. I
wish him every success in this enterprise, for it is an arduous one, and
also will be very usefull to the Country which needs population. Should
it be in my pwer to serve him in any way I will cheerfully do so. My
respects to <person_mentioned>Doctor Beales</person_mentioned> and also to <person_mentioned>Powers </person_mentioned>on the <location_mentioned>Nueces </location_mentioned>when you
