<p>Stephen F. Austin to his mother, January 20, 1821. Hardships of the family. Business depression in New Orleans.   Friendship of Joseph H. Hawkins.</p>

<p>[New Orleans, January 20, 1821.]</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Elias Bates</person_mentioned> arrived here this day in a Steam Boat from 
<location_mentioned>Alexandria </location_mentioned>; he went as far as the <location_mentioned>Sabine </location_mentioned>and heard that <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>had arrived
at <location_mentioned>St Antonio </location_mentioned>and was to be back at <location_mentioned>Natchitoches </location_mentioned>by the <date_mentioned n="02-15-1820">15th of
February</date_mentioned>; he was well. I know nothing as to my <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>'s objects or
prospects. <person_mentioned>Elias </person_mentioned>will remain in the country until my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>returns.
As to <person_mentioned>Bryan </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Sister </person_mentioned>my heart bleeds for their troubles—if I
can be of any servise to you or them let me know it, and I will go
home; I will do anything that is right. My reputation is <hi rend="italic">all </hi>I have
on earth, if <hi rend="italic">that </hi>is destroyed I can be of no use to you or any one
else, and there will no longer [be] a necessity of my remaining either
in this <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>or any other.</p>

<p>I came here with a hope of getting employ; I offered to hire myself
out as <person_mentioned>clerk</person_mentioned>, as an <person_mentioned>overseer</person_mentioned>, or anything else, but business is too dull
here to get into business. There are hundreds of young men who are
glad to work for their board. I met with <person_mentioned>Kenner</person_mentioned>; he <hi rend="italic">said </hi>he would
befriend me, but I have not seen him since. In this state of things it
was my good fortune to get acquainted with <person_mentioned>Joseph H. Hawkins Esqr</person_mentioned>.
(formerly of <location_mentioned>Lexington Kentucky</location_mentioned>) who gave me employ in an <location_mentioned>office</location_mentioned>.
He is a man who in every respect is an honor, and an ornament to the
human race. He has kindly advanced me money enough to purchase
a few groceries for you and <person_mentioned>sister</person_mentioned>, which I have shipped on board
the Velocipede <person_mentioned>Capt. Beckwith</person_mentioned>; enclosed is a Bill of lading; and I
will send $10 in a letter by the boat toward paying the freight; this
is all I can do now—when I earn some more I will send another
supply and will try to keep you and <person_mentioned>Bryan's family</person_mentioned> supplied with
sugar and Coffee at least.</p><barker_pb n="374"/>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Hawkins</person_mentioned> is a <person_mentioned>lawyer </person_mentioned>of the [highest] standing in this place-
he is not rich—but he has a most generous heart—he has made me
this offer—if I will remain with him he will board me, permit me the
use of his books, and money for clothes, give me all the instruction in
his power until I am well fitted to commence the practice of law
in this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>—for my board and the use of his books he will charge
<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, and for the money he advances he will wait until I make
enough by my profession to repay him; an offer so generous and
from a man who two months ago was a stranger to me, has almost
made me change my opinion of the human race. There are however
two obstacles in the way; one is that I shall earn nothing to help you
with, for at least 18 months; another is that perhaps those I owe in
<location_mentioned>Missouri </location_mentioned>may prosecute here; it will do them no good I have
nothing—all the property I had in <location_mentioned>Arkansas</location_mentioned>, I gave to <person_mentioned>Father</person_mentioned>. If I
am left alone a few years I may get up and pay all off; it will take
me 18 months to become acquainted with civil law which is in force
in this country and learn the French language-—that once done I
then shall have the means of fortune within my reach. I am 
determined to accept of <person_mentioned>Hawkins </person_mentioned>offer.</p>

<p>I have been engaged in aiding to edit a <location_mentioned>newspaper</location_mentioned>, the <location_mentioned>"Louisiana
Advertiser "</location_mentioned> I have sent some numbers to <person_mentioned>Post Master <location_mentioned>Herculaneum</location_mentioned>
</person_mentioned>which you now doubt can get</p>

<p>Your <person_mentioned>Son</person_mentioned></p>
