<p>[About May 1, 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir:—After a long and tedious journey, I am at length at
the <location_mentioned>fountain head of the <hi rend="italic">new born nation</hi></location_mentioned>. All I will say at 
present, (in regard to the country over which I have passed, since I left
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>,) is, that no one after reading <person_mentioned>Humboldt </person_mentioned>and other <person_mentioned>writers</person_mentioned>,
can pass through this country without being sorely disappointed at<barker_pb n="505"/>
every step. The <location_mentioned>nation</location_mentioned>, however, possesses great resources, and its
vast and successful effort for independence combined with the 
general harmony which at this time prevails, furnish, I think, sure
pledges of future greatness and prosperity.</p>

<p>In regard to my <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, I have only been here a
few days and I have not had time for the full examination of my
papers by <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>. I found the <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>here fully informed,
(through the <person_mentioned>Governor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>), of all that had been done in 
relation to the grant; the steps I had taken, and the progress of the
<location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>— so far all seems satisfactory, and I can, I think, safely
assure you, that <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>will in a few days sanction all that has
been done, as well as the measures necessary to the future 
prosperity of the <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>We have just heard of the acknowledgement of the independence
of this <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>by the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>—an event exciting the most
lively sensations here—and fraught I hope, with solid and lasting
benefits to both nations.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>here do business in good order and with great 
deliberation, though rather slow; and the most perfect harmony 
prevails, notwithstanding the existence of two parties, Imperial and
Republican.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen. Iturbide</person_mentioned> seems to have the happiness of his <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>much
at heart, and I have no doubt he will act as a great and good man
ought to do.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen. Wilkinson</person_mentioned> arrived here two days ago— you will be gratified
to learn he possesses the confidence of this <person_mentioned>government </person_mentioned>in a high 
degree, receives the most distinguished attentions, resides at the <location_mentioned>house
of the Captain General of this province</location_mentioned>, where he was waited on
shortly after his arrival by <person_mentioned>Gen. Iturbide</person_mentioned>, and the <person_mentioned>members of the
regency</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Mr. <person_mentioned>Irwin </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Leftwich </person_mentioned>are here—their petition for a <location_mentioned>grant </location_mentioned>of
land is before <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, and will be acted on in a few days.</p>

<p>There are also two <person_mentioned>European </person_mentioned>applicants for <person_mentioned>grants</person_mentioned>, one 
proposing the settlement of 5000 <person_mentioned>Irish emigrants</person_mentioned>, and the other 8000 
<person_mentioned>German</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen. Trespelacias</person_mentioned> has been appointed <person_mentioned>Governor of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Gen.
Long</person_mentioned> was killed a short time since by a <person_mentioned>sentry</person_mentioned>—his <person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>and his
men will, I think, be provided for.</p>

<p>I hope to set out for the <location_mentioned>settlement in Texas</location_mentioned>, in the course of ten
or twelve days.</p>

<p>With sentitments of sincere esteem I am, etc</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. T. [F.] Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Jos. H. Hawkins, Esq.</person_mentioned></p>
