<div1 type="body">

<p>In the month of <date_mentioned n="08-xx-1822">August 1822</date_mentioned> I was employed by <person_mentioned>Mr Jn° Hanna</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Israel Massey</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>La Bahia</location_mentioned> as an <person_mentioned>interpreter </person_mentioned>to assist them in
their business during the time of my being with them <person_mentioned>Mr Freeman
Pettus</person_mentioned> came there on business with <person_mentioned>Mr. Hanna</person_mentioned>, and previous to his
departure <person_mentioned>Mr. Hanna</person_mentioned> requested him to call (on his way home) at
<person_mentioned>Judge Cummins</person_mentioned>'s and take possession of a number of Horses and
Mules that were there belonging to sd <person_mentioned>Hanna</person_mentioned>, employ a person to
assist him and drive them from there to <person_mentioned>Mr. Pettus's Brother</person_mentioned> on the
<location_mentioned>San Jasinto</location_mentioned> w[h]ere they were to be taken care of until <person_mentioned>Mr. Hanna</person_mentioned>
would call for them on his way to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>: I never heard
<person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> say to the contrary and believed of course the Horses and
mules were considered at his risk <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned> acting only as the
<person_mentioned>friend of Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> and<person_mentioned> Mr H</person_mentioned> paying all expenses, on the way as
I was afterwards informed the Cavellada Stampeded and a part of
the horses and mules were not recovered, still I heard nothing said
of <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned> being considered liable for the accident until I was
informed by <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> that he had received a letter from <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned>
informing him of the accident and that <person_mentioned>Mr H</person_mentioned>. should loose nothing
by it, (or words to that amount) Of the number of those Horses
and Mules their were ten that had been allotted by <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> for
the payment of some Coffee sugar and rice that belonged to <person_mentioned>Mr
Manifee of <location_mentioned>Alabama</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> which property <person_mentioned>Hanna </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Massey </person_mentioned>had in
their possession and sold for their benefit previous to the departure
of <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> he requested me as I was 
knowing to the circumstances of the stampede etc. to give him a certificate
that to the best of my knowledge the mules allotted for <person_mentioned>Mr Manifee</person_mentioned>
were in the Cavellada that stampeded and that the whole of the
Cavellada had never been recovered and that <person_mentioned>Mr Manifee</person_mentioned> as part
<person_mentioned>owner </person_mentioned>must bear part of the loss. <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned> while in <location_mentioned>Labahia </location_mentioned>was
at some expense for board provisions for his return and I believe some<barker_pb n="700"/>
little money <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> let him have the amt of the whole was to the
best of my recollection between forty and forty five Dollars which
sum was considered as to appear against <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned>'s charge for
attending to the transportation of the Cavellada. The 
aforementioned Horses and Mules I know were considered by <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned>
(with the exception of three or four mules) of an indifferent
quality. <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned> having told me that the person with whom he
traded <person_mentioned>Mr David Price of <location_mentioned>Labahia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> had cheated him in the quality
of the animals having delivered those of an indifferent quality: I
was afterwards informed by <person_mentioned>Mr Price</person_mentioned> that he had not given Horses
and Mules of good quality owing to <person_mentioned>Mr Hanna</person_mentioned>'s taking him in, in
the price of the goods given in payment for them.</p>

<p>In the month of <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1823">February </date_mentioned>I was at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Groces</person_mentioned>' place on the Brasos</location_mentioned>
when <person_mentioned>Mr Massey</person_mentioned> came there and informed <person_mentioned>Mr G</person_mentioned>. he was in possession
of a note given by <person_mentioned>Mr William Pettus</person_mentioned> which he wished him to buy or
he <person_mentioned>Massey </person_mentioned>would attach a <person_mentioned>Negro </person_mentioned>and sell it to <person_mentioned>Mr Groce</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr G.</person_mentioned>
informed <person_mentioned>Mr Massey</person_mentioned> that he had once had a <person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>of <person_mentioned>Mr Pettus</person_mentioned>'s
living with him and that there had been a difference between them
and he was fearful that <person_mentioned>Mr William Pettus</person_mentioned> would think that <person_mentioned>Mr
Groce</person_mentioned> in purchasing the note or <person_mentioned>negro </person_mentioned>acted from feelings of
private animosity and declined having anything to do with it. <person_mentioned>Mr
Massey</person_mentioned> staid at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Groce</person_mentioned>'s</location_mentioned> two days and nights endeavoring to 
induce <person_mentioned>Mr G.</person_mentioned> to trade with him. <person_mentioned>Mr Groce </person_mentioned>declined and <person_mentioned>Massey </person_mentioned>then
said he would go to the <person_mentioned>alcalde </person_mentioned>and get out an attachment. <person_mentioned>Mr
Groce</person_mentioned> advised him not and told [him] he believed he would be able to
arrange it without sueing.</p>
