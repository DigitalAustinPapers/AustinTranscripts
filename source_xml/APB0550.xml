<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>as soon as I arrived here as <person_mentioned>Governor </person_mentioned>of this <location_mentioned>province </location_mentioned>I endeavored
to promote its welfare. I directed the <person_mentioned>inhabitants of the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
to appoint an <person_mentioned>alcalde </person_mentioned>of their own choice to administer justice, and
organize the <person_mentioned>militia </person_mentioned>to oppose the <person_mentioned>Karankawas </person_mentioned>or other <person_mentioned>intruders</person_mentioned>
who might attack their persons or their property. I provided the
wants of some distant <location_mentioned>settlements </location_mentioned>who petitioned for the protection
of the <person_mentioned>Government</person_mentioned>. The presence of several <person_mentioned>Indian chiefs</person_mentioned> in this
place gave me the opportunity to bring to an understanding nations
who had been heretofore at war. Though the plan of colonization
is not yet known. I am confident it shall be drawn up upon liberal
principles and will afford to industrious emigrants the advantage of
a rich soil fit for every kind of crops. I expect shortly a strong
reinforcement of <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>and intend to visit with them the <location_mentioned>province</location_mentioned>
and leave <person_mentioned>detachments </person_mentioned>at the most important points to protect the
<person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>travellers</person_mentioned>. While I am waiting with anxiety the means
of contributing to the final happiness of this section of the <location_mentioned>Empire</location_mentioned>
I feel myself somewhat disappointed in my expectations in seeing a
band of <person_mentioned>villains </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Spaniards </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>americans </person_mentioned>actually engaged in 
stealing mules and horses and so bring them with impunity to the <location_mentioned>United
States</location_mentioned>. The existence of this set of <person_mentioned>robbers </person_mentioned>cannot be but prejudicial
to the <person_mentioned>inhabitants </person_mentioned>of both countries, there fore I take the liberty
to ask your opinion upon the measures which are better calculated
to stop such criminal a traffic. Should you find yourself authorised
to help me in obtaining this desirable object, I shall have reason to
congratulate both your philanthropy and my own good fortune.—-If
you have any command for this place or for any other where my
credit might be of some service to you, sir, please dispose with 
confidence of</p>

<p>[José Felix Trespalacios.]</p>
