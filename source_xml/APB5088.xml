<p><location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-22-1835">Dec.r 22. 1835</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The best interests of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, I think require that the war should be kept
<location_mentioned>out of this country</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>beyond the rio grande</location_mentioned>. On this principle I was in
favor of fitting out <person_mentioned>Col Gonzales</person_mentioned> and did everything I could to do so. I
was, and am in favor of giving to <person_mentioned>Genl. Mexia</person_mentioned> and his <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>what aid we
could, and generally of affording assistance to the <person_mentioned>federl party</person_mentioned> in the 
<location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned>by such <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">auxiliary </hi>forces</person_mentioned> as we could spare. I have been and am 
opposed to any measures that will give to the <person_mentioned>central govt. in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> any
foundation to say that the <person_mentioned>Texan </person_mentioned>war, is purely a national war against 
<person_mentioned>foreigners </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>foreign invaders</person_mentioned>— In short I have thought, and still think that
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should rigidly adhere to the leading principles of the declaration of<barker_pb n="291"/>
<date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Nov.r last</date_mentioned>. By so doing we preserve our character for consistency and
good faith.</p>

<p>I will here observe, that in my communication to the <person_mentioned>provisional govt</person_mentioned>.
of <date_mentioned n="12-02-1835">2d instant</date_mentioned> recommending the convocation of a convention on the basis
of equal representation, I objected to the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">1 Nov.r</date_mentioned> as being
liable to [mis]construction. Perhaps I ought to state the extent and nature
of my objection—it is this— The declaration does not declare <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to be
a <location_mentioned>state of the Mexican confederation</location_mentioned>, which I think it ought to have done,
subject however to all the other provisions and principles established in
it— This would have given a fixed and definite character to the political
position of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and concentrated public opinion, and at the same time
left her the option of reuniting with <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>or not hereafter, according as
the federal constitution when reestablished conformed or not to the 
republican principles of the federal system, for it is to be remembered that the
declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">Novr. 7</date_mentioned> does not adhere to all the anti-republican features
and defects of the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1834">1824</date_mentioned>, it only adheres to its <hi rend="italic">republican
principles</hi> and to the federal system.</p>

<p>It is well known that the object of the <person_mentioned>federal party of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> at this
time is to reform the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date_mentioned>so as to expunge all its 
anti-republican principles. Our declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Nov.r</date_mentioned> in this respect is therefore
in strict conformity with the basis on which the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> are acting</p>

<p>But it is objected that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>cannot declare herself a <location_mentioned>state of the 
Mexican confederation</location_mentioned>, unless she does so under the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date_mentioned>with
all its defects etc. To this I answer, that, the dissolution of the social 
compact and the present physical situation of all <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>gives to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>the <hi rend="italic">right</hi>
of declaring herself an <location_mentioned>independent community</location_mentioned>— This being the case she
certainly has the right to do much less, that is, to say she will continue
united with the <location_mentioned>Mexican confederation</location_mentioned>, provided the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> succeed
in reestablishing the federal system on truly <person_mentioned>republican </person_mentioned>principles, free
from the defects of the constitution of <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date_mentioned>, at the same time offering her
aid to that <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>to effect this object.</p>

<p>As to independence— I think it will strengthen the cause of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to
show that we have <hi rend="italic">legal </hi>and <hi rend="italic">equitable </hi>and <hi rend="italic">just </hi>grounds to declare 
independence, and under this view I touched upon this subject in, my 
communication to the provisional Govt. of <date_mentioned n="11-30-1835">30.th ultimo</date_mentioned>. But I also think that it will
weaken <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and expose the <person_mentioned>old settlers</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>men of property</person_mentioned> in this 
<location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>to much risk, to make such a declaration at this time, and under the
present circumstances, for the reason that it will turn all <person_mentioned>parties in <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>
against us—bring back the war to our own doors, which is now removed
from <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>by the fall of <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, and compel the people to seek aid at any
sacrifice.— I do not think it necessary to run any such risk, for the natural
current of events will soon regulate everything. A large portion of the<barker_pb n="292"/>
<person_mentioned>Mexicans </person_mentioned>are determined to be free. If they succeed, <person_mentioned>Texas </person_mentioned>will participate
as a <location_mentioned>state </location_mentioned>in conformity with the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7 Novr</date_mentioned>-—if they fail, <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
can at any time resort to her natural rights.</p>

<p>There are about <person_mentioned>200 volunteers</person_mentioned> here, and probably will be a 1000 of more
in a <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1836">month</date_mentioned>. What is to be done with them? They must and ought to be
provided for and employed— I think that <location_mentioned>head quarters</location_mentioned> should be fixed at
<location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, and that a <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>federal auxiliary army</person_mentioned></hi> should be collected there, and
offered to the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> should it be needed by them. This will be in
conformity with our own offers in the 2.d article of the declaration of <date_mentioned n="11-07-1835">7
Novr-</date_mentioned> and it will also place <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, on a footing as to the <person_mentioned>federal party</person_mentioned> that
will justify the former in expecting remuneration from the latter for what
she spends in aid of the federal cause by furnishing <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>auxiliary forces</person_mentioned></hi></p>

<p>I write this letter as a <person_mentioned>citizen of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and not as a <person_mentioned>commissioner</person_mentioned>— I
give my opinions frankly and refer you to <person_mentioned>Col Fannin</person_mentioned> for a further 
explanation of them, I believe that this <person_mentioned>meritorious officer</person_mentioned> and myself do not
differ materially on these subjects.</p>
