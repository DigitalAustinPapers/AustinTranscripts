<p>Santa Anna's visit to Washington. Expects annexation. Speculations of McKinney and Williams</p>

<div1 type="body">

<p>Dr. <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I am anxious to hear how you are. the last accounts you were getting
better I shall be at <location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>at the <location_mentioned>Ball </location_mentioned>and from there go down— I am
gaining strength so slowly that it is difficult to perseive much improvement
in my strength—</p>

<p>I think that matters will go on well and smoothly in both the <person_mentioned>Executive
and Legislative departments</person_mentioned>— There evidently is a disposition to 
harmonise in all persons.</p>

<p>I have been solicited to go into the new <person_mentioned>cabinet</person_mentioned> as <person_mentioned>Secretary of State</person_mentioned>—
or to go to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> as <person_mentioned>minister</person_mentioned>— I have declined— I have all the land
office business to close— Who can I trust it with in my absence? If <person_mentioned>S. M.
Williams</person_mentioned> failed me while I was in <location_mentioned>prison in the city of Mexico</location_mentioned>, who can I
hope will not fail me?</p>

<p>Besides all this my health is gone, and I must have rest to nurse my 
constitution and try and restore my strength— The <location_mentioned>land office</location_mentioned> will be as
much as I can attend to in the present state of my health.</p>

<p>I think I shall effect a sale of some tracts of land, tho, at a great 
sacrifice; which will supply me with something to live on, for the present untill
I raise means to settle a <location_mentioned>farm</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I send you by <person_mentioned>Simon </person_mentioned>two slips of Roses which I brought <date_mentioned n="10-24-1836">yesterday </date_mentioned>from
<location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Dr Phelps</person_mentioned>' place</location_mentioned>, The largest slip is monthly, white, exceedingly 
fragrant, as much so as damask rose—it forms a <hi rend="italic">tree</hi>—it is very rare in the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and was procured from abroad by a <person_mentioned>botanist in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans </location_mentioned></person_mentioned>who gave
a slip to <person_mentioned>Phelps</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The other slip blooms <hi rend="italic">daily </hi>the year round is red and fragrant—</p>

<p>Do take care of them—water them every night untill they take root
I also send you black walnuts <hi rend="italic">to plant</hi> They are from a tree that <person_mentioned>Bell</person_mentioned>
planted in his yard after he settled where he now is— They ought to be
planted in <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1837">January </date_mentioned>Do not neglect them, nor let the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>eat them—
If I am here in the <date_mentioned n="Winter-1836">winter </date_mentioned>I will go to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mrs Allsbury</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> and get some slips and
roots for you</p>

<p>Have you saved any more of the crow foot Grass seed— A small patch
in <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Bell</person_mentioned>s yard</location_mentioned> has supported about a dozen Horses and kept them fat— He<barker_pb n="439"/>
says he never has seen any grass half so valuable for a <location_mentioned>pasture</location_mentioned>— Do not
neglect this—set <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Joel </person_mentioned>or the <person_mentioned>children </person_mentioned>to gathering the seed</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen Jackson</person_mentioned> has answered <person_mentioned>Santanna</person_mentioned>'s letter of <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4 July</date_mentioned> in a very friendly
manner—he has made it the basis of an offer of mediation with <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and
open.d a correspondence with the <person_mentioned>Mexican Minister at Washington</person_mentioned> Those
who cursed and were for hanging me for going to see <person_mentioned>Santana</person_mentioned> at all, or
getting him to write to <person_mentioned>Jackson</person_mentioned>, now say that I was right,—that measure
<hi rend="italic">then </hi>so bad, is now looked to as one of the best modes of bringing about a
peace <person_mentioned>Gen. Houston</person_mentioned>'s ideas as to <person_mentioned>santana </person_mentioned>agree very much with mine.</p>

<p>I have <hi rend="italic">full confidence</hi> that all will go right—and that by <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1837">next March</date_mentioned> we
shall belong to the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> I wish to take the trip to Washington—but who
can I trust to close the land business? If <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>failed
me in my absence and forgeting their duty to their country became wild
and gambling <person_mentioned>land jobbers</person_mentioned>—who can I trust? I know of no one but <person_mentioned>Gail
Borden</person_mentioned> He <hi rend="italic">can be trusted</hi>, for he is conscienciously an honest man, but
if he refused to chime in with the views of <person_mentioned>speculators </person_mentioned>they would seek
some way to ruin him— My confidence in mankind is so destroyed by
<person_mentioned>W.</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>McK.</person_mentioned> in whom I had unbounded confidence that I am fast falling
or have fallen into the opposite extreme to the principle that always 
governed me— I once believed all men honest untill the reverse appeared—
I now think all the reverse untill I see them tryed— Love to <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>
and all</p>

<p><location_mentioned>Columbia </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="10-25-1836">July [October] 25. 1836</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr James F. Perry</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Peach point</location_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Simon</person_mentioned></p>
