<p>Statement concerning the eleven league grants that he bought in 1832. Other property. Business instructions to Perry </p>

<div1 type="body">

<p>I purchased <location_mentioned>three eleven league tracts</location_mentioned> of <person_mentioned>Aguirrie of <location_mentioned>Saltillo</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. The power
of attorney to take possession of this land and sell it was given to <person_mentioned>Wil-<barker_pb n="287"/>
liams</person_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Aguirrie</person_mentioned>. Of these tracts one was sold to <person_mentioned>Mr. St John</person_mentioned> by 
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>with my consent. One was sold to <person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned> without my consent
and one still belongs to me and was located by me <location_mentioned>on the east side of 
Colorado at the foot of the mountains</location_mentioned> surveyed by <person_mentioned>Fernando Rodriguiz</person_mentioned> which
I paid him for and left with <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>. All these things will be fairly stated
and settled by <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>, I have no doubt. I wish you to attend to it all
and all my business as well as you can, but not to involve yourself in any
way in any of my affairs. I gave <person_mentioned>Austin Bryan</person_mentioned> a note on James H. Bell (I
think that is his name) for fifteen cows and calves to be delivered at his
<location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned><location_mentioned>nearly opposite San Felipe</location_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="04-15-1836">15 April next</date_mentioned>. Drive them to
<location_mentioned>Chocolate</location_mentioned>. I indorced the note to be credited in my a/c for money 
advanced by you for me when in <location_mentioned>mexico</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I wish the title for the <location_mentioned>land </location_mentioned>belonging to me that is in my <person_mentioned>brother</person_mentioned>s name
which I purchased from others, transfered to me by order of <person_mentioned>court</person_mentioned>, as soon
as it can be done My part of the <location_mentioned>matagorda tract</location_mentioned> is one of them, which I
got from <person_mentioned>Whiteman </person_mentioned>[Wightman] by exchanging other land for it.</p>

<p>I wish to adopt <person_mentioned>Stephen F. (my brothers son)</person_mentioned> and that he should be
delivered up to me, to be dealt by as my own <person_mentioned>son</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I wish you to make titles in my name for the <person_mentioned>Brasoria lots</person_mentioned> that have
been sold.</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="12-17-1835">Dec.r 17. 1835</date_mentioned>	<person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>As regards the <person_mentioned>upper colony</person_mentioned>—I have never yet rec'd. one cent. I have
had nothing to do with it. My name has been used for the benifit of others
and I have rec'd. all the abuse and calumny. <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>knows all about it.</p>
