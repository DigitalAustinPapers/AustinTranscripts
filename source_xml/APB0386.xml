<p>I have after much delay and difficulty obtained my account from
the <location_mentioned>Bank of St Louis</location_mentioned> and after settling <person_mentioned>S F. Austin</person_mentioned>'s account, Debt,
and Interest also my own I am in debt to the bank (280 Dollars
which is payable in three years so that after much difficulty and an
ungodly sacrefice I shall clear myself and family from Debt all my
other business is nearly closed and after collecting every Cent
against me in this town it amounts only to about (550) Dollars
which sweeps ray Debt the Judgment of <person_mentioned>Butler</person_mentioned>s excepted—and I
have not given up any property as yet, but I must do so as I cannot
settle that Demand in any other way—¦</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wiggins </person_mentioned>has made use of my stock say ten shares some two years
past and had <person_mentioned>Mr Pettibone</person_mentioned> don[e] his duty he could never have
obtained a judgment. I wash my hands of that business by a Bill
in chancery—which I shall file <date_mentioned n="04-23-1821">on the Morrow</date_mentioned>—after which I hope
to leave <location_mentioned>St Louis</location_mentioned>. I think that you had better attend to your Debt

things in a situation to take the benefit of the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, a Day aught
not to be lost in settling with him. I pray make a little exertion to
send in something for <person_mentioned>Brown </person_mentioned>(50)  Dollars will now release him<barker_pb n="389"/>

go with me to <person_mentioned>Texas  </person_mentioned>your <person_mentioned>mother </person_mentioned>is recently distressed for 
common necessaries   she is out of flour and meat</p>
