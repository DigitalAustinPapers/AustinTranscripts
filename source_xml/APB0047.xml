<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I received your favors not long since and am very Sorry to hear
of the Difficulties you have met with in the progress of your bussi-<barker_pb n="58"/>
ness but hope you will yet be well repaid for all your trouble, I
should have wrote you long since but as I supposed from the 
frequent communications from my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mr. Jas Austin</person_mentioned> you were
informed of our proceedings generally in this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>. Your 
objections as to the Sale of some of the property sold me by my <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>, I
am sorry to hear of as I rested perfectly satisfied as to my right of
all the Property and Still shall as I am certain you must be much
deceived as to the Value of the Property, by a letter from my <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>
I am informed that you write by the appraisement of myself and <person_mentioned>Jas
Austin</person_mentioned> the Property at the <location_mentioned>Lead Mines</location_mentioned> Amounts to 25,000 Dollars,
as to myself I think I can with certainty say I never made such a
Statement nor had such an Idea, if <person_mentioned>Mr. James Austin</person_mentioned> did so I think
you must have misunderstood each other very much Indeed, I rely
much on his judgment and integrity and as he has wrote his <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>he
intends going to your Country from <location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>you will verbally 
receive more accurate information from him I should long before this
have had all the Property Valued but on my own account rested easy,
but for the better adjustment of Accounts between yourself and my
<person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>I shall in a few days have all the Property valued by <person_mentioned>Mr.
James McGarock, Senr</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr. Hugh McGarock</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Mr. Joseph Kent</person_mentioned> and
<person_mentioned>Capt. James Newell</person_mentioned> four persons in whom I place much 
confidence and who I think will do justice to both parties. I shall State
to them (by the direction of <person_mentioned>S. Austin</person_mentioned>) that the Property is to be
valued at cash which he (<person_mentioned>S. A.</person_mentioned>) says ought to have been sold to 
discharge your assumset to him some time since, I have hereunto 
annexed a Statement of the most I think the Property would bring in
the common way of Trade in this <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>which can be compared
with the balance due <person_mentioned>S. Austin and Co. of <location_mentioned>Philada</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> by <person_mentioned>Mosses Austin
and Co</person_mentioned>. and <person_mentioned>S & M Austin of <location_mentioned>Virginia</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> which I think will not be
more than adequate to the sum due. Since the adjustment of your
accounts in <location_mentioned>Philada </location_mentioned>with my <person_mentioned>father </person_mentioned>(with the interest which he may
or may not be intitled to) he has paid a very considerable debt and
advanced some money for this place. Should I have erred in any
Statement I have made above or any opinion I have advanced, in the
manner in which they are made, I beg to be corrected, my wish and
most ernest desire is that no difference or litigation should take place
in any bussiness I may have that has any relation to yourself.</p>

<p>Since the <date_mentioned n="06-18-1800">18 of June last</date_mentioned> on my Lease for one Year of the <location_mentioned>Lead
Mines</location_mentioned>, I have been pursuing the Bussiness with as much Prudence,
caution and care as my moderate abillities has enabled me and
fear at the close of the year I shall barely be able to pay all 
expenses, I have not raised any ore of consequence for many months,
but the prospect holding good has prevented my abandoning some
time back but since I have built a Slag Hourth which I erected at
the  <location_mentioned>Grist Mills</location_mentioned> notwithstanding the  quantity  of  water  does  not<barker_pb n="59"/>
answer my expectations we work nearly one half of the time. I shall
hold on untile the expiration of my year and shall then remain
the ballance of the <date_mentioned n="Summer - 1801">summer </date_mentioned>to adjust my accounts when with what
little I may have after my four Years labour I shall seek some 
employment near my <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, my <location_mentioned>plantation (B. Bottom</location_mentioned>) I shall leave
in the care of some trusty person with several <person_mentioned>hands </person_mentioned>and shall return
to this <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>as my <person_mentioned>father</person_mentioned>s and my own interest may require.</p>

<p>In the Statement which follows I have not included for 2 Small
Pieces of Land or <location_mentioned>B. Bottom </location_mentioned>nor the Tolls or Debts due the place
which will not discharge the debts due from it in this Country.</p>

<p>Remember me to <person_mentioned>Aunt </person_mentioned>and the <person_mentioned>Children </person_mentioned>and all <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>with you.</p>
