<p>Dear Sir </p>                                                                              

<p>The note, received with your favor of <date_mentioned n="07-03-1818">3rd Instanst</date_mentioned>, has been offered
at every meeting of the <person_mentioned>Board </person_mentioned>since it came to hand; it was not 
decided on untill <date_mentioned n="07-22-1818">to-day</date_mentioned>. The <person_mentioned>Board </person_mentioned>have come to a determination
to call in the usual reduction of 10 per centum on all notes of the
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Directors</person_mentioned></hi>, as well as those of other individuals. They have however
agreed to renew your notes at present for the whole amount, 
subject to 20 per cent reduction at the next renewal; but they require
that the original forms of the notes (as to endorsers) shall be 
preserved—rejecting the proposition to consolidate them. In order that
your object may in some measure be effected I have made out the
enclosed statement of interest computed to this day; at which time
the notes can be all dated, and the extra trouble of attending to their
renewals at different times can be saved.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Wm  M. OHara</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>P. S. I also laid the proposition before the <person_mentioned>Board </person_mentioned>to renew <person_mentioned>Mr.
Bryan</person_mentioned>'s notes, but, as the notes intended to be renewed are not yet
due, they did not act upon his proposal: consequently I could not
send you his old notes (as requested) by <person_mentioned>Mr Brown</person_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Mr Bryan</person_mentioned> has a
note payle next week, for which <person_mentioned>Mr. Ficklin</person_mentioned> has a notice.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr Stephen F. Austin</person_mentioned>.   <location_mentioned>Mine-a-Breton</location_mentioned>.</p>
