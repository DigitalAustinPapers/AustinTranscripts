<p><location_mentioned>Port of Goliad</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-25-1835">Oct, 25 '35</date_mentioned></p>
<p>8 oClock in the evening.</p>
<p>To <person_mentioned>Gen Stephen F. Austin,
Com. in ch.</person_mentioned> of the <person_mentioned>Army of the People</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Yours of the <date_mentioned n="10-21-1835">21t. inst</date_mentioned>., a postscrip to that of <person_mentioned>Padillo </person_mentioned>of the same date—
yours also of the <date_mentioned n="10-22-1835">22d.</date_mentioned> and <date_mentioned n="10-23-1835">23d. instants</date_mentioned>, and recd, at 4 oClock P. M. <date_mentioned n="10-25-1835">to
day</date_mentioned>, are duly noted.</p><barker_pb n="208"/>

<p>The supplies which you call for shall be forwarded immediately. The
teams, 5 or 6 in number, and more if they can be procured, shall be put in
motion <date_mentioned n="10-26-1835">tomorrow evening</date_mentioned>, or <date_mentioned n="10-27-1835">early next day morning</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Nothing has transpired relative to our liability to attack at <location_mentioned>this place</location_mentioned>,
since the date of my last by hand of <person_mentioned>Mr Bracken</person_mentioned>, worthy your attention. At
the date of that communication, I addressed the <person_mentioned>people residing <location_mentioned>east of the
Guardeloupe</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, urging the necessity of a reinforcement, and have much 
reason to expect some increase of force from the sections of Country 
mentioned in- yours of the <date_mentioned n="10-23-1835">23d. inst</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>You enquire after <person_mentioned>Linn </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Powers</person_mentioned>—Both, altho' absent at the moment,
have been with me, have acted in concert, and have been very useful to the
service. They will probably return <date_mentioned n="10-25-1835">to night</date_mentioned>, or <date_mentioned n="10-26-1835">tomorrow</date_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>Col. Powers</person_mentioned>
became very much alarmed for the safety of his people, (nearly all the men
being here,) occasioned by information received by him from a <person_mentioned>confidential
friend at <location_mentioned>San Patricio</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>: In consequence of which, steps have been taken to
remove the <person_mentioned>women </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>children</person_mentioned>,<location_mentioned> beyond the Guardeloupe River</location_mentioned>. Being
informed that this removal is now nearly, or quite accomplished I expect
to see the <person_mentioned>Emprisario of <location_mentioned>that Coloney</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> here immediately. Supplies for the
poor of these <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, and for <person_mentioned>recruits</person_mentioned>, have been forwarded hence to the
<location_mentioned>Town of Guardeloupe Victoria</location_mentioned> This step was recommended too, by the
possibility of our being compelled to fall back on that point—one of the
most defensible, by a <person_mentioned>small force</person_mentioned>, of any whatever in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>For some reason or other the people of<location_mentioned> this place</location_mentioned> have nearly all left
<location_mentioned>town</location_mentioned>. I have done, and have said, every thing which I could do, or say,
to pacify and inspire them with confidence—But they had seen the brilliant
equipment of <person_mentioned>Cos</person_mentioned>, his sword, and retinue; and they had listened to his 
flattering and captivating speeches; they had attended his parties, and tasted
his wine: But we have made no such display—we have no epaulettes, nor
swords—we have given no dinners, no parties—and as to wine, we have
none to use in the way he used it.</p>

<p>Immediately after the occupation of this <location_mentioned>fort </location_mentioned>by the <person_mentioned>force </person_mentioned>then 
commanded by <person_mentioned>Capt. Collinsworth</person_mentioned>, two <person_mentioned>Volunteers</person_mentioned>,<person_mentioned> John Williams</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>John
Tool</person_mentioned>, were dispatched to <location_mentioned>San Patricio</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>express</person_mentioned>, with letters to the <person_mentioned>Alcalde
of that jurisdiction</person_mentioned>, and to others, soliciting their cooperation. <person_mentioned>Tool </person_mentioned>and
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>were both surrendered to the <person_mentioned>military of Le Panticlan</person_mentioned>, put in
irons, and compelled to work on the <location_mentioned>Garrison</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>We are informed also, that, the population of <location_mentioned>San Patricio</location_mentioned>, have almost
unanimously joined the <person_mentioned>military</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The supplies spoken of above, will be forwarded to the <location_mentioned>Ranche of <person_mentioned>Don
Erasmo Seguin</person_mentioned></location_mentioned>, about <location_mentioned>10 leagues below Bexar</location_mentioned>, under the safe conduct of
<person_mentioned>Maj. George Southerland</person_mentioned>, with <person_mentioned>20 men</person_mentioned>. You can therefore, make such<barker_pb n="209"/>
arrangements for their transportation thence to <location_mentioned>Head Quarters</location_mentioned>, as you shall
deem most advisable. By <person_mentioned>Maj. Southerland</person_mentioned>, I will write you again.</p>

<p>It will be impossible for us to supply <person_mentioned>Don Juan Seguin</person_mentioned> with arms—We
could furnish powder, also small shot, which may be run into bullets—and
we can send him as much subsistence as he will probably need. <person_mentioned>Zentena</person_mentioned>
is at <location_mentioned>Le.Panteclan</location_mentioned>, and writes to me, that, he intends establishing the 
<location_mentioned>Custom House</location_mentioned> at that point. I doubt his fidelity.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] To <person_mentioned>Gen. Stephen F. Austin Com. in Chief of The Army of
the people.</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Head Quarters</location_mentioned></p>.
