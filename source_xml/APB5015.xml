<p>I have the Satisfaction to inform you that on the <date_mentioned n="10-28-1835">morning of the 28th
ultimo</date_mentioned>, there was an attack made by about <person_mentioned>300 Cavalry</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>100 infantry</person_mentioned>
of the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>, upon a <person_mentioned>Detachment of the Army</person_mentioned>, Commanded by <person_mentioned>Col. James
Bowie</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Capn Fanning</person_mentioned> near the <location_mentioned>Mission Concepcion</location_mentioned>, The <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>
brought on 2 pieces of Cannon for a vigorous assault.—They were received
in the best Manner—The battle lasted for some 2 or 3 hours and resulted
in the retreat of the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>with the loss as we have well ascertained of at
least <person_mentioned>50 Killed and wounded</person_mentioned>—and one piece of Cannon—Sixteen were left
<person_mentioned>dead <location_mentioned>on the field</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>2 wounded</person_mentioned>—the balance were Carried off—Our
men were posted <location_mentioned>along the bank of the river</location_mentioned> under good cover and 
sustained the loss of only one man. <person_mentioned>Richd Andrews of <location_mentioned>Mina</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> mortally wounded
and since dead—</p>

<p>In regard to future operations here, I am afraid they will be tedious and
prolonged, owing to the Strength of the <location_mentioned>fortifications </location_mentioned>of this place of
which we have Certain information—</p>

<p>Whether the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>Can be Kept together long enough to await the 
arrival of <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>and the necessary supply of heavy battering 
Cannon and Munitions I am sorry to say is somewhat uncertain— It has been<barker_pb n="233"/>
almost unanimously decided by a <person_mentioned>Council of the officers</person_mentioned> that the place is
too strong to be stormed by the Kind of force we have—There was from
this opinion but one dissenting voice—So you see our Condition—</p>

<p>There was a rumor which came from <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="11-01-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>that <person_mentioned>Savariego</person_mentioned>
had escaped from <location_mentioned>S Felipe</location_mentioned>—gone to the <location_mentioned>Nueces </location_mentioned>raised the <person_mentioned>Irish </person_mentioned>there and
joining them with the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>at that place had attacked <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>— But I
attach no credit to the report, as I know positively that he <person_mentioned>Savariego </person_mentioned>was in
<location_mentioned>S. Felipe</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-27-1835">a week ago</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
<p>P S My health has been very bad since I was at <location_mentioned>Cibolo </location_mentioned>and has not
improved—quite the reverse—I am much debilitated.</p>
