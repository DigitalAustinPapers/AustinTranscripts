<p>On your arrival in <location_mentioned>Washington City</location_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned> will, of course,
request an interview with <person_mentioned>President Jackson</person_mentioned>— I recommend that this 
request should be made in writing, and that the outlines of his object in
wishing the interview be stated—for example, after stating that he wishes
to pay his respects etc to the<person_mentioned> President of the <location_mentioned>U. S</</location_mentioned>person_mentioned> etc, etc, to go on and
say that, "being fully convinced by personal observation that the true
interests of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, of the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> and of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, require a termination of the
war between the latter and <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>on the basis of the separation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
from <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, either as an <location_mentioned>independent nation</location_mentioned> or its annexation to the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> he desires to have a conversation with <person_mentioned>Gen Jackson</person_mentioned> on that subject,
with the view of endeavoring to promote the general good of all 
concerned"— Or some thing to that amount, that will be confirmatory of
what he said to <person_mentioned>Jackson </person_mentioned>in his letter of <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th July last</date_mentioned>— think that this
course would open the way for a cordial reception, as it will be repeating
at <location_mentioned>Washington </location_mentioned>where he is free, what he said to <person_mentioned>Jackson </person_mentioned>from this place on
the <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4 July last</date_mentioned> when he was a <person_mentioned>prisoner</person_mentioned>—and thus afford the strongest 
evidence of his good faith—</p>

<p>I have inclosed to <person_mentioned>Mr Wharton </person_mentioned>copies of the public and private treaties
