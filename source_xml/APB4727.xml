John T. Mason and Jose Antonio Mexia. They represented the Galveston Bay
and Texas Land Company in Mexico, trying to induce the government to recognize
the company, which had taken over the empresario contracts of David G. Burnet,
Lorenzo de Zavala, and Joseph Vehlein.

<p><person_mentioned>S. M. Williams</person_mentioned></p>

<p>My good friend,</p>

<p>I confidently hoped to have met you at <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>by the <date_mentioned n="03-01-1835">1 of March</date_mentioned>, but
I find that I cannot— I think I shall be able to leave here in <date_mentioned n="03-01-1835">about 15<barker_pb n="43"/>
days,</date_mentioned> tho I cannot say to a certainty— I have some idea of employing
this interval in trying to get some aid of the <person_mentioned>Genl Govt</person_mentioned> towards opening
<location_mentioned>a road from Texas to the Paso del norte</location_mentioned>, or in a direct line (or as nearly
so as the country will admit) to <location_mentioned>Chihuahua </location_mentioned>I speak of this interprise in
my exposicion copies of which I have sent to <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>and by this mail
I send you one, I sent one to you <date_mentioned n="02-12-1835">two days ago </date_mentioned>directed to <location_mentioned>Austin</location_mentioned>— It
has been very well received here, and has satisfied every reasonable man—
I believe that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has more <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in the Govt and in <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>now, than
it ever had before. I can say the same as to myself—</p>

<p>I cannot believe that such men as <person_mentioned>Robertson </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Chambers </person_mentioned>can have
any influence at <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>and I confidently expect that the evil they have
done will be remedied— There was [never] a more outrageous injustice
done to anyone than that committed by <person_mentioned>Vidauri</person_mentioned> in renewing the contract
for the<location_mentioned> upper colony</location_mentioned> in direct violation of our rights— you must attend
to that business— I will be there as soon as I can to aid in putting things
to rights once more.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that <person_mentioned>Mason </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mexia </person_mentioned>tryed to do me all the
injury they could and to perpetuate my imprisonment as long as they
could— they never forgave me for opposing their schemes to make a
<location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and their monopolies of land etc and I shall be well
satisfied if they will remain my <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>for the balance of their lives—
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Tony </person_mentioned></hi>and them are birds of the same feather—</p>

<p>An effort was made in <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1835">Jany</date_mentioned>- to make a <location_mentioned>territory </location_mentioned>of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but it failed—
another effort was about to be made when my esposicion came out, which
has also died away.</p>

<p>The last clause of my esposicion was intended to kill this project, and
it has had the effect. A proposicion was made sometime since to renew
the 11 article of the law of <date_mentioned n="04-06-1830">6 april</date_mentioned> which I am told will die <hi rend="italic">en 
commission</hi>—so that upon the whole my personal sufferings will result to the
advantage of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, by removing prejudices and leading to inquiries that
have satisfied everyone— This is some consolation at least— It is in fact
a full reward for all my trouble and persecution.</p><barker_pb n="44"/>

<p>My <person_mentioned>constituents </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">ought </hi>to be satisfied with me— I have done my
duty towards them, regardless of my own personal interests or safety—
I have paid my own expenses and they have been very great indeed.</p>

<p>The <location_mentioned>Chihuahua road</location_mentioned> is a great hobby with me— I intend to persevere
untill it is completed, and <hi rend="italic">then </hi>I am done with empresas— I have written
to <location_mentioned>Chihuahua </location_mentioned>on the subject and think the whole influence of that state
can be inlisted in this great enterprise—it is the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>and <hi rend="italic">only </hi>object of my
ambition—</p>

<p>Cotton will be in great demand here <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1836">next year</date_mentioned>, it is so now—</p>

<p>I saw an ascension by <person_mentioned>Mr. Robertson</person_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="03-12-1835">12 instant</date_mentioned>—he descended
<location_mentioned>14 leagues South of this beyond the mountain [s] that surround the valley
of Mexico—</location_mentioned> he returned to day all well you will see it in <location_mentioned>papers</location_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>Grayson </person_mentioned>left last week for <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> via <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned>— I am going to
the <location_mentioned>Theatre </location_mentioned>so adios</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. A.</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I am told <person_mentioned>Aguirrie </person_mentioned>has sold those <location_mentioned>claims </location_mentioned>a second time and perhaps a
dozen times see to it before it is too late—</p>

<p>Write <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>that I am well— I am waiting for the Amnesty law, for I
am still on bail—</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <location_mentioned>(Coahuila y Texas)</location_mentioned> Al <person_mentioned>sor D. Samuel M. Williams
