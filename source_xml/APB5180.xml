<hi rend="italic">Memorandum Confidential Muskets.—</hi>

<p>There are 960, muskets in <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>: English, Tower proof—<hi rend="italic">oz bore</hi>:
a first rate article: which I can controul, if not sold, on receipt of orders,
given for their delivery, from this place, which can go in a moment, through
you, whenever an arrangement can be concluded as <hi rend="italic">follows</hi>:</p>

<p>960 Muskets______________________________________________________6$ short price is	$5760.—</p>

<p>1/3 for cash ___________________________________________________ $1920.—</p>

<p>1/3 3 mot Credit_________________________________________________ 1920</p>

<p>1/3 may be merged in the loan____________________________________ 1920	             5.760.—</p>

<p>Should any portion of these be sold on receipt of the order that may be
given, the balance, that are unsold (whatever be the number) may be 
delivered instanter. —What think you of this proposition ? ?— I doubt not
these 960 Muskets remain unsold yet, but this I cannot, of course vouch
for.—</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Again</hi>: There are 2000 Muskets <hi rend="italic">here </hi>of same description, good article
tower proof and ounce Ball or bore—The <person_mentioned>Holders </person_mentioned>ask for these $4.81 and
would amt to $9620— They will not sell them, Except for <hi rend="italic">part cash,</hi> and,
balance<hi rend="italic"> satisfactory short paper.</hi> They refused making any proposition
for the sale of them to you or your <person_mentioned>Govnt</person_mentioned>. as they are very cautious 
prudent folks, and know nothing of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>affairs. —Probably we can manage
it here, to make an arrangement, for them, and deliver, them, at <location_mentioned>N. 
Orleans</location_mentioned>, as soon as they can be sent there, at the same <hi rend="italic">price </hi>and <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>, as the
<hi rend="italic">960, first </hi>spoken of, on this paper—. This, I repeat I think we can
<hi rend="italic">manage</hi>, provided <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, the <person_mentioned>commissioners</person_mentioned>, think the good cause, will be
promoted thereby by <hi rend="italic">so doing</hi> — and you must understand; at same time,
that the small Gain, in the operation, is not a sufficient <hi rend="italic">object </hi>for us or any
one to Embark in this last arrangement, Unless you should consider it an
object to the <person_mentioned>Texian Governt</person_mentioned>. to send them on</p>

<p>They can be shippd <hi rend="italic">At once,</hi> and sent to <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned>, and if all is right,
go down to <location_mentioned>G. Bay</location_mentioned> at once—probably without discharging at all —The
same vessel that takes these <hi rend="italic">(if they go)</hi> can also take anything else you
may have to send down from here— tell me what you think of the matter
1st- as regards the 960—and then as regards the 2000 here —If we can get<barker_pb n="356"/>
the Loan up to 100.000 that will give us $10,000 Cash—and a portion of
this might perhaps be appropriated to the muskets.— <hi rend="italic">Now </hi>dont forget that
in connection with this and other <hi rend="italic">kindred topics</hi> of great interest to the
cause, you <hi rend="italic">must </hi>give us timely Notice, when you intend to leave 
<location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>—and you must let us know a week or at least 4 or five days before
Hand, so that <hi rend="italic">one </hi>of <hi rend="italic">us </hi>can go on and arrange all—</p>

<p>This I consider important in many points of view, as in 6 or less Hours
all can be done which would require days and sheets of paper and then 
perhaps not be as well understood.—So, <hi rend="italic">tell us</hi> or me, in answer to this and if
you can, by return post, how your time goes, and when you fix your 
departure in anticipation, and let us know, I will run on and see you, if 
possible and if not one of us <hi rend="italic">will </hi>go, and this will give us time to see what we
can do in the way of extending the Loan and also with subscription 
Donation lists etc.</p>

<p>Pardon my scrawl for I have been interrupted momently since I set down
at my desk— If <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1836">tomorrow</date_mentioned>s mail, or <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1836">tomorrow</date_mentioned>s steam boat confirms the
rumors (in <person_mentioned>Bryan</person_mentioned>'s Letter) that <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Sam </person_mentioned></hi>has whippd- the <person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mexicans</person_mentioned></person_mentioned>. It will of
course have a good effect on our collections and Subscriptions—</p>

<p>Excuse my lengthy communications for I have not had time to make
them <hi rend="italic">shorter</hi>— Very truly</p>

<p><person_mentioned>El mismo</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dont let these papers or my letters lay about or be exposed—</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Private Continued</hi></p>

<p>As regards the insurance there may be no claim on any one— If the
office Insured the property <hi rend="italic">against all risk— Including Capture</hi> by the
<person_mentioned>Enemy </person_mentioned>then there is no claim— If not against capture, but only against
sea Risk then the <person_mentioned>owners </person_mentioned>have no claim on the Insurance. —but <hi rend="italic">lose the</hi>
property, <hi rend="italic">without recourse</hi> to any one</p>

<p>I shall send you the <location_mentioned>Evening paper</location_mentioned> and C and <location_mentioned>Enquirer </location_mentioned>of this <date_mentioned n="05-xx-1836">morning</date_mentioned>.

came to hand this morning— Nothing direct from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, but some 
interesting advice from <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>, which ought to appear in <location_mentioned>the Globe</location_mentioned>—
<person_mentioned>Gorostizal </person_mentioned>is, in <location_mentioned>Phila</location_mentioned>. or will be today—He intends publishing in <location_mentioned>the Globe</location_mentioned>
or <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Nat Intel</location_mentioned></hi>, his full correspondence with this <person_mentioned>Govnt</person_mentioned>. also you will see
the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>s answer to the call of the <person_mentioned>House of Reps.</person_mentioned> which has not
reached us, —I call your attention to the enclosed paper in reference to
<person_mentioned>M</person_mentioned>—which you will please reply to, as soon as possible, and give me a
definite answer, as regards this transaction. Let it be a separate paper in
reply to mine, to show to the <person_mentioned>parties</person_mentioned>.— I have this morns. Letter from
<person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> at <location_mentioned>Phila</location_mentioned>. dated <date_mentioned n="05-14-1836">14th</date_mentioned> and note its contents. I hope to hear from<barker_pb n="357"/>
<person_mentioned>the <hi rend="italic">head </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">Committee </hi>at <location_mentioned>Phila</location_mentioned>.</person_mentioned> on the subject of the men, money,
wanted, to move them etc.— I was going to write him but shall wait, until
<date_mentioned n="05-xx-1836">tomorrow </date_mentioned>to receive his Letter We shall move in this business, without
doubt, and that promptly— See <person_mentioned>Stone</person_mentioned>s letter to you of yesterday addressd-
either at <location_mentioned>Baltimore </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>—I dont remember which—I agree with
you that the <location_mentioned>south </location_mentioned>will save you— Still, I am sorry nothing further has
been done here— that [than] when you left us— Tho I think something
further <hi rend="italic">will </hi>be done—today has been the first working day among us—and
I suppose all are at work but myself— I confess I have done nothing, and
the reason is before you—all calls on the subject of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>are made to
me—all <person_mentioned>enquirers </person_mentioned>sent to me—I have to get the news from the files of
papers <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, confer with <person_mentioned>Editors</person_mentioned>, and Talk up and answer inquiries etc. then
write you etc. etc. So that I trust you will find some excuse for me at
least for today— I do all I can and will do my utmost of this you must not
doubt. But I have to do all myself, none can act for me: or write for me—
This keeps me hard at work without fulfilling my promise of going on as I
intended today— Still will tomorrow— The Charleston Boat, tomorrow
might bring us news no doubt— I also send you a <location_mentioned>western paper</location_mentioned> just recd-—
it might contain something of interest: Yours etc</p>
