<p>I <person_mentioned>Elias R Wightman</person_mentioned> on my oath say and declare that I became 
acquainted with <person_mentioned>Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>James B Austin</person_mentioned> in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1825">1825 </date_mentioned>and that in
<date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1826">1826 </date_mentioned>I entered into a contract with <person_mentioned>Stephen F Austin</person_mentioned> to give him one
fourth of the <location_mentioned>matagorda Town League N° 11</location_mentioned> for and in consideration of
the like quantity of lands, else where</p>

<p>That in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1827">1827</date_mentioned> I obtained title to said <location_mentioned>league N° 11.</location_mentioned> When I requested
to know what lands the sd <person_mentioned>Austin </person_mentioned>would point out that we might lift our
bonds, and take title when he offered a <location_mentioned>fourth of the <person_mentioned>Crownover </person_mentioned>League
N° 6 west of Rio Colorado</location_mentioned>, for which he executed to me his bond for title,
and I made title to <person_mentioned>James B. Austin</person_mentioned> to one fourth of said <location_mentioned>L. N° 11.</location_mentioned> and
so it remained till <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1830">1830 </date_mentioned>(as I think) when in compliance with said bond
and other considerations, he agreed to give me <location_mentioned>one fourth of the <person_mentioned>James
Jones</person_mentioned> tract</location_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">number </hi>not recollected which he considered worth double the
<location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Crownover </person_mentioned>quarter</location_mentioned>, (as he said to me in a letter still in my possession) in
all this <person_mentioned>James B Austin</person_mentioned> was unknown in the stipulations and agreements
or in the consideration of the fourth of <location_mentioned>N° 11.</location_mentioned> L. other then receiving the
title that I recollect, and when in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1827">1827</date_mentioned> I <hi rend="italic">think </hi>we the <person_mentioned>proprietors </person_mentioned>met to
form regulations for the advancement of the projected Town of <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>,
out of compliment to <person_mentioned>James B Austin</person_mentioned> invited him to attend, He did so
and was one of the four <person_mentioned>signers </person_mentioned>of the first Constitution for the regulation
and transactions of the said Town, which Constitution is still in my 
possession with the signature of <person_mentioned>H. H. League</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Owner </person_mentioned>of one fourth <person_mentioned>James B.
Austin</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>owner </person_mentioned>of one fourth <person_mentioned>Duke </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Selkirk</person_mentioned>, by <person_mentioned>T. M. Duke</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>owners </person_mentioned>of
one fourth and <person_mentioned>E R Wightman</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>owner </person_mentioned>of one fourth, which was the 
principal act of ownership he ever exercised over it I wrote to him, at 
<location_mentioned>Brazoria </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned>once, in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1830">30</date_mentioned>—or <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1831">31 </date_mentioned>I <hi rend="italic">think </hi>on the subject of offering a
portion of it at sale in <location_mentioned>N. Orleans</location_mentioned> which he answered and much approved
but refered me however to <person_mentioned>Col Austin S. F.</person_mentioned> for his opinion as he said his
<person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>'s approval would be necessary, as he knew more about those
things or something to that amount (which letter I still have among my
papers) <person_mentioned>Col Austin</person_mentioned> discouraged for this time the project of the sale of
Town property saying it was too soon to push <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>He was doing
more for <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>than all we could do by premature sale He was
settling the country up the <location_mentioned>Colorado </location_mentioned>with <person_mentioned>Kentucs </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Tennesseans </person_mentioned>who
would, go down and make a frolic throwing the raft out etc. and I went
home and waited for the <person_mentioned>Kentuc </person_mentioned>frolic All other matters before and after
the demise of <person_mentioned>J. B. Austin</person_mentioned> <person_mentioned>Col S. F. Austin </person_mentioned>had the whole control of the
<location_mentioned>4th of Matagorda</location_mentioned>, and when the present Constitution was formed he acted
as the representative of <person_mentioned>J B. Austin</person_mentioned> at the same time avering that He was
the true and real <person_mentioned>owner </person_mentioned>which in due time he would show, and made such
declaration a matter of record in the <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Alcalde</person_mentioned>s office in the Town of San<barker_pb n="480"/>
filipe de Austin</location_mentioned>, since which time and before I have many letters in which
he exercised ownership over it and finally at <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> in <date_mentioned n="xx-xx-1835">1835</date_mentioned>—he did
the same when I saw him in <date_mentioned n="12-xx-1835">Dec of same year</date_mentioned>, and was recognized by the
<person_mentioned>board of proprietors</person_mentioned>, Yet nominally as the representative of his Brother
<person_mentioned>James B. Austin</person_mentioned> Through my <hi rend="italic">agency </hi>which was constituted at the framing
of the Instrument called the Constitution of the <person_mentioned>Board of proprietors</person_mentioned>, and
never revoked while he lived</p>

<p>As to the question of the lands deeded to <person_mentioned>James B Austin</person_mentioned> I cannot say
on what tenure he so secured them only from common report But I know
that <hi rend="italic">titles </hi>were made to him of which he knew nothing untill explained to
him as was the case of the <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>fourth interest</p>
