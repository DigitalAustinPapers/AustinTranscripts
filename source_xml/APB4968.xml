<p><person_mentioned>Gen S. F. Austin</person_mentioned>,</p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>Since sealing my official of <date_mentioned n="10-19-1835">last evening</date_mentioned> and 5 o.c. <date_mentioned n="10-20-1835">this morning</date_mentioned>, a 
<person_mentioned>Deserter from <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has been introduced to my <location_mentioned>quarters </location_mentioned>who says he lives<barker_pb n="195"/>
in <location_mentioned>Monterey</location_mentioned>—that, he deserted <date_mentioned n="10-11-1835">8 days ago</date_mentioned>, intending to return <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>—
that, after leaving <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, he heard of the fall of <location_mentioned>Goliad</location_mentioned>, and turned his
course for this place. He states, that, all the <person_mentioned><location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>Troopes</person_mentioned> will join the
<person_mentioned>Americans</person_mentioned>, as soon as they present themselves; that, the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned></hi>and 
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>infantry </person_mentioned></hi>want a <hi rend="italic">fight</hi>, but that the <person_mentioned>cavalry </person_mentioned>do not—that, when the <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>were
sent to <location_mentioned>Gonzales </location_mentioned>after the Cannon, they were paid only S3 ea. and drew
only a little corn.</p>

<p>He says there are <person_mentioned>300 infantry </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>400 cavalry </person_mentioned>there—one half of the
<person_mentioned>former convicts</person_mentioned>—that, <person_mentioned>Gen Cos</person_mentioned> was making no preparation whatever, for
defence, in the way of fortifying—that, there were 2 pieces of cannon on
the <location_mentioned>western side of Town, <hi rend="italic">near </hi>the Church</location_mentioned>; and 2 in the <location_mentioned>Alimo</location_mentioned>. <location_mentioned>In the
Town</location_mentioned>, his <person_mentioned>patrol </person_mentioned>is strong, <hi rend="italic">especially at night</hi>, both in <person_mentioned>cavalry</person_mentioned>, and 
<person_mentioned>infantry</person_mentioned>—that he keeps <person_mentioned>60 sentinels </person_mentioned>out during the night; besides <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">four </hi>
cavalry scouts</person_mentioned>, of <person_mentioned>20 men</person_mentioned> each; that, there is great discontent among the 
<person_mentioned>inhabitants</person_mentioned>, who will almost unanimously join the <person_mentioned>Colonists</person_mentioned>, as soon as they
enter the place; that, <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Ugartechea </person_mentioned></hi>and <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Candela</person_mentioned></hi>, are the only <person_mentioned>Officers</person_mentioned>, 
remarkable for their antipathy against us— and <hi rend="italic">these</hi>, do every thing in their
power to stimulate the men to defend the place to the last extremity.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Bracken</person_mentioned>, arrived here <date_mentioned n="10-19-1835">last evening</date_mentioned> from <location_mentioned>Zacatacas</location_mentioned>; who left there a
short time since; he says, that, a few days before he left that <location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned>, all the
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>except <person_mentioned>400</person_mentioned>, had been marched to <location_mentioned>Guadalajara</location_mentioned>, to oppose <person_mentioned>Alvarez</person_mentioned>,
who had won two important victories over <person_mentioned>Santanna's troops</person_mentioned>. That 4
<person_mentioned>Generals</person_mentioned>, amongst whom are, <person_mentioned>Montenegro </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Guzman</person_mentioned>, had joined 
<person_mentioned>Alvarez </person_mentioned>and that he was daily acquiring strength; and further, that the
<person_mentioned>troops at <location_mentioned>Saltillo </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>San Louis</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, destined for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, had been ordered
back, after having taken up the line of march.</p>

<p><date_mentioned n="10-20-1835">9. o. c. same day</date_mentioned>—<person_mentioned>Col. Powers</person_mentioned> this moment arrived from the 
neighbourhood of <location_mentioned>San Patricio</location_mentioned>; He states that the cannon there had been 
removed to the <location_mentioned>garrison of Le Panticlan</location_mentioned>, and that the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>there, were 
fortifying day and night. A <person_mentioned>courier </person_mentioned>had arrived there, who gave information
of the near approach of <person_mentioned>200 Cavalry </person_mentioned>from <location_mentioned>Aquaverda </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Loredo</location_mentioned>, to the
<person_mentioned>garrison on the <location_mentioned>Nueces</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>; and that there were also from 2 to 300 more on the
march <location_mentioned>from Matamoros to the Nueces</location_mentioned>; intended for the recapture of this
<location_mentioned>post</location_mentioned>. This information comes through an <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>sent to the <person_mentioned>comt. of the
<location_mentioned>Loredo </location_mentioned>troops</person_mentioned>; who accidentally passed them, and reached the <location_mentioned>Nueces</location_mentioned>
without seeing them.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col. Powers</person_mentioned> further states that, <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>complains in a letter to the <person_mentioned>Com'g
officer at <location_mentioned>Le Panticlan</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, that his <person_mentioned>whole force</person_mentioned>, including those on the way, is
only 1700. This <person_mentioned>Garrison </person_mentioned>has a <person_mentioned>Piquet of 15 or 20 men</person_mentioned>, <location_mentioned>6 Leagues this
side Sn Patricio</location_mentioned>; and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, about the same distance the other side, for 
forwarding <person_mentioned>expresses</person_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="196"/>

<p>From all this, you can easily judge whether this place ought to be
evacuated, and whether <person_mentioned>50 men </person_mentioned>can make a successful defence.</p>
