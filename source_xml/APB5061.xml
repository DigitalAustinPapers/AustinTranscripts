<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Father </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mother</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>and myself arrived here <date_mentioned n="11-29-1835">last night</date_mentioned> from the <location_mentioned>camp </location_mentioned>in good health—
<person_mentioned>Uncle </person_mentioned>resigned his office on the <date_mentioned n="10-24-1835">24 ult.</date_mentioned> and we left the <date_mentioned n="10-25-1835">next day</date_mentioned> for this
place— I think he will go on to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> soon, perhaps in a few
days as he was called by the <person_mentioned>Convention </person_mentioned>to go as a <person_mentioned>commissioner </person_mentioned>to the
<location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> but with what power I know not; if he is not vested with the power of
attaching <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>U. S</location_mentioned>. but only to borrow money etc I think he
wont go</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Burleson </person_mentioned>was elected <person_mentioned>commander in Chief</person_mentioned> to fill <person_mentioned>Uncle</person_mentioned>s place. There
are 4 or <person_mentioned>500 men</person_mentioned> in <location_mentioned>camp </location_mentioned>who are determined to stick to it until <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>
falls or they eat up all, every thing in that <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>. A Maile was 
intersepted the day before we left by which we learned that there was an order
for raising <person_mentioned>10.000 Soldiers</person_mentioned> to come on to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>as soon, as possible under
the Command of <person_mentioned>Genl. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> himself perhaps they will be here
next <date_mentioned n="Spring-1836">Spring</date_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="269"/>

<p>I left <person_mentioned>Joel </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Camp </location_mentioned>in good health and determined to see the last of
the war</p>

<p>There was considerable confusion and dissatisfaction in the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>on
account of the acts of the <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>and I find they have not pleased the
<person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>generally</p>

<p>I will write you again Soon</p>

<p><person_mentioned>M. A. Bryan</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>
