<p>This is my birth day—my health is much improved tho still bad and I
am still tormented with dispepsia, a most cursed disease, for body and
mind— the public matters are getting on well—the state of things, which
I have long labored to bring about is gradually coming round, which is
union and the disappearance of those old parties and nonsense which in
times past have distracted and almost ruined this <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— I believe that
I have contributed something towards bringing about this state [of] things
—tho at the loss perhaps of some [men who] <hi rend="italic">called </hi>themselves <hi rend="italic">old <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned></hi>
I a[m as rapidly as?] I can, gradually preparing [to relieve?] myself in
toto from all kinds [of public business?] and shall do so permanently as
soon gs I can—</p>

<p>Come <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and lay [aside] your wild mode of talking about
the peo[ple] and everything else—it is time for you to stop all that kind of
wildness both in talking, acts and business—harm enough has been done
already by it—do no more— you have greatly vexed and worried and
distressed me. So much so that my brain has been greatly fevered. I am
in a considerable degree getting over it— It is no easy matter to admit
anything like <hi rend="italic">permanent estrangement</hi> from a person who has been united
to us by close friendship for years and in times of trouble— you have
done wrong and have greatly injured, your <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, yourself, and your 
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>—but that is past—let it be a lesson to you for the future— Come
<location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>—the land affairs are to be closed and reported to <person_mentioned>congress </person_mentioned>by <date_mentioned n="12-01-1836">1 of
December</date_mentioned>—I wish to get rid of it all as soon as possible and wash my hands
of it all forever.</p>

<p>As to yourself—let politics and the public affairs alone—arrange your
past business—get a standing with the <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>cotton planters</person_mentioned></hi>, and confine your-<barker_pb n="447"/>
self exclusively to commercial business—the purchase of cotton and sale
of goods will present a vast field to a regular <person_mentioned>merchant </person_mentioned>who has no other
"irons in the fire"—but the old <person_mentioned>farmers </person_mentioned>are suspicious and watchfull—
they like [a] safe <person_mentioned>merchant</person_mentioned>, and not one who does [bus]iness on a dashing
or gambling scale, [I repeat the remar?]ks in substance I made to you in
a letter from [Mexico when I first?] heard you were going into the 
[mercantile?] business, and had you been governed [by th]em more closely
than you have been you [w]ould have saved much loss and difficulty and
injury and mortification to your <person_mentioned>friends</person_mentioned>, and to me in particular— That
cursed <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>trip of yours has indeed been a <hi rend="italic">curse </hi>to you and to me
and to the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and to everybody else. I am trying to banish even the
recollection of it from my mind, and when I fully recover my health, hope
shall be able to do so.— In future I never mean to speak of it or allude
to it, if I can avoid it— I have cursed it in so many forms and shapes
that my anger is becoming almost exhausted and will, I sincerely hope,
finally wear away, <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>you have wounded me very deeply, but you
are so deeply rooted in my affections, that with all your faults, you are at
heart too much like a wild and heedless brother to be entirely banished—-
Come <person_mentioned>home</person_mentioned>	Your old friend</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] Mr. <person_mentioned>Sam M. Williams</person_mentioned> Cou of <person_mentioned>H. H Williams</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Baltimore</location_mentioned></p>
