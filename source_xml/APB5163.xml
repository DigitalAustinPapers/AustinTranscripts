<p><person_mentioned>Mr William Bryan</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>Yours of the <date_mentioned n="04-10-1836">10th Instant</date_mentioned> is this moment received: desolation it seems is
sweeping over <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— My heart and soul are sick but my spirit is 
unbroken— I foresaw the evils of War and have (as is well known) tried to
keep them out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—but it was impossible— <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> has raised
the bloody flag of a <person_mentioned>Pirate</person_mentioned>—the fate of <person_mentioned>Pirates </person_mentioned>will sooner or later be his
fate, but enough of this, the object of this is, to thank you, you and <hi rend="italic">you
alone</hi> have written to us, from the <person_mentioned>Govt. of Texas</person_mentioned> we have not rec'd <hi rend="italic">one
word</hi>, not even <hi rend="italic">one</hi>.</p>

<p>I thank you for your last letter, although it comes to us as the messenger
of desolation and death, Justice will yet be done to you—<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will rise
again and your services will then be remembered.</p><barker_pb n="341"/>

<p>We shall get some money here I think— I shall go immediately to the
<location_mentioned>Western country</location_mentioned></p>
