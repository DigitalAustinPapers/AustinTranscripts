<p>This will be handed to you by my Friend <person_mentioned>Doctor Robert Andrews</person_mentioned>,
with whom I have made an arrangement (subject to your 
confirmation), which I think will be for the mutual advantage of us all.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Doctr. Andrews</person_mentioned> had it [in] contemplation to locate a place with in
four miles of our <location_mentioned>Ouchitaw </location_mentioned>location on the <location_mentioned>Caddo River</location_mentioned> where he 
intended to lay off <hi rend="italic">a Town</hi>, but declined it after we made ours altho he
thinks that a Town might be layed off there to advantage,—a Town
there would certainly interfere some with ours—I have therefore
agreed to let him become interested in our <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Ouchitaw </hi></location_mentioned>location <hi rend="italic">one
Eighth </hi>by his paying that porportion of the cost of the claim in twelve
months— and also in consideration of his agreeing to go immediately
down to that country (with authority from <person_mentioned>Genl Rector</person_mentioned> to survey
the claims if he will give it) and to survey all our locations, lay off the
Town at the <location_mentioned>Little Rock</location_mentioned>, at the <person_mentioned>Ouchitaw </person_mentioned>and on <person_mentioned>Red River</person_mentioned></p>

<p>he is fully competent to this business and it will be some object for
us to have our Towns in Market <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>—the contract I have
made is to let him be interested one Eighth in our <location_mentioned>Ouchitaw </location_mentioned>location
as above stated—give him two lots if he draws, or one if he chooses it,
in the <location_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Little Rock</hi> Town</location_mentioned>— this contract however is subject to your
sanction, or rejection, as I think if he becomes interested, we aught
<hi rend="italic">both </hi>to relinquish a part as it will be for our joint benefit—if you
approve of the arrangement therefor you can take his note for the
Money and give <hi rend="italic">a Bond</hi> in our joint names, for the <hi rend="italic">title</hi>.</p>

<p>Make every exertion to get an order of survey and to get <person_mentioned>Andrews</person_mentioned>
appointed the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">Surveyor</hi></person_mentioned>—but do not let it be known that he is 
interested in the location,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
