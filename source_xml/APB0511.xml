<p><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-22-1822">May 22 1822</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I have been here since the <date_mentioned n="04-29-1822">29th of April</date_mentioned> but my business is not yet
finished, it is before <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>and I am told will soon be dispatched—
Some great events have transpired since my arrival here, and this
great city is now in a State of Commotion and rejoicing— on the
<date_mentioned n="05-17-1822">17</date_mentioned> the <person_mentioned>Generalissimo Iturbide</person_mentioned> resigned, and sent his resignation
to <person_mentioned>Congress</person_mentioned>, this produced much sensation, which broke out on the<barker_pb n="518"/>
night of the <date_mentioned n="05-18-1822">18</date_mentioned>, by firing of Musketry and cannon in the air loaded
with Balls, and loud Shouts from the <person_mentioned>Soldiers </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Citizens </person_mentioned>
proclaiming <person_mentioned>Iturbide </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Emperor </person_mentioned>under the title of <person_mentioned>Augustin 1st</person_mentioned>— the
next day the <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>met at 7 and at 12 elected <person_mentioned>Iturbide Emperor</person_mentioned>,
this was <date_mentioned n="05-19-1822">Sunday</date_mentioned>, on <date_mentioned n="05-20-1822">Monday </date_mentioned>the form of the oath was agreed on
and on <date_mentioned n="05-21-1822">Tuesday </date_mentioned>which was yesterday it was administered in 
<location_mentioned>Congress Hall</location_mentioned> by the <person_mentioned>President </person_mentioned>amidst the Shouts of the Multitude,
this day has been a constant scene of rejoicing, the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>paraded
and the Bells have kept a constant roar since daylight— I hope
this event will be a fortunate one for the Country, the <person_mentioned>Emperor </person_mentioned>I 
believe is a very good man as well as a great one, and has the happiness
of the <location_mentioned>nation </location_mentioned>much at heart— I shall return as soon as I can, but
it is uncertain when that will be, everything is now at a stand, my
prospect[s] are very good and I think everything will be right—
you must keep closely to your studies and learn the language as
soon as possible— Should you hear anything of the vessel <person_mentioned>Mr
Little</person_mentioned> has charge of the cargo and you must aid him to sell the
articles for cash or mules— the Trunks keep safe until I arrive,
there are some things in one of them for the <person_mentioned>Govr </person_mentioned>and his <person_mentioned>Lady</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I was so unfortunate as not to see the <person_mentioned>Baron [de Bastrop]</person_mentioned>, he left
here early in the morning after I arrived I called at his lodgings not
more than half an hour after he had started give my respects to
him— You must conduct yourself very <hi rend="italic">prudently </hi>and attend to
your studies and to <hi rend="italic">Religion </hi>(sic), there are some dark clouds
hanging over this part of the <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, many are dissatisfied and
disappointed at the election of <person_mentioned>Iturbide</person_mentioned>, and the <person_mentioned>Republican party</person_mentioned>
is still restless tho I hope there will be no difficulty, but I fear it
much, I have wrote you since I arrived here and given some account
of this <location_mentioned>city</location_mentioned>— it is truly a large and splendid place, Something
larger than <location_mentioned>N. York</location_mentioned> and more splendidly built— but the people
are greatly behind the <location_mentioned>U. S</location_mentioned> in everything—</p>

<p>farewell I wrote to <person_mentioned>Bryan </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Mother </person_mentioned>from here by a Gentleman
going to <location_mentioned>Philadelphia</location_mentioned>—</p>
