<p>Dear <person_mentioned>Genl</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I write merely to say that the <person_mentioned>Acting President of the Govt, of <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>,
Jose Justo Carro</person_mentioned>, has determined to disregard the Armistice agreed upon
between <person_mentioned>Genl Houston</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>St Anna</person_mentioned>, and he has issued his proclamation
declaring his intention to prosecute the War against <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>immediately.
Our <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, it seems by this publication, (which has been republished in
the <location_mentioned>Bulletin of this City</location_mentioned>), is to be invaded by <person_mentioned>seventeen thousand Men</person_mentioned>. The
prevailing opinion here is that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>should loose no time in Making ample
preparation to repel the expected invasion: And acting under this 
impression the <person_mentioned>Citizens of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who are here have joined in a recommendation
to <person_mentioned>Genl Hunt</person_mentioned> to proceed immediately with his preparations to raise and
organize his <person_mentioned>Division</person_mentioned>, as you May see by the enclosed Copy. A report
reached here today from <location_mentioned>Vera Cruz</location_mentioned> that the <person_mentioned>Govt </person_mentioned>was not able to raise the
men and Money to Carry on another Campaign against us. I did not learn
from what authority this report emanated, but it is only necessary for us
to reflect how wofully the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have been lead astray by such
idle remours to lead us at once to the conclusion that now is the time to
prepare for action.</p><barker_pb n="370"/>

<p>I leave <date_mentioned n="06-24-1836">in the morning</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Mobile</location_mentioned>, thence to <location_mentioned>Claiborne</location_mentioned>, from whence I
shall return with all possible despatch. Please Write Me to <location_mentioned>San Augustine</location_mentioned>
immediately upon the receipt of this, and if in your opinion the return of
the Archives had better be delayed I will act upon your advice.</p>

<p>I am much indisposed therefore Must Make My letter Short</p>
