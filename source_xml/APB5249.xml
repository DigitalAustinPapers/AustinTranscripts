<p>Dear Sir—</p>

<p>I have been nominated by many persons, whose opinions I am bound to
respect, as a <person_mentioned>candidate </person_mentioned>for the office of <person_mentioned>President of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, at the <date_mentioned n="09-xx-1836">September</date_mentioned>
elections.</p>

<p>Influenced by the governing principle which has regulated my actions
since I came to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, fifteen years ago, which is to serve the <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>in
any capacity in which the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>might think proper to employ me, I shall<barker_pb n="412"/>
not decline the highly responsible and difficult one now proposed, should
the majority of my <person_mentioned>fellow citizens</person_mentioned> elect me.</p>

<p>My labors and exertions to settle this <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>and promote its welfare
are well known. My object has been the general good, and the permanent
liberty and prosperity of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. In the pursuit of this object I can say
with a clear conscience that I have been honest and sincere in my 
intentions, and shall continue to be so, whether I am acting as a private <person_mentioned>citizen</person_mentioned>
or as a <person_mentioned>public officer</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I perceive by the proclamation of the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>, ordering the election,
that the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>are requested to say whether they are in favor or not of
annexing <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>. On this point I shall consider myself
bound, if elected, to obey the will of the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>. As a <person_mentioned>citizen</person_mentioned>, however, I
am free to say that I am in favor of annexation, and will do all in my
power to effect it with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>Respectfully your fellow citizen	<person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>
