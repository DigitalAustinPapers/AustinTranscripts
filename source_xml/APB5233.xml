<p>Dear Sir;</p>

<p>from the political news contained in the enclosed of same date and other
circumstances I do not verily believe that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will be again invaded.</p>

<p>Should future Legislation rob me of the <location_mentioned>lands </location_mentioned>I have acquired under the
laws existing at the date of my purchase, at the Sacrifice of my <location_mentioned>Cotton 
factory</location_mentioned> mortgaged, and compromising my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>for their endorsements to a
heavy amount, I will be ruined like many others have been in this Wicked
world by <hi rend="italic">Might </hi>not <hi rend="italic">right</hi>.</p>

<p>In case this Should happen, can I count of You for eleven leagues in the
rolling <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>near to those I now own at fifty cents p. acre payable in
one and two Years from date of possession. I do not mean on the very
<location_mentioned>frontier Settlements</location_mentioned> but Some Where in the Vicinity of the <location_mentioned>Navto</location_mentioned>. or <location_mentioned>San
Felipe</location_mentioned>. If You answer me in the affirmative I wish to proceed immediately
with the following project, provided you can also immediately forward me
a passport or leave of absence for twelve instead of Six Months.</p>

<p>The information I have acquired from books and fully corroborated by
Several conversations with various persons I have given to a <person_mentioned>french friend</person_mentioned>
a <person_mentioned>gentleman perfectly conversant with the culture of the vines</person_mentioned>, and I wish
to accompany him to <location_mentioned>France </location_mentioned>to bring—out in <date_mentioned n="03-xx-1837">march </date_mentioned>or <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1837">april next</date_mentioned> 50 or <person_mentioned>100
Laborers</person_mentioned> and make an experiment Which if successful will pave the way
for many future benefits for <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and for those concerned.</p>

<p>I pray You answer me immediately and if favorable Send also the 
passport. We wish to leave <location_mentioned>New-York</location_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="09-01-1836">first September next</date_mentioned> in order to
have time -to make a good Selection; which whilst my <person_mentioned>companion </person_mentioned>is doing I
will visit <location_mentioned>England </location_mentioned>and carry letters to the <person_mentioned>rich people</person_mentioned> there and, if You
wish, try to induce them to Send with me to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>an <person_mentioned>agent </person_mentioned>authorised to
make a heavy loan which either to the <location_mentioned>Republic </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>State of Texas</location_mentioned> ought to
be of great advantage.</p>

<p>Please make time to answer this forthwith directed to <person_mentioned>Geo. L. Hammeken</person_mentioned>
<location_mentioned>New-York</location_mentioned>, and if my friend <person_mentioned>Guy </person_mentioned>will make a duplicate, Send it also to</p>
