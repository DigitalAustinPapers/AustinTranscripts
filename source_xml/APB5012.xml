<p><location_mentioned>Head Quarters above Bexar</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="11-02-1835">Nov., 2 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>To <person_mentioned>Colo. Bowie</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Capt. Fanning</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I enclose you the result of a <person_mentioned>council of War</person_mentioned> held <date_mentioned n="11-02-1835">this morning</date_mentioned> by the
<person_mentioned>officers of this division</person_mentioned>—you will see that the <person_mentioned>Council </person_mentioned>has decided it is
inexpedient to attempt to take <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>by storm at present—that the <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>
should take such a position as will enable it to harrass the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>as much
as possible, out of reach of Cannon until the 18 pound battering pieces and
additional <person_mentioned>reinforcements </person_mentioned>arrive— This decision is submitted to the 
consideration of the <person_mentioned>officers of your division</person_mentioned>.</p><barker_pb n="230"/>

<p>In addition I will add several suggestions that were made— One is to
occupy the <location_mentioned>Mill </location_mentioned>by <person_mentioned>200 men</person_mentioned> and post the balance <location_mentioned>on the river</location_mentioned> under cover
of a <location_mentioned>bank </location_mentioned>above and continue the <person_mentioned>battallion </person_mentioned>below in the position it now
occupies— To this it is objected, that our force is not sufficient to invest
the <location_mentioned>town</location_mentioned>, so as to prevent supplies from entering and that no important
object can be effected in that way, that more can be done by uniting the
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>whole force</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>above town</location_mentioned></hi> and sending out parties of <person_mentioned>50 men</person_mentioned>, every day and
night to range around, drive off cattle etc. As to corn it is certain they
have a large supply inside— This point is therefore also submitted to your
consideration, whether or not the <person_mentioned>whole force</person_mentioned> ought to be united <location_mentioned>above
town</location_mentioned> where corn is plenty and harass the <person_mentioned>enemy </person_mentioned>by keeping out beeves by
means of <person_mentioned>detachments </person_mentioned>and wait until the battering cannon and <person_mentioned>reenforcements </person_mentioned>
arrive or whether the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>should remain divided as it now is.</p>

<p>To decide this point, the only question is this; can the <person_mentioned>present force </person_mentioned>
invest <location_mentioned>Bexar </location_mentioned>all around? if it can not, how can beeves be prevented from
going in, except by keeping <person_mentioned>detachments </person_mentioned>constantly out? Can these 
<person_mentioned>Detachments </person_mentioned>be sent and kept out, at all, while the <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>is divided?</p>

<p>I will now make a suggestion of my own for your consideration— It is
this— you will take a safe position <location_mentioned>below</location_mentioned>— I will do the same <location_mentioned>above each
<person_mentioned>division</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> will be subdivided into <person_mentioned>parties of 20 or 25 men</person_mentioned>—one of these
<person_mentioned>parties </person_mentioned>will leave the <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>upper division</person_mentioned></location_mentioned> at day light and range around on the
<location_mentioned>west </location_mentioned>and sleep with you at night—a similar <person_mentioned>party </person_mentioned>will start from your 
division at the same time from the <location_mentioned>mouth of Salado</location_mentioned> and the <location_mentioned>missions up the
Salado</location_mentioned> and sleep here at night—a similar <person_mentioned>detachment </person_mentioned>will start at night
from each <location_mentioned>camp </location_mentioned>and range around in the same way until they make the
circle and get back to their respective divisions— I prefer this 
arrangement to the other.</p>

<p>I shall await your answer before I come to a final conclusion.
I shall dispatch a <person_mentioned>confidential man</person_mentioned> back to bring out the 18 pound
cannon and Shot, and also send <person_mentioned>Farmer </person_mentioned>to <location_mentioned>Gonzales </location_mentioned>to make round ball—
but shall not do it untill I receive an answer from you to this 
communication— I therefore wish you to give me an answer as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Should you be decidedly of opinion that the <person_mentioned>whole force</person_mentioned> should be united
—you can act on that decision at once, without any further order from
me— Should you prefer remaining, do so, and give your opinions as to the
best way of keeping out beeves—</p>
