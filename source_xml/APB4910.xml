<p><location_mentioned>Committee room of the <person_mentioned>Committee
of safety of the jurisdiction of Austin</person_mentioned></location_mentioned></p>
<p><person_mentioned>San Felipe de Austin</person_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="10-04-1835">Oct. 4, 1835</date_mentioned></p>
<p>War is declared against military despotism— Public opinion has 
proclaimed it with one united voice— The campaign has opened. The 
<person_mentioned>military at <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> have advanced upon <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>General Cos</person_mentioned> has arrived and
threatens to overrun the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>But one spirit, one common purpose, animates <person_mentioned>every one in this 
department</person_mentioned>, which is to take <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, and drive all the <person_mentioned>military </person_mentioned>out of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, 
before the campaign closes.</p>

<p>There are about <person_mentioned>three hundred volunteers at <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> at this time, and
will be upwards of five hundred in a few days.</p>

<p>It is confidently believed <location_mentioned>in this quarter</location_mentioned> that the <person_mentioned>people of the 
<location_mentioned>department of Nacogdoches</</location_mentioned>person_mentioned> will turn out and join the <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">army of the people</hi></person_mentioned> now in
the <location_mentioned>field </location_mentioned>and facing the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Arms and ammunition are needed; we have more <person_mentioned>men </person_mentioned>than guns. Could
not some muskets be procured from the<location_mentioned> other side of the Sabine</location_mentioned>? This
<person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>will contribute, and is responsible that the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>here will do
the same, to pay a full proportion of the expense. This is all important—<barker_pb n="158"/>
a few wagon loads of muskets and fixed ammunition would be of the 
utmost service at this time. Could not <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>also be had from the
<location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned>? Our cause is one that merits the moral and physical aid of
a <person_mentioned>free and magnanimous people</person_mentioned>, and those who now step forward, may
confidently expect that <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>will reward their services.</p>

<p>That distinguishd and virtuous patriot <person_mentioned>Don Lorenzo de Zavala</person_mentioned> formerly
<person_mentioned>governor of the State of Mexico</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>late minister to France</person_mentioned> has just 
arrived from his <location_mentioned>residence on San Jacinto</location_mentioned>, and is now here at the <location_mentioned>residence of
the chairman of the committee</location_mentioned>. He is a citizens of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and enters fully
and warmly in the cause of the <person_mentioned>people</person_mentioned>, approves very much of the position
they have taken against military despotism, and of the <location_mentioned>circular </location_mentioned>of this
<person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>of the <date_mentioned n="09-19-1835">19th ult</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>This <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>relys on you to forward copies of this communication
to <location_mentioned>San Augustin</location_mentioned> and the other <person_mentioned>committees in<location_mentioned> that quarter</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and also to send
the inclosed papers to <person_mentioned>some parties in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> (<location_mentioned>circulars </location_mentioned>of this 
<person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>of the <date_mentioned n="09-19-1835">19th ult</date_mentioned>. and <date_mentioned n="10-03-1835">3 October</date_mentioned> and public proceedings of other 
<person_mentioned>committees</person_mentioned>), for publication, in order that the <person_mentioned>public </person_mentioned>may be generally 
informed of the present state of affairs in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>An <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>has been sent to <location_mentioned>San Jacinto</location_mentioned> and <location_mentioned>Trinity</location_mentioned>, it would however
be important for that <person_mentioned>committee </person_mentioned>to communicate with the <person_mentioned>people of <location_mentioned>Trinity</location_mentioned>
and <location_mentioned>Bevils Settlement</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, as it inspires confidence to know that the <location_mentioned>whole
country</location_mentioned> is acting in union and with one and the same spirit and one 
purpose— This, as I before observed, is to take <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned>, and drive the <person_mentioned>military</person_mentioned>
out of <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>before the campaign closes.</p>
