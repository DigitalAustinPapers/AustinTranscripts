<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>I am still here, a <person_mentioned>prisoner on bail</person_mentioned>— nothing has taken place in my 
situation since the <date_mentioned n="12-25-1834">25 day of December</date_mentioned>, when I was released from <location_mentioned>close 
confinement</location_mentioned> on bail—</p>

<p>I make no calculations when I shall leave or whether I shall return by
land or water—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>legislature at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> has involved matters in a beautiful tangle
by the cursed law authorizing the <person_mentioned>Govr</person_mentioned>- to dispose of <location_mentioned>400 leagues of land
</location_mentioned>as he pleases. I fear this law will [ere] ate much more discontent in
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>[tha]n anything which has happened— nothing could have been
more imprudent— It will produce restrictions and in short everything bad
that can be imagined—</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>senator of that State</person_mentioned> is a faithful defender of his state and a firm
one, but all he gains or can gain by trying to defend such a measure as
this, is to ruin himself in public opinion here and loose all influence</p><barker_pb n="63"/>

<p>I hope they have had sense enough at <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>to take no part in the
civil war that seems to be commencing— Keep out of such things— If
<person_mentioned>Durste </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Carbajal </person_mentioned>voted for the 400 league law—tell them to remember
<hi rend="italic">what kind of constituents</hi> they have and to be more cautious in future,—
That law will cause discontent in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Genl Santana</person_mentioned> leaves <date_mentioned n="04-18-1835">in three days</date_mentioned> for the <location_mentioned>interior </location_mentioned><location_mentioned>(Zacatecas)</location_mentioned> he 
informed me <date_mentioned n="04-14-1835">yesterday </date_mentioned>that he should visit <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and take me with him,
after these other matters are settled— He is very friendly to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>and it
would be an advantage to that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>if he would pay it a visit</p>

<p>I do not write home by this mail, so you can send this to them, and say
that I beg of them all to have nothing to do with the politics of this
<location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>—I mean the present civil dissentions—a dead silence a dead calm
as to these family quarrels is the only proper course for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I know nothing of what is going on at <location_mentioned>Monclova</location_mentioned>, nor of your opinions
about these matters—but feel confident they are similar to mine— I am
decidedly of the opinion that the federal system is in no danger at present—
There will be some change, but not a radical one— This is my opinion</p>
