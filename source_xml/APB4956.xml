<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The <person_mentioned>bearer Erasmus Smith</person_mentioned> is well known to you—I have conversed
with him and learn that the <person_mentioned>cavalry of <location_mentioned>San Antonio</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> are disaffected to the
cause with which they are serving. He thinks he can render Service to us
in a certain way—Do consider if some thing cannot be done by assurances
to the disaffected through this channel.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>C. B. Stewart</person_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Col S F Austin Comd-in [Chief] at <location_mentioned>camp</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>

<p>N B He is well known to me perhaps you may not recall him 
immediately—having travelled with him and received service and assistance at
his hands perfectly disinterested I believe that he can be trusted to any
extent his abilities and infirmity may warrant</p>
