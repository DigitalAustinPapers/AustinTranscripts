<p><location_mentioned>Atoyac </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="05-22-1824">22 May 1824</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>your favour of the <date_mentioned n="04-20-1824">20 ultimo</date_mentioned> was handed me by y[our] <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned>
who spent the night here I read the out lines for the Federal 
Constitution, the <person_mentioned>Ammericans </person_mentioned>can find no fait with any part of it but<barker_pb n="797"/>
the 4th Article,—<person_mentioned>Mr Dill</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Capt Gains</person_mentioned> have returned from <location_mentioned>St
Antonio</location_mentioned> they speak very violently against the <person_mentioned>Counsel </person_mentioned>at that
place as being self created and having no power, etc <person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>took
out a petition signed by about 150 men. I saw nothing in this that
would be considered wrong or improper in the <location_mentioned>United States</location_mentioned> but
<person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>states that it was violently opposed in the <person_mentioned>Counsel </person_mentioned>
particularly by <person_mentioned>Baron de Bastrop</person_mentioned> who he states is opposed to this <location_mentioned>District</location_mentioned>
being settled by the <person_mentioned>Americans </person_mentioned>and that he rules the <person_mentioned>Counsel </person_mentioned>that
he <person_mentioned>Gains </person_mentioned>argued and disputed with the <person_mentioned>Counsel </person_mentioned>for 15 days but
could get nothing done owing to the opposition of the <person_mentioned>Barron</person_mentioned>, the
oppinion now circulating is that the <person_mentioned>Barron</person_mentioned>s opposition to this
<location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>is owing to self interest that if he can break up this
settlement that numbers would go to the <location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned>and the more
<person_mentioned>Setlers </person_mentioned>the more money for him as <person_mentioned>Survayor General</person_mentioned>—the answer
to the <person_mentioned>petitions </person_mentioned>and the insinuations of those persons returned from
<location_mentioned>St Antonio</location_mentioned> has caused much uneasiness to the <person_mentioned>setlers</person_mentioned>, as soon as I
learnt those things I proceeded with one of my <person_mentioned>neighbours </person_mentioned>to
<location_mentioned>Nacogdoches </location_mentioned>and had sufficient influence with <person_mentioned>Juan Segean</person_mentioned> (who is
acknowledged by <person_mentioned>Sálceuda [Saucedo]</person_mentioned> as the first <person_mentioned>Alcade</person_mentioned>) to get
him to issue a notice to all the <person_mentioned>Setlers </person_mentioned>in the <location_mentioned>District </location_mentioned>who wished
to live in the <location_mentioned>Mexican provinces</location_mentioned> as quiet peaceable, citizens and to
hold themselves in obedience to the laws and regulations of said
Government to come forward on the <date_mentioned n="06-06-1824">6th day of June</date_mentioned> to swear to
support the Mexican Constitution—this will satisfy all parties and
produce peace and harmony in the Country <person_mentioned>Mr Dill</person_mentioned> I conclude
you are acquainted with if you have been in his company. As to
<person_mentioned>Capt Gains</person_mentioned> I can truly say that in thirty years intercours with
mankind I have never been so much deceived and cheated by any
person as him. I state to you in confidence and I wish you to 
consider my statement as confidential, that this discription is his true
carractor, that he is a bladder of wind seeking popularrity that he
possesses a very inventive genius is very deceatfull and a most
abominable lyer if you detect him in a lie he will deny it without
a blush and produce such argiments as to convince a person not
acquainted with him that it was impossible that he could make
such a statement he has told a different story at allmost every
house he stoped at since his return, he is becoming generally
known, under those circumstances you may rest assur'd that we will
not permit him to ruin the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>by sowing the seeds of 
dissention among the <person_mentioned>Inhabitants</person_mentioned>,—I have been informed as a secret
that he has purchased a League of land of you but that he does
not wish the people of this <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>to know it—I have received<barker_pb n="798"/>
a letter from <person_mentioned>Seceuda </person_mentioned>the <person_mentioned>firs alcade</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>president of the Counsel
