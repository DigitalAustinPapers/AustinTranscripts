<p>Dr <person_mentioned>Brother</person_mentioned></p>

<p>I owed <person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned>, there was an unsettled a/c between us as well as
I recollect I gave him several notes for which he gave me a receipt which
is in my desk at <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>. I anticipate no kind of difficulty in settling
with <person_mentioned>William Austin</person_mentioned> as I have no doubt <person_mentioned>John </person_mentioned>kept all our accounts 
correctly.</p>

<p>It was understood that <person_mentioned>Westall</person_mentioned>'s note was not to be passed away to
any one, and that it should not be pressed untill the old man was able
to pay it, but this was a verbal understanding. I have been very careless
about all my private business and monied matters I wish them all settled.
<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>understands them better than anyone, and I believe better than
I do myself, speak to him about<person_mentioned> John</person_mentioned>'s account.</p>

<p>Try and get some money out of the <location_mentioned>lots at the mouth of the river</location_mentioned>—tho
do not sacrifice them for in a short time they ought to be worth something
handsome. I have <location_mentioned>two labors at the high ground back of the mouth of the
river near a lake—the place is called the Mound</location_mentioned>—do not sell them yet—
it is the highest land in that <location_mentioned>neighborhood</location_mentioned>. See whether <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>has
finished all the titles for my <location_mentioned>premium land</location_mentioned> and the <location_mentioned>three tracts I got of
<person_mentioned>Aguirre</person_mentioned></location_mentioned>. <person_mentioned>John Austin</person_mentioned> owed me for some money I paid to <person_mentioned>Don Fernando</person_mentioned>—
somebody, I forget his name. He is the <person_mentioned>son-in-law of old Ignacio Feres
in <location_mentioned>Bexar</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>. It was for a league of land—<person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>knows about it. <person_mentioned>Emily</person_mentioned>
must not be hasty in taking up prejudices against <person_mentioned>Williams</person_mentioned>, he has his fits
and starts and faults but I do not believe he is unfaithful to me. I have
done too much for him. If <person_mentioned>Wharton </person_mentioned>wishes to be friendly and makes any
motions towards a visiting state of matters between the families, meet it
kindly and let there be harmony but make no undue advances—tho I need
not say that to <person_mentioned>Emily </person_mentioned>for she courts no one, and wishes for harmony
with all. <person_mentioned>Mrs. Wharton</person_mentioned> is an amiable and talented woman.</p>

<p>A few fools do great harm to that <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>a silly letter from <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>
written I suppose by some one who only wants ears to be a jackass, and<barker_pb n="23"/>
a piece signed <person_mentioned>Pedralto </person_mentioned>have done great harm very great indeed—such men
deserve severe treatment from the <hi rend="italic">honest </hi>part of the community whose
interest they are trifling with.</p>

<p>You can show my other letters to <person_mentioned>Bell</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Martin</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>Miller </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>W. H. Jack </person_mentioned>etc.
I suppose that <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>McKinney </person_mentioned>have gone to <location_mentioned>Monclova </location_mentioned>and for
this reason I do not write to them If they have not gone tell them the
reason I have not written to them</p>

<p>God bless you all. I have no doubt I shall soon be at liberty Burn all
my letters date <date_mentioned n="10-06-1834">6 of last month</date_mentioned> and let no one see them.</p>
