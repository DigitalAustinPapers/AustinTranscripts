Broke open doors. Robbed of Money clothing and every thing they could
lay their hands on and dragged <person_mentioned>Dr Smithers </person_mentioned>from his bed and would have

possessed some little more of the milk of human kindness than the 
balance— I am directed by the <person_mentioned>Committee </person_mentioned>to ask for a <person_mentioned>detachment of 20 men
from the Main Army</person_mentioned> to protect this place and to assist in sustaining the
forces as they come on <person_mentioned>Capt Johnson</person_mentioned>, <person_mentioned>English </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Sublet </person_mentioned>can in all
