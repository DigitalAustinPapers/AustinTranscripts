<p><person_mentioned>Mr James Bryan</person_mentioned></p>

<p><location_mentioned>Durham Hall,</location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="12-04-1812"> Decr 4, 1812</date_mentioned>.</p>

<p>Dr Sr I recd your letters from <location_mentioned>Philadelphia </location_mentioned>by <date_mentioned n="12-03-1812">yesterday</date_mentioned>s mail
and noted the Contents, few events of my life has given me more
unhappjness than the detention of my son <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>with his Cargo in
<location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned> his last letter gave me reason to suppose that he would
soon leave the <location_mentioned>low Country</location_mentioned> and I hope to god he may have disposed
of his Cargo, and be on his way for <location_mentioned>Philadelphia</location_mentioned>. <date_mentioned n="1-03-1812">Yesterday </date_mentioned>brought
letters from <person_mentioned>Mrs Austin</person_mentioned> after her return from, <location_mentioned>New Haven</location_mentioned> but she
had not seen you when she wrote She expressed great Desire to see
you. I hope It may releive her mind when she has a Conversation
with you—</p>

<p>Would to god I could give you something pleasing on the Subject
of business, altho times was bad when you left this they are much
more depressed at this moment—the <person_mentioned>Indian </person_mentioned>War first put a general
stop to all business, by drawing of all the <person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>to the <hi rend="italic">frontier</hi>.
Since they returned the Weather has been most unfavourable to 
mining and little has been don[e]. <location_mentioned>Mine Shibboleth </location_mentioned>is nearly abandoned
and what remain are doing little, to Collect is almost out of the
question. I do not think any person about the <location_mentioned>Mines </location_mentioned>has Collected
as much as to pay the expenees of a Ride after the <person_mentioned>Debtors</person_mentioned>, that
has been the case with me and I know that its the same with Your
<person_mentioned>Brother </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>William Bates</person_mentioned>, the truth is nothing is doing, and both
money and Lead are equally difficult to obtain—and what makes
the matter Still more distressing, <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, that Lead when obtained will
not command Money at more than 3/50 <hi rend="italic">Cents, or—375</hi>. the reduced
price has driven most of the <person_mentioned>hands </person_mentioned>from the <person_mentioned>mines</person_mentioned>, many have
joined the <person_mentioned>companies of rangers</person_mentioned> and many inlisted under <person_mentioned>Capt Allen</person_mentioned>,
that you may be assured, that little lead will be made this <date_mentioned n="WInter-1812">Winter</date_mentioned>.
I have good prospects, in digging but the <date_mentioned n="Fall-1812">fall </date_mentioned>has been so rany that
many of my best leads of mineral are under Water</p>

<p>I wrote you some weeks past respecting a discovery of Antimony.
I have reced further information on that Subject, and have reason
to believe that its of consequence and if a lease can be obtained that
something great may be don[e] with it I hope to hear from you on
this Subject— Salt Peter, is, I understand in demand and a good
price.    I will thank you to inform the price in <person_mentioned>Philadelphia</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dry goods are not plenty and a good assortment would sell 
immediately but how the payments could be made is the question. A
good <location_mentioned>store at Herculaneum</location_mentioned> would do a good business, and command<barker_pb n="221"/>
both Lead and provisions, the Articles in demand are Linens and
Cotton goods Woolens, in general Country Linen— Iron and Steel,
Crockery of all kinds but mostly plates Bowls and Dishes, <hi rend="italic">Porter</hi>,
and, Bar Sugar and Spices of all kinds, good Tea Chocolate and in
short all kinds of articles in that way a general assortment, of Iron
Articles such as large Kittls Poots Skillets Spiders Cart and 
Waggon Boxes.</p>

<p>I do not think a doz. plates can be had in <person_mentioned>Saint Louis</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Saint
Geneveive</person_mentioned> such things with a Constant supply of Salt would 
command the best <person_mentioned>Customers</person_mentioned>, and prompt pay Salt Iron Steel Porter
Coffee Sugar command Cash and Lead much sooner then any Other
Articles but to, <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>, any kind of goods on Credit is absolute, <hi rend="italic">ruin</hi>, I
think I may make Sixty or Seventy thousand pounds of Lead 
between this and <date_mentioned n="Spring-1813">Spring</date_mentioned>. If my prospects continue and the Season
is not over, <hi rend="italic">rany</hi>, I think I have found a good Salt peter <hi rend="italic">Cave</hi>, I
shall Examin, it, and if it proves good shall work it With a few
<person_mentioned>hands</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>My Dear <person_mentioned>famely </person_mentioned>are constantly in my mind and I can say nothing
about a return—only I expect that <person_mentioned>Stephen </person_mentioned>in company with 
yourself will take Steps to bring then back.</p>

<p>As to News nothing of moment has taken place lately. Our War
measures goe on badly I think <person_mentioned>General Hopkins</person_mentioned> has returned to
<location_mentioned>Kentucky </location_mentioned>and Care[s] nothing what the <date_mentioned n="Spring-1813">spring </date_mentioned>may produce God
only knows</p>
