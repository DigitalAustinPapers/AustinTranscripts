<p><location_mentioned>Lexington Ky</location_mentioned> <date_mentioned n="07-03-1836">July 3rd 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Mr [Henry] Austin</person_mentioned> is at his <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>sister</person_mentioned>s (<person_mentioned>Mrs Holly</person_mentioned>)</location_mentioned> in this place he goes
<date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">in the morning </date_mentioned>with his <person_mentioned>sister </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Daughter </person_mentioned>to the <location_mentioned>Blue Licks</location_mentioned> for his
health and on his way to <location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned>. The late news of the rejection of the
treaty of <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned></hi> by his <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>.—has created a belief here that he and
his <person_mentioned>officers </person_mentioned>will be shot— I hope not. My opinion is that sound policy
has induced the <person_mentioned>friends of Santa Ana</person_mentioned> to make these threats against <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>
in order to preserve their places and that no attempt is intended to march
again on <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>— What is said and the preparations for War may enable
those in power to sustain themselves and in this way may be better able to
serve <person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned> than by attempting to nullify his treaty—still your 
<location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>Must not relax a moment in all the preparations for war as if the <person_mentioned>enemy</person_mentioned>
were at your doors— It is on that preparation you have most to rely for
peace. The report of the <person_mentioned>senate </person_mentioned>altho nothing more can be done this 
session is a great matter for you and leaves the rest to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—if she acts
wisely for the <date_mentioned n="04-xx-1837">next 9 months</date_mentioned> Our <person_mentioned>Congress </person_mentioned>will do all she wants</p>

<p>Harmony at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>and moderation in all your measures are the points of
the greatest Moment—public feeling is worth a kingdom. The folly of
<hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned></hi> in his <hi rend="italic">murderous </hi>orders has destroyed his fame and created for
<location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>a feeling too strong for the <hi rend="italic">power </hi>of <hi rend="italic"><location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned></hi>to Conquer— The
policy of liberating <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned></hi> is certainly improper at the present—While
a <person_mentioned>prisoner </person_mentioned>the whole plans of his <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>and his <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>remain
unsettled either release him or kill him and they at once are free to adopt
some regular plan against you and the injury to <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>would be most 
alarming in the divisions it must produce at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>and in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> as to the<barker_pb n="378"/>
wisdom of the measure and the Motives which lead to it— All remain
satisfied so long as no steps of liberating or killing is taken. The very
doubts on this head is advantageous to <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>—but take either step finally
and the danger of contending opinions at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>creates factions and in the
<location_mentioned>U S</location_mentioned> doubts and distrust of <person_mentioned>those in power in <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>— If <person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned> and
<person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>had been shot on the <location_mentioned>field of Battle</location_mentioned> the <location_mentioned>Civilized World</location_mentioned> Must have 
approved of the Justice of the Act however doubtful the policy may have
been—but your <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>stands committed to save them by the delay 
already and if future events do not impose the necessity of shooting it will
not do to adopt it— <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>has profited by the cruelties of <person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned> in
rousing the sympathy of the <location_mentioned>U S</location_mentioned> for her and she must not part with a grain
of that benefit by shooting any <person_mentioned>prisoner </person_mentioned>at this late period <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned></hi> is
no doubt a monster but <person_mentioned>Cos </person_mentioned>who has forfeited his life by the rules of war
acted under the orders of the other and may be the most worthy at any
rate he is in a situation to have more of public sympathy because it is 
believed he was forced to a breach of the rules of war by <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>Santa Ana</person_mentioned></hi>— A
nation gains immortal fame by even errors on the side of Humanity while
it can suffer irreparable injury by acts strictly Just but not called for by
the situation at <location_mentioned>home</location_mentioned>. On this head the <person_mentioned>best men of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> must deliberate
to satisfy the spirit of retaliation at <location_mentioned>home </location_mentioned>and high expectations of your
<person_mentioned>friends in the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> Delay is the only remedy for the former and as much
kindness as possible to the <person_mentioned>prisoners </person_mentioned>is the Course for the latter— <person_mentioned>Genl
Houston</person_mentioned> stands above all complaints which have reached this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, that
of delay appears to be the strongest, for which he deserves the highest
honors and all <person_mentioned>military men</person_mentioned> adopting the same tardy policy much suffer—
<hi rend="italic">prudence </hi>was called one of <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>s rascally virtues by <person_mentioned>Conway Lee</person_mentioned>
etc, but the man who has firmness to resist the <hi rend="italic">Current </hi>of his <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>at such
times deserves well of his <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>— The single circumstance of 
preserving a camp with the appearance of resistance—When <hi rend="italic">Panic </hi>was desolating
the <location_mentioned>Country </location_mentioned>is enough to place <person_mentioned>Genl Houston</person_mentioned> high in Military rank, the
Complaints against him are considered idle or the offspring of that 
impatient spirit so common in military life— You have a confidence in <person_mentioned>Genl
Houston</person_mentioned> of great worth and so long as he can serve <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>with the same
prudence it is wise to employ him. No man living save <person_mentioned>Genl Jackson</person_mentioned> could
have the same weight in your wars as [he]</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Major Grooms</person_mentioned> of the <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>from this . . .</p>
