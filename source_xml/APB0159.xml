<p><date_mentioned n="09-24-1809">Sept. 24. 1809</date_mentioned></p>
<p>My Dear Friend,</p>

<p>The Proclamation of the <person_mentioned>President of the U. States</person_mentioned> again 
inhibiting Intercourse with this <location_mentioned>Country</location_mentioned>, has arrived and excites the most
lively apprehension in the minds of the <person_mentioned>merchants connected with the
<location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>—great fears are expressed that War will be the consiquence
of the refusal of this <person_mentioned>Government </person_mentioned>to ratify <person_mentioned>Mr Erskine</person_mentioned>s agreement)-—
for myself, I am not without a confidant hope, that <person_mentioned>Mr. Jackson</person_mentioned> will
satisfactorily adjust all differences and place the relations of the two
<location_mentioned>Countries </location_mentioned>on the most friendly footing—</p>

<p>Owing to the high price of Cloths—the uncertain continuance of
Intercourse and the general unwillingness expressed by the 
<person_mentioned>merchants </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>manufacturers </person_mentioned>to ship Goods to the <location_mentioned>U States</location_mentioned> on Credit—
at least, on such reasonable terms of Credit as to promise a fair
profit on their sale in <location_mentioned>America</location_mentioned>—I had therefore detirmined to 
postpone any purchases, until confidence and a good understanding
should be restored between the two <location_mentioned>Countries</location_mentioned>—Nothing could have
proven more fortunate—since it would have been impossible for me
to have shiped the Goods before the arrival of the <person_mentioned>President</person_mentioned>s 
Proclamation which prohibits their entry into the <location_mentioned>U. States</location_mentioned> and I should
have found myself under the greatest embarrassment, had I made
the purchases and been under acceptences for the payment of the
amount in 12. or 15 months—while the Goods remained in 
<location_mentioned>England</location_mentioned>—locked up in the <location_mentioned>ware houses of Liverpool and London</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>For this season your orders must go unexecuted and how far it
may be in my power to execute them by the Spring Vessells (should
intercourse be restored) will principally depend on the restoration
of confidence—I have the prospect—nay almost the promise of the
support of a most respectable House-—who I have every reason to 
believe will grant me the aid of their credit and recommendation—if
so—I shall meet with no difficulty in obtaining every credit that I
may desire—</p>

<p>Your letter of the <date_mentioned n="05-20-1809">20th May</date_mentioned>—came to hand <date_mentioned n="09-23-1809">yesterday </date_mentioned>and is highly
satisfactory as it shows your continued confidence in the success
of the Lead Business with <person_mentioned>Mr Bond</person_mentioned>—I hope the revival of the 
Non-Intercourse Act will occasion no disappointment—I have <person_mentioned>Mr Bond</person_mentioned>s
Letter of the <date_mentioned n="07-03-1809">3d July</date_mentioned>—in which he mentions that <person_mentioned>Mess Bellows
and Cochran</person_mentioned> have accepted your Drafts for 5877 Dolls and that he
expected lead in 8 or 4 months to meet them—I persuade myself<barker_pb n="163"/>
that his expectation in this, as in every other instance where he may
place a confidence in your Engagements will be fully realised.</p>

<p>For some weeks all intercourse with <location_mentioned>France </location_mentioned>has been impossible—
but as the Grand Expedition has now returned from the <location_mentioned>Scheldt</location_mentioned>—
I am in hopes that some opportunity of getting to <location_mentioned>Holland </location_mentioned>will offer
in a few days—if so, I shall certainly embrace it—but I shall write
you again before I go.—</p>

<p>This Letter I send to the care of <person_mentioned>Mr Bond</person_mentioned> under the Expectation
that you will be at <location_mentioned>Boston </location_mentioned>and that he will hand it to you....</p>
