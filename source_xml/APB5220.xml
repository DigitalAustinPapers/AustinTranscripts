<p><location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-08-1836">July 8, 1836</date_mentioned></p>

<p><person_mentioned>Gen M. B. Lamar</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>president </person_mentioned>informs me that he will send you <person_mentioned>Gen Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter
to <person_mentioned>Gen. Urrea</person_mentioned>, and also a translation of <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>President
Jackson</person_mentioned></p>

<p>On my arrival here from the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> on the <date_mentioned n="06-27-1836">27th. ult.</date_mentioned> I found that much
excitement existed as to the past transactions with <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned> etc—
I saw him on the <date_mentioned n="07-02-1836">2d</date_mentioned>. and <date_mentioned n="07-03-1836">3d instant</date_mentioned> at <location_mentioned>Columbia</location_mentioned>, and he expressed to me
his desires to end the <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>war, on the basis of a recognition of <person_mentioned>Texan</person_mentioned>
independence by <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, and that he wished the <location_mentioned>U. S.</location_mentioned> to mediate between
the two parties (<location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>) on that basis—In accordance with this
view of the matter he wrote the letter to <person_mentioned>Gen Jackson</person_mentioned> (a translation of
which will be sent you by <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned>) requesting his (<person_mentioned>Jackson</person_mentioned>'s)<barker_pb n="390"/>
mediation— He also wrote the letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. Urrea</person_mentioned>, above mentioned, in
order to be used by this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. as it may deem best, for the purpose of 
procuring such guaranties from <person_mentioned>Gen. Urrea</person_mentioned> as would justify the <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. and
<person_mentioned>army of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> etc. so as to procure his (<person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s) liberty.</p>

<p>I understand that these letters will be sent to you by <person_mentioned>president Burnet</person_mentioned>, to
be used as circumstances and the public good may require—</p>

<p>I will observe that <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s opinion, in reference to his letters
to <person_mentioned>Urrea </person_mentioned>was that he, <person_mentioned>Urrea</person_mentioned>, would make a formal arrangement, by treaty
or agreement, with the commander of the <person_mentioned>Texan army</person_mentioned>, to withdraw all the
<person_mentioned>Mexican troops</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>beyond Rio Bravo</location_mentioned>, and submit the question to negotiation
for a final termination of the war, on the basis which he, <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> has
agreed to in the treaties of <date_mentioned n="05-17-1836">14 May</date_mentioned> and in his letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> etc,
give guarantees etc. etc.</p>

<p>I presume that <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> would agree to still stronger stipulations, on
his part, that is, so far as regards binding himself to use his influence to
procure an acknowledgement of our independence by <location_mentioned>Mexico </location_mentioned>etc</p>

<p>I think that <person_mentioned>Gen. Santa Anna</person_mentioned>'s letter to <person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned>, will have some
weight in procuring the intervention of the <location_mentioned>U.S.</location_mentioned> <hi rend="italic">as a mediator</hi> which I
think, will be fortunate for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, and will lead to a termination of the war
by an acknowledgement of our independence.</p>

<p>I also think that any treaty or arrangement made with <person_mentioned>Urrea</person_mentioned>, in a formal
manner, will be complyed with by him, for he is evidently at full liberty
to treat or not, and can have no excuse on that score, to deviate from what
he stipulates—</p>

<p>As to <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> he has bound himself, so far as a man in his situation
can, by the treaties made with this <person_mentioned>Govt</person_mentioned>. of <date_mentioned n="05-14-1836">14 May</date_mentioned>, and by his letter to
<person_mentioned>Gen. Jackson</person_mentioned> of <date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">4th. July</date_mentioned>, and I presume would bind himself still
stronger—</p>

<p>The part of the <person_mentioned>volunteers from <location_mentioned>Lexington Ky</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, have arrived, the balance,
about 200, in all, will be out in a few days—also a <person_mentioned>company of mounted
men</person_mentioned> under <person_mentioned>Charles Harrison</person_mentioned>, I am told are on the way— These are in
addition to the <person_mentioned>80 from <location_mentioned>Cincinnati</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> who have arrived at <location_mentioned>Galveston</location_mentioned>, under
<person_mentioned>Capt. Allen</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>The invincible, <person_mentioned>Cap Brown</person_mentioned>, has sailed on a cruise down the <location_mentioned>coast</location_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I will go to the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>if I can be of any service there</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Gen. M. B. Lamar</person_mentioned> In the <person_mentioned>Texas Army</person_mentioned></p>
