<p>[Translation by Austin]</p>

<p>The Supreme Executive Power appointed provisionally by the
<person_mentioned>Sovereign Mexican Constitutional Congress</person_mentioned> to all who shall see these
presents Know ye—that considering the great evils resulting to the
people from the abuse made of popular meetings, (juntas) to treat of
Subjects which are deemed by them of importance, when each one
of the Constituted Authorities has its limits and attributions 
designated and the conduct which they are to observe in the different
cases that may occur we have thought proper to resolve as a genl
principle</p>

<p>1- That all meetings, (juntas) or unions of whatever class they
may be which are not authorised by the laws are positively pro-<barker_pb n="723"/>
hibited and those who in violation of this decree form them, altho
they may have been invited to attend them, wheither <person_mentioned>private citizens</person_mentioned>
<person_mentioned>paisanos </person_mentioned><person_mentioned>Military </person_mentioned>or <person_mentioned>Eclesiastics</person_mentioned>, shall be punished severely and
without reprieve for having Committed a crime according to the
respective laws</p>

<p>2- Also it is prohibited that the <person_mentioned>corporations </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Authorities </person_mentioned>whose
attributions are designated by the laws shall Meet in one Body to
deliberate for the purpose of making representations, and to take
resolutions which are without the range of their powers</p>

<p>3—Also when in the case provided for in the last article a 
corporation exceeds its powers, it shall be responsible agreeable to the 
established laws</p>

<p>4- This decree shall be communicated to the <person_mentioned>Genl Staff</person_mentioned> and 
<person_mentioned>Commandant Generals</person_mentioned>, and <person_mentioned>local commandants</person_mentioned> and to the <person_mentioned>political chiefs</person_mentioned>
for its exact and punctual complyance</p>

<p>Therefore we command all powers to execute and obey this decree
in all its parts</p>
