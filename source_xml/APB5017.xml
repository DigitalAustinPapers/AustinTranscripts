<p>In addition to my communication by <person_mentioned>Colo McCombs</person_mentioned> I have dispatched
this <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>to urge on with all possible dispatch the battering cannon and
round shot— I must again repeat that it is useless to send Cannon without
round shot as well as grape or musket balls— <person_mentioned>Mr Farmer</person_mentioned> says there is
considerable round shot at <location_mentioned>Anahuac </location_mentioned>and some at <location_mentioned>Harrisburgh </location_mentioned>The <person_mentioned>army</person_mentioned>
will need Blankets, Shoes Coarse cloth, for pantaloons and Jackets,
Socks etc</p>

<p>I must earnestly and pressingly urge upon the <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>the absolute
necessity of organizing a <hi rend="italic"><person_mentioned>regular army</person_mentioned></hi> and inviting a <person_mentioned>Military man of
known and tried Talents</person_mentioned> to command it. I would suggest <person_mentioned>Genl. Carrol</person_mentioned> or
<person_mentioned>Genl Ripley</person_mentioned> though it matters not who, provided he is a man of <hi rend="italic">high</hi>
standing, integrity, influence and known military talents— I must also urge
more <person_mentioned>reenforcements</person_mentioned>.— The <person_mentioned>Army </person_mentioned>are anxiously awaiting news from the
<person_mentioned>convention</person_mentioned></p>

<p>To the <person_mentioned>President of the Consultation of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned></p>
<p>P. S. I also suggest the propriety of sending for a few Mortars and
bombs and an<person_mentioned> engineer corps</person_mentioned>—in short we <hi rend="italic">must have a <person_mentioned>regular army</person_mentioned></hi> and
<person_mentioned>regular officers</person_mentioned> and that without any delay— great promptness and energy
in the <person_mentioned>convention </person_mentioned>is necessary at this time— I am ready to mortgage all
my <location_mentioned>estate</location_mentioned> to raise funds—but we <hi rend="italic">must </hi>have system and a <person_mentioned>regular army</person_mentioned> and
a Genl of high military standing</p>
