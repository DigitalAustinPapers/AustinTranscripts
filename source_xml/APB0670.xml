<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I wrote you a few lines in a letter to my <person_mentioned>brother </person_mentioned>informing you
how your building place could be secured if you still wish for the
one you first picked out—on the subject you need not apprehend
any kind of difficulty as there will be none—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>Carter </person_mentioned>tells me you intend to plough up the <location_mentioned>Prairie </location_mentioned>and plant
this season—this is a very bad plan tho. you may think yourself
a better farmer than I am, and more capable of giving me advice—
but should cut down <location_mentioned>peach land</location_mentioned> in preferance to planting <location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>
10 acres of <location_mentioned>peach land</location_mentioned> will produce more than 20 of <location_mentioned>Prairie </location_mentioned>be-<barker_pb n="722"/>
sides you can get a dead cane break on the <location_mentioned>bank of the Bernard</location_mentioned> 6
or 7 Miles below, the use of which you are welcome to—but I 
advise you to put in <location_mentioned>peach land</location_mentioned> in preference to <location_mentioned>Prairie</location_mentioned>-
Advise all the <person_mentioned>new comers</person_mentioned> who are decent Men to go below I
wish to push the <location_mentioned>Settlement </location_mentioned>there so as to make it strong enough
to defend itself against the <person_mentioned>Indians</person_mentioned>—please enquire into the 
dispute between <person_mentioned>G Robinson</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Lynch </person_mentioned>and advise me what in justice
to both ought to be done If <person_mentioned>Newman </person_mentioned>does not go to the <location_mentioned>Colorado</location_mentioned>
advise him to go below—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>Mr J. H. Bell</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Compliments to <person_mentioned>Mrs. Bell</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Tong</person_mentioned>—My good friend <person_mentioned>J. H. 
Hawkins</person_mentioned> is dead. I have met with some things to vex me and fear my
best friends will sometimes think my temper a little unruly—-but
they must bear with me and in the end they will find that my heart
is right—</p>
