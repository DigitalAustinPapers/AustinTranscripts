<p><person_mentioned>Moses Austin Esqr</person_mentioned>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I expect, long before this you have red a line
written by our friend <person_mentioned>S. Hunt Esqr </person_mentioned>datd <date_mentioned n="01-30-1809">Jany. 30 1809</date_mentioned> informing
you of having forwarded to Messrs <person_mentioned>Barton </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Worts</person_mentioned>, Mess. <person_mentioned>Bellows</person_mentioned>
and <person_mentioned>Cochran </person_mentioned>letter of Credit. As no bills have yet been presented
for acceptance to Mess <person_mentioned>Bellows </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Cochran </person_mentioned>I have thot it 
possible <person_mentioned>Mr Hunt</person_mentioned>s letter [has not reached] you. However by applying
to Messrs <person_mentioned>Barton </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Worts </person_mentioned>you will find I have made 
arrangements for you to draw on My friends Messrs <person_mentioned>Bellows </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Cochran</person_mentioned>
for 7000 Dollars in drafts, not exceeding 3000 dols each. As yet
I have not learnt what kind of Lead will answer best at our 
<location_mentioned>Market</location_mentioned>—therefore you will be governed by your own judgment until I
write you again on the subject I expect you will write me and
enclose an instrument binding yourself, that I shall receive One half
of the nett proceeds of the Lead business in the consideration of
having furnished funds for you to draw for in prosecuting [the]
business. I like your arrangement much and I believe with you
that if this business is rightly managed we can make [some money]
for ourselves— [You will not forget] always to ensure the lead
before it starts from <location_mentioned>St. Genevieve</location_mentioned>.</p>
