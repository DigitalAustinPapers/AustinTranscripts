<p><date_mentioned n="12-07-1821">December 7th 1821</date_mentioned></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I Have seen a publication in a <location_mentioned>news paper</location_mentioned>, purporting to be an
extract of a letter, written by you at <location_mentioned>La Bahia, Province of Texas</location_mentioned>,
on the <date_mentioned n="09-01-1821">1st day of September 1821</date_mentioned> and addressed to a gentleman at
<location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>, wherein is set forth the advantages of a contemplated
settlement which you had in view in the above named province.</p>

<p>The extract above alluded to, states the following as the outline
which you propose to pursue in regard to the grants of lands: viz.
To give to each individual <person_mentioned>settler </person_mentioned>one tract of land binding on the
<location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>or some water course, half a mile in front, by two miles in
depth for farming—and one other tract of one a half mile square to
be located back from the <location_mentioned>river </location_mentioned>for vachery; and that to those <person_mentioned>settlers</person_mentioned>
who have <person_mentioned>families</person_mentioned>, you propose the following addition to their
grants:—to each <person_mentioned>married woman</person_mentioned> 160 acres, to each <person_mentioned>child </person_mentioned>80 acres,
and for each <person_mentioned>slave </person_mentioned>40 acres; to be laid off adjoining the farming tract;
and double those quantities adjoining the <location_mentioned>vachery tract</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>The object of this letter, is, to make some further enquiries about
the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>as it is probable, that I and some others in this State
may avail ourselves of the advantages which it holds forth.—</p>

<p>You mention in the extract referred to above, that it is important
that the <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>should arrive by the month of <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1822">February next</date_mentioned> at
farthest.—1. Will none be admitted after that time?— 2 If any be
admitted after that time, what time do you set as a limit to their
availing of themselves of the advantages of the <location_mentioned>settlement </location_mentioned>? 3. Has
the country fully secured its independence on <location_mentioned>Spain</location_mentioned>? 4. If it has
not, is there any certainty of its securing it? 5. How far is the
heart of it from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>?—6. How far is it from the <location_mentioned>sea<barker_pb n="442"/>
coast</location_mentioned>?—7. Or does it border thereon?—8. Does it join the <location_mentioned>territory
of the United States</location_mentioned>?—9. If not how far are they asunder?—10
Are there any <person_mentioned>settlers </person_mentioned>already in it?—11. If there are of what nation
are they?—12. Is it a healthy country?—13. How far is the town
site from <location_mentioned>New Orleans</location_mentioned>?</p>

<p>The answer to these queries, (together with any other necessary
information respecting the <location_mentioned>settlement</location_mentioned>, which you may think proper
to give) you will please transmit as early as possible by a letter 
addressed to me, at <location_mentioned>New Town, King and Queen County, Virginia</location_mentioned>. I
shall most anxiously wait for an answer from you.    —</p>
