<p>Dr. Sir. In consequence of some governmental arangement 
relative to this section of Country together with the liberal 
incoragement held out to persons disposed to emigrate to your <location_mentioned>Colony</location_mentioned>, I
have concluded to accept the invitation, provided I can get a good
settlement on the <location_mentioned>Brassos </location_mentioned>or <location_mentioned>St Barnard</location_mentioned> as near the <location_mentioned>sea coast</location_mentioned> as may
be practicable. I intend following the agricultural business and
wish to have a farm on or near the navigable waters.</p>

<p>Although I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance yet I hope
you will be good enough to make the selection, as it is not convenient
for me to attend at present. I wish to obtain as much land as I
may be intitled to, agreeable to your system of distribution. My
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>consists of myself, my <person_mentioned>wife </person_mentioned>and a few <person_mentioned>negroes </person_mentioned>six of which
<person_mentioned>negros </person_mentioned>are fit for <person_mentioned>field hands</person_mentioned>. I have documents which will, I
presume, entitle me to admitance. If you should think proper to
comply with this request and notify me thereof I will come on 
immediately and comply with your conditions of sale, and move my
<person_mentioned>family </person_mentioned>on as soon as may be practicable. I have a crop of cotton on
hand, which perhaps, will detain me till <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1825">January</date_mentioned>.</p>
