<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I staid <date_mentioned n="10-05-1835">last night</date_mentioned> at <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Perry</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned> and all were quite well except <person_mentioned>Eliza </person_mentioned>who
has been quite sick but is now nearly recovered. Much excitement is now
felt <location_mentioned>in this sction</location_mentioned> in consequence of a report that <person_mentioned><hi rend="italic">2000 </hi>troops</person_mentioned> are to land
in a few days at the <location_mentioned>mouth of the Brazos</location_mentioned>. The origin of this report was a
letter written by <person_mentioned>Samuel Powell</person_mentioned> to his <person_mentioned>mother </person_mentioned>assuring her that it was an
unquestionable fact and cautioning her to be prepared for the worst. There
are many here still, who are willing to march to the assistance of their
<person_mentioned>countryman </person_mentioned>at <location_mentioned>Gonzales</location_mentioned>, did they think it prudent for any more to leave.
Is there not at any rate a strong probability that a descent may be made
upon this <location_mentioned>coast </location_mentioned>should they know it to be unprotected? And would it not
be prudent that a portion of our <person_mentioned>forces </person_mentioned>should stay to defend it in case of
necessity? Would there not be great danger from the <person_mentioned>Negroes </person_mentioned>should a
large <person_mentioned>Mexican force</person_mentioned> come so near? Your information on this subject is
doubtless much better than ours and your opinion would be listened to
with much confidence and satisfaction. The most vulnerable point should
certainly be the best protected one—did we know where that is, I am 
confident we would hasten to it. Many false rumors are in circulation, it is
important to know the truth as near as possible.</p>
