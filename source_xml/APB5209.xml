<p>Plans of Santa Anna to secure mediation of President Jackson. Advises discreet treatment of the army to avoid friction with Houston </p>

<div1 type="body">

<p>At <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>J. H. Bell</person_mentioned>s</location_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-02-1836"> Saturday July 2 1836.</date_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr. Sir,</p>

<p>I have seen <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned>—he will write a letter to <person_mentioned>president Jackson </person_mentioned>
requesting his mediation to terminate the war on the basis of a recognition
of <location_mentioned>Texan </location_mentioned>independence etc. I will send this letter by the <person_mentioned>express </person_mentioned>to <person_mentioned>Gen.
Gains</person_mentioned> and also a copy of it to him (<person_mentioned>Gains</person_mentioned>)</p>

<p>I am satisfied that <person_mentioned>Santa Anna</person_mentioned> wishes to end the war and stop the advance
of the <person_mentioned>Mexican army</person_mentioned>— how is this to be done?— you will answer me by
asking the same question— When I come down I will try to answer it.</p>

<p>The <person_mentioned>volunteers </person_mentioned>lately arrived at <location_mentioned>Galveston </location_mentioned>(<person_mentioned>Allen's company</person_mentioned>) I think
ought to be sent to the town of <location_mentioned>Matagorda </location_mentioned>with all their provisions—also
<person_mentioned>Wilson's and Harrison's corps</person_mentioned> as soon as they arrive, (they are from 
<location_mentioned>Lexington </location_mentioned>and <location_mentioned>Louisville</location_mentioned>) The <person_mentioned>commander of the army</person_mentioned> will of course be
informed by you of all the orders that are issued as to the concentration of
<person_mentioned>troops </person_mentioned>and supplies at the town of <location_mentioned>Matagorda</location_mentioned>— By his dispatch of <date_mentioned n="05-22-1836">22 ult.</date_mentioned>
he informs you that he intended to fall back to <location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Casey</person_mentioned>s on Colorado</location_mentioned> which
is only <location_mentioned>25 miles above Matagorda</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I think that some prudence is necessary to avoid discord with <person_mentioned>Gen 
Houston</person_mentioned>— any precipitate action by you, at this time, may create an 
excitement in the <person_mentioned>army </person_mentioned>and will do it—</p>

<p>The whole <location_mentioned>country </location_mentioned>is turning out, so far as I have heard
Is there any news from the <person_mentioned>Yellow Stone</person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Williams </person_mentioned>etc
I think I will be down as far as <person_mentioned>Perry </person_mentioned><date_mentioned n="07-04-1836">day after tomorrow</date_mentioned>—</p>

<p><person_mentioned>S. F. Austin</person_mentioned> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <person_mentioned>President Burnet</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>Velasco </location_mentioned><person_mentioned>Mr Tennille</person_mentioned></p>
