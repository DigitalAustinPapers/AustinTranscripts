<p>Failure to hold meeting at Troy. War stores.</p>

<div1 type="body">

<p>My Dear <person_mentioned>General</person_mentioned>,</p>

<p>I am here still with my <person_mentioned>family</person_mentioned>, and much engaged in settling my old
private affairs, which I once mentioned to you. I have had a proposition
from the <person_mentioned>persons who have had my property in charge</person_mentioned>, and they have 
offered me $15,000 to release them, and I have charged $35,000, and a 
settlement of $30,000 on my <person_mentioned>wife</person_mentioned>. They have till <date_mentioned n="06-05-1836">day after tomorrow</date_mentioned> to accept.
My estate is worth $120,000, by their own admissions, and I shall secure
some $80,000, if I go into a <person_mentioned>Chancery </person_mentioned>suit, but as that will keep me out of
it for some two or three years and perhaps more, I am determined to close
at once by a sacrifice, provided I can do so on the terms I have offered. If
they accept, it is my intention to charter a vessel from <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned> and sail
<date_mentioned n="07-xx-1836">next month</date_mentioned> for <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>. I want much to know the prospects of a 
continuance of the war, and I can bring out two or <person_mentioned>three hundred volunteers</person_mentioned>. I
have also written to <person_mentioned>Colt of <location_mentioned>Patterson</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> to inquire the prices of his ten
charge rifles, carbines and pistols, and I want to bring out what will be
most useful to the <location_mentioned>country</location_mentioned>, and dispose of it for <location_mentioned>lands</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>I have not been able to get up a meeting in <location_mentioned>Troy </location_mentioned>at all. I went there
and saw the <person_mentioned>Mayor </person_mentioned>and <person_mentioned>Recorder </person_mentioned>and several of the <person_mentioned>leading men of the
<location_mentioned>City</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, and I received a letter from the <person_mentioned>Mayor </person_mentioned>a few days since stating that
there appeared so much apathy on the subject, that he was fearful that the
attempt would fail. I have not been able to do any thing more in <location_mentioned>Albany</location_mentioned>
than get a <location_mentioned>Memorial </location_mentioned>circulated, which has received a great many signatures,
and will go to <location_mentioned>Washington</location_mentioned>. I do not think I can do any thing of 
importance in the <location_mentioned>West </location_mentioned>in the way of collecting funds—in fact the scarcity of
money is so great here that, I find the <person_mentioned>people </person_mentioned>very unwilling to give.
I wish you would inform me if cannon are needed for the fortification
now in progress— If horses could be promised<person_mentioned> 100 men</person_mentioned>, provided I could
bring them out with the equipments and arms— I am inclined to think that
<person_mentioned>100 cavalry</person_mentioned> with Colts carbines, with spring bayonets, and pistols, will
be a very powerful and efficienct force. Colts carbins and pistols discharge
30 rounds in the same time that it takes to load 3 times. If I get cannon too,.
I would have them with the percussion locks, which we saw at <location_mentioned>Arculanius
N. Y. State Arsenal</location_mentioned>.</p>

<p>If you can learn anything of <person_mentioned>Wm Austin</person_mentioned>, I beg you will also let me know
for the satisfaction of his <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>here. I am also very anxious to receive a<barker_pb n="366"/>
copy of the Constitution, and some of the important laws of the <person_mentioned>New Govt</person_mentioned>,
and please address me at <location_mentioned>New York</location_mentioned>, and advise me of your movements.</p>

<p><person_mentioned>A. J. Yates</person_mentioned></p>
