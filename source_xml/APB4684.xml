<p><location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned>, <date_mentioned n="10-15-1834">October 15, 1834</date_mentioned>.</p>
<p><person_mentioned>Mr. Geo. Fisher</person_mentioned></p>

<p>Dr. Sir, I sincerely congratulate you on the appointment you have recd
in the <location_mentioned>custom house of Matamoros</location_mentioned>, and hope you may long continue to
enjoy prosperity and peace,</p>

<p>The experience of the last few years has taught me a great deal—I have<barker_pb n="9"/>
learned more of mankind, and of the human passions than I was ever 
willing to believe before— My frankness and open, candid, good faith has
involved me in many difficulties—and my confidence in Others has 
entangled me very much, but all this will be useful to me for the future—that
is if I ever get out of this <location_mentioned>prison</location_mentioned>, which I hope to do soon—</p>

<p>Two of my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>arrived today from <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, with representations in my
favor from the <person_mentioned>Ayuntamtos of <location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned> and <person_mentioned>Govt of the <location_mentioned>State of Coahuila and
Texas</location_mentioned></person_mentioned>, wrhich I think will have a favourable effect.</p>

<p>On the <date_mentioned n="10-06-1834">6th of this month</date_mentioned> I wrote to my <person_mentioned>friends </person_mentioned>in <location_mentioned>Texas </location_mentioned>on the subject
of representing, but as the above representations have arrived, it will not
now be necessary for them to do so, and I must request the favor of you
to write to my <person_mentioned>brother in law James F Perry</person_mentioned> care of <person_mentioned>M. A. Bryan</person_mentioned> <location_mentioned>San
Felipe</location_mentioned> informing him that the representations sent by <person_mentioned>Mr. Grayson</person_mentioned> have
been recd and that he need not procure any more, as I requested him to
do in my letter to him date <date_mentioned n="09-06-1834">6th of last month</date_mentioned>— I presume you will receive
this letter before<person_mentioned> Capt. Offutt</person_mentioned> leaves <location_mentioned>Matamoros</location_mentioned>, and you can write by
him— It will be best to send this letter to<person_mentioned> Mr. Perry</person_mentioned>— I wish it also
for another reason which is this—I have long since informed my 
in
<location_mentioned>Texas</location_mentioned>, that I am satisfied with you, and was your friend— By sending
this letter they will have an additional evidence of the terms of friendship
on which we stand, I will take this occasion to thank you, for the letters
and statements you have written to this city in my favor-— The only time
to try friendship is when a man is in misfortune and persecuted by a host
of powerful <person_mentioned>enemies </person_mentioned>as I am— You have interested yourself for me even
at the risk of injuring yourself— I wish my family to know this—they,
will not forget it— For these reasons I wish you to send this letter to
my <person_mentioned>brother in law James F. Perry</person_mentioned>—</p>

<p>I am in better spirits, and my prospects are much better than they were
when <person_mentioned>Capt. Offutt</person_mentioned> left and I hope that a few months will release me from
my long and dreary imprisonment.</p>

<p>My motto has always been <hi rend="italic">fidelity to <location_mentioned>Mexico</location_mentioned></hi>— I have never deviated
from it—but I have been greatly entangled by others, and by circumstances
that I could not controul— I have suffered much, but a clear and quiet
conscience has enabled me to bear it with fortitude, There is nothing new
except what you will see in the public papers—that is nothing that I know
of—all is peace and <hi rend="italic">Federacion </hi>seems to be the Order of the day— Some
however think that <date_mentioned n="01-xx-1834">January </date_mentioned>and <date_mentioned n="02-xx-1834">February </date_mentioned>will be stormy months— Congress have certainly a very difficult and delicate task before them— God<barker_pb n="10"/>
give them wisdom and prudence to regulate matters so as to insure peace
and prosperity to this republic.</p>
