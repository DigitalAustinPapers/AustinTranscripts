<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>Agreeable to your [request] of the <date when="1824-12-22">22. of Decr</date> I Cald on <persName>Mr
Lynch</persName> <persName>Mr Scott</persName> and <persName>Straing</persName> and finding it would be the saim difficulty as before owing to the Pertinaciousness of <persName>Lynch</persName> I named 6
Men and alowed him to object to any he did not like the other
Two agreed to the saim men we appointed the <date when="1825-01-01">1st of Janry</date> to Meet
<persName>Mr Hughs</persName> and Two of the <persName>Arbitrators </persName>not appiering<persName> Mr L</persName> wanted
to appoint another day he not greeing to name any Two that was
present we proceded to lay of the <placeName>Labor </placeName><persName>Mr L</persName>] Cald in <persName>John 
Taylor</persName> to prove Conditional Lines between <persName>Straing</persName> and <persName>Scoot </persName>it also
appierd that <persName>Lynch</persName> extend his claim at different times it was since
a falling out betwen him and <persName>Straing</persName> that he Claimed the spot he
was contending for <persName>Straing</persName> setled by Consent of parties inclosed
you have a copy of the decision which in my oppinion is a Just one
and have don equal Justice to all parties&#8212;I with pleasure inform
you this is the first business of any consequence I have don as 
<persName>Alcalde</persName> and is in hopes that my time of service will expire more 
agreable than I expected&#8212;I wish to call your attention to setting a 
<placeName>permanent ferry </placeName>on the <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> at the <placeName>Mouth of Buflow Byo</placeName> we
laibour under a grait disadvantage at present It is the most 
<placeName>central place</placeName> to do business in this district and I expect the <placeName>main 
thoroughfare rode</placeName> will be this way I thinck it ought not to be left at
the will of those who taick it in their tract of land and live at a
distance I have been thinking of several wais such as laíng a 
Labore or reserveing a place for a Town you are the best Judge I
know of no person wishing to settle there but am certain  [there<pb n="1011"/>
would be some if some] regulations wair made. There has been
some taulck of cuting a road from <placeName>Bufflow B</placeName> and crossing the <placeName>San
Jacinto</placeName> at my House it would be much the shorter and perhaps the
best but I thinck we have better spend our time in raising Corn as
yet</p>

not procure any here</p>
