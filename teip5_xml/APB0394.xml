<p><placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>, July 1, 1821.</p>
<p>Dear Sir&#8212;I am now this far on my journey to the <placeName>Province of
Texas</placeName>, to take possession of the lands granted to my <persName>Father</persName>, <persName>Col.
Moses Austin</persName>, (formerly of <placeName>Mine a Burton, Missouri</placeName>) by the <persName>Spanish
government</persName>.</p>

<p>The land lies on the <placeName>Colorado and Brassos rivers</placeName>, and includes a
situation on the <placeName>Bay of St. Bernard</placeName>, suitable for a <placeName>sea-port</placeName>, at which
place a <placeName>port of entry</placeName> is ordered to be established. This concession
to my <persName>father </persName>is granted by <persName>Don Joaquin de Arredondo the governor
of the <placeName>Internal Provinces</placeName></persName>, and is duly confirmed by the <persName>Supreme
Council of those <placeName>Provinces</placeName></persName> dated <date when="1821-01-17">17th January, 1821</date>, at <placeName>Monterey</placeName>.
It contains a permission to settle <persName>three hundred families</persName> on the lands
to each of whom a tract of land is to be given and to whom most
liberal privileges are secured, both in regard to commercial 
intercourse and civil rights.</p>

<p>The Constitution of <placeName>Spain </placeName>is in full operation at those provinces
and recent accounts state that the beneficial effects of it are already
perceptible.</p>

<p>The <placeName>gold and silver mines</placeName> are getting into more extensive 
operation than they have for many years. Money is becoming more
abundant, a free trade is permitted, and the restrictive system 
heretofore pursued in regard to <persName>foreigners </persName>has been superseded by the most
liberal encouragement.</p>

<p><persName>Don Joseph Erasmo Seguin</persName>, a Spanish gentleman from <placeName>San
Antonio</placeName> was despatched by <persName>governor Martinez</persName> for the express 
purpose of informing my <persName>father </persName>of the confirmation of his <placeName>grant </placeName>by the
<persName>governor general</persName>, and to invite back all the <persName>fugitive Spaniards</persName> who
fled in the revolution of <date n="xx-xx-1812">1812</date>, and are living at this place, most of
whom, I am informed, will return to their country again.</p>

<p>I go in company with <persName>Don Erasmo</persName>, and have a large company of
<persName>American companions</persName> besides the <persName>Spaniards</persName>.</p>

<p>Should you yet meet with any <persName>Farmers </persName>of good character or
<persName>mechanics</persName>, who wish to emigrate to this fine country and participate
in the advantages secured to my <persName>father </persName>by this <placeName>grant</placeName>, you will oblige
me by informing them that they can procure every information on
this subject by writing to my <persName>father</persName>, <placeName>Herculaneum, Missouri</placeName>; but
they must be well recommended.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
