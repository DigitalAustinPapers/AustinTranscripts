<p><placeName>Natchitoches </placeName><date when="1827-02-18">Feby, 18-1827</date></p>
<p>Dr. Sir:</p>

<p>I have just Recd by <persName>Mr Dubois</persName> your favour of the <date when="1827-02-09">9th Inst: </date>the 
receipt of which gave me great pleasure as <persName>Mr Dubois</persName> Returns in an
hour I have time only to Acknowledge the Receipt of your letter,
to Bundle up in a hurry a few <placeName>news papers</placeName> for you. <persName>Mr Dubois</persName> tells
me <persName>Mr Ranaz</persName> will leave here in two days by him you shall hear from
me again. I am now in tolerable health though for <date n="06-xx-1826">eight months past
</date>I have been sick half the time. I am happy to hear of the 
Restoration of tranquility at <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>I with pleasure heard of the
unanimity of the <persName>People of your <placeName>colony </placeName></persName>to support Govt there
never was a more silly, wild, Quicksotic scheme than that of 
<placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, and all sober honest thinking <persName>people </persName>here view it in the same
light&#8212;I wish it was in my Power to communicate to you the 
stipulations of a Treaty now before the <persName>senate of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName></persName> Relative to the
<placeName>Boundaries </placeName>between us and <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, such a treaty has been signed
by the <persName>Ministers of the two governments</persName>, but what will be the future
<placeName>Boundary </placeName>is not made public.&#8212;I wish we may Embrace your
<placeName>Colony</placeName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>You will find in the <placeName>Washington Paper</placeName> of the <date when="1827-01-15">15th Ult</date>: some very
important <placeName>European </placeName>News, all <placeName>Europe </placeName>may be embroiled in war.
God protect the <placeName>United States</placeName> from that calamity, if we should be
drawn into it, it will be about <placeName>The Island of Cuba</placeName>, we cannot suffer
<placeName>England </placeName>to hold it, they have already shut their <placeName>colonial Ports</placeName>
against our vessels, they will do the same in the <placeName>Ports of Cuba
</placeName>should they occupy it. You mention <placeName>Trinity </placeName>the <placeName>Aishe Bayou</placeName> and
perhaps <placeName>Sabine</placeName>; is it not possible for you to come as far as this place
when you are so near us ? I am sorry to hear of the Death of <persName>George
Smyth</persName>, an event long expected, indeed he lived longer than I
thought he could when I last saw him.   I have no time to Enlarge<pb n="1605"/>
this letter as the <persName>bearer </persName>setts off so soon. You will hear from me
again in <date when="1827-02-21">two or three days</date> In the mean time take this opportunity
to assure you of my verry great Esteem and Regard</p>

<p><persName>John Sibley</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>Note, your expressions of Lenity towards the <persName>Prisoners </persName>are 
humane to the Extream, the Crime of high treason could in no Govt
be passed over so lightly, I am but slightly acquainted with any of
them but most with the worthless unprincipled <persName>Seymour</persName></p>

<p>The <persName>Honble. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Honble. Stephen F. Austin</persName> at <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName></p>
