<p>Duplicate   Orig: per Hetta</p>

<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1830-06-02">June 2nd 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>Colonel Stephen F. Austin</persName>,</p>

<p>My Dear Sir, The object of the present communication being
one of considerable Interest to me, I have to beg you will address me
by the first opportunity, freely and candidly in relation to the 
political aspect of the affairs of your <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212; My Stand is taken, and
the moment you say my services are required I obey the summons,
but unless you can as a <persName>friend </persName>advise me to bring my <persName>family </persName>the
ensuing <date n="Fall - 1830">fall</date>, I shall decide upon leaving them in this <placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212;
of course I shall be undecided how to act until I hear from you&#8212;
From the observations in the public prints, I must suppose that
the Government are no longer willing to pursue the same course
of liberal conduct towards the <placeName>Colonies </placeName>they have heretofore, and
therefore as a <persName>colonist </persName>I wish to know the attitude we will assume
with sentiments of the highest respect and sincere regard I remain
your friend and obedient servant</p>

<p><persName>S. Rhoads Fisher</persName>-</p>

<p><date when="1830-06-13">June 13th: 1830</date></p>
<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The foregoing you will perceive is duplicate, and as I shall leave
here in a day or two, on my way to my family in <placeName>Northumberland,
Penna</placeName>: I cannot refrain from again saying I am an "<persName>Austinian</persName>," and
urging you to write me whatever may Interest us to know-
By a notice in one of the <placeName>late papers </placeName>I perceive <persName>Colonel Fisher
the collector for the <placeName>port of Galveston</placeName></persName> requires vessels to furnish
him with their <placeName>manifests </placeName>at the <placeName>mouth of the Brasos</placeName>, as this will
subject me to delay on my voyage <placeName>from Philadelphia to Matagorda</placeName>,
I should feel indebted to you to ask <persName>Colonel Fisher</persName> if I cannot go
direct to <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>, and forward him the <placeName>Manifest </placeName>to such point as
he may direct&#8212;</p>

<p>Remember Colonel on you I depend for the successful result of
my petition, and hope soon to hear from you on the subject, as
also upon any commercial changes the Government may see proper
to make&#8212;</p>

<p>Lest you may not receive the paper, I copy the following 
paragraph from <placeName>the Argus</placeName> of <date when="1830-06-11">11th: Inst</date>:&#8212;</p>

<p><placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;The <placeName>National Gazette</placeName> publishes extracts from an official paper
submitted to the<persName> Mexican Congress</persName> in secret session, by the <persName>secretary of
state,</persName> the tenor of which is extremely hostile to the <persName>American settlers in
<placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>.</p>
