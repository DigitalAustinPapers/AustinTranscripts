<p><persName>Wm. H. Wharton Esq</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have noticed in the <placeName>newspapers </placeName>your appointment as <persName>Commissioner from
<placeName>Texas </placeName>to the <placeName>U. States</placeName></persName> for the purpose of negociating loans and making
other arrangements for the advancement of the <persName>Texan </persName>cause. I saw a 
<persName>gentleman</persName>, a few days since, who informed me that he came with you to <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> and that you would in a few days probably be in <placeName>Nashville</placeName>. I
have therefore embraced the opportunity of addressing you a line for the
purpose of making some enquiries and of making a conditional proposal
for raising a <persName>corps for the service of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>. A <persName>brother </persName>of mine is now an
<persName>officer </persName>of some experience in the service of the <placeName>U. States</placeName> and if he could be
assured of a proper reception in <placeName>Texas </placeName>would, I have no doubt, resign, raise
a respectable <persName>corps </persName>and devote himself to the service of the rising <placeName>state</placeName>.
He is well qualified as an <persName>engineer </persName>and <persName>tactician</persName>, having graduated among
the distinguished at <placeName>West Point Academy</placeName> and having served five or six<pb n="308"/>
years in different <persName>corps</persName>; latterly in the <persName>Dragoons</persName>. His plan is to raise a
<persName>regiment </persName>if possible of <persName>mounted riflemen</persName> and offer them to the service of
<placeName>Texas</placeName>. The place of rendezvous proposed is <placeName>Jackson </placeName>in the <placeName>Western 
District</placeName>. He is at present at <placeName>Fort Des Moines</placeName>, but will be in <placeName>Baltimore </placeName>and
<placeName>Washington City</placeName> <date n="03-xx-1836">early in March</date>. Would such a <persName>corps </persName>be accepted? For
what time must they be engaged? How long in your opinion will the war
continue? Will <placeName>Texas </placeName>pay the expenses of the <persName>corps </persName>from the time they
are embodied and will some advance be made for procuring the necessary
equipments</p>

<p>I am informed that you will probably be at <placeName>Washington City</placeName> in <date n="03-xx-1836">March</date>.
If so, I and my <persName>brother </persName>will meet you there at that time and enter into some
definite arrangements if the proposal is accepted. In the mean time you
will oblige me with a speedy answer.&#8212; Some <persName>persons </persName>are of the opinion
that the war will be speedily ended. I am not of that opinion but cannot
now enter into my reasons for coming to a different conclusion; but will
give them when I have a more convenient opportunity&#8212;With great respect</p>

<p><persName>Wm. W. Lea.</persName></p>

<p>I write in haste and you will excuse errors</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Wm H Wharton Esq</persName> <placeName>Nashville Tennessee</placeName></p>
<p>[Postmark:] <placeName>Eaton T</placeName> <date when="1836-01-19">Jany 19th</date> Free <persName>Wm. W. Lea</persName> <persName>P. M</persName>.</p>
