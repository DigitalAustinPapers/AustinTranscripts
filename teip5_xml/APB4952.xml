waggons Stores etc.</p>

<p><persName>Mess J. Wharton</persName> and <persName>Henry Smith</persName> arrived from <placeName>below </placeName><date when="1835-10-13">yesterday </date>with
the pleasing news of <persName>Capt Moore</persName>s vessel having arrived from <placeName>N. 0</placeName>&#8212;with

procured to load at <placeName>Columbia </placeName>and forward ammunition flour arms etc. to you
the originals of your invitation to the <persName>members of the Consultation</persName> (to
proceed to <placeName>camp</placeName>) have been Sent to <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#8212; No <persName>members </persName>have
yet assembled there&#8212; You will please take into consideration the Situation
of this <persName>Council </persName>whose powers will cease when the convention goes into
operation&#8212;several of these are <persName>delegates</persName>&#8212;<persName>R R. Royall</persName> and <persName>Joseph Bryan</persName>&#8212;
who deem their remaining here much more important at this moment, than
that they should proceed to <placeName>camp </placeName>to the <persName>consultation</persName>&#8212; You will please
provide for the continuance of a body of some kind at this place with
power sufficient to provide for Such requisitions as may be made by the

at <placeName>San Antonio </placeName>to lay before it all such matters as from time to time we
will transmit to you together with the foregoing&#8212;in order that they may
be confirmed We have deemed it necessary to issue to <persName>Capt Hall</persName> orders
for pressing into the Service waggons and all property that may be 
required&#8212;perhaps it would be well to make out an appointment clothing the
individual with all the powers necessary to press and take into the public
Service etc. as <persName>contracter</persName></p>

<p>We have nothing further to advise you of but to request that you will
give Us sufficient notice of what supplies may be required&#8212;for the <date n="11-xx-1835">next

supplies.</p>
