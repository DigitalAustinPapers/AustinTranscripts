<p><placeName>Charleston </placeName><date when="1832-10-14">14 October 1832</date></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I <date when="1832-10-13">yesterday </date>received your letters of the <date when="1832-08-13">13</date> and <date when="1832-08-29">29 August</date> and
am very much indebted to you for this mark of your kind remem-<pb n="876"/>
brance as well as for the intelligence they contain&#8212; I am really
sorry to find that <placeName>Mexico </placeName>should continue to be so convulsed even
after the <persName>arch fiend</persName> has left the <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212; What will <persName>Pakenham</persName>
say now&#8212; I did not raise the insurrection this time nor am I
in anyway the cause of the revolt in the <placeName>States</placeName>-&#8212; It is inconceivable
that he and his <persName>friend </persName>should have been so weak as to attribute
to me what is owing to the character of the <persName>people </persName>and their 
ignorance of self government&#8212; I dare say you will get along very well
with <persName>Fagoaga</persName>, but doubt whether you will have long to get on
with him&#8212; He has not I think, talents for the place he fills&#8212;
You seem in the dark as [to] his predilections and the cause of
<persName>Pakenham</persName>'s coolness and even dissatisfaction with the appointment
and I can account for both and give you a little secret history,
which may be of use to you In <persName>Alaman</persName>'s first reign as <persName>Secretary
of State</persName>, he desired to send this very <persName>Fagoaga </persName>to <placeName>London</placeName>-&#8212; <persName>Victoria</persName>
objected and<persName> Mr. Ward</persName> objected; but <persName>Alaman </persName>who had at heart this
nomination addressed himself severally to the <persName>President </persName>and the
<persName>british Charge</persName>&#8212; To the <persName>President </persName>he said that he ought to 
overcome his objections because <persName>Mr. Ward</persName> had expressed an earnest
desire to have <persName>Fagoaga </persName>appointed to his <persName>Court</persName>&#8212;and to <persName>Ward </persName>that
the <persName>President </persName>desired this so much that he thought the objections
he had advanced ought to be withdrawn&#8212;</p>

<p>At length an eclaricissiment took place between the <persName>parties</persName>&#8212; The
<persName>President </persName>apologised and expressed his regret that he could not
oblige <persName>Mr. Ward</persName> in this matter, the other was stupefied&#8212; They
mutually explained, and agreed that the <persName>secretary </persName>had sought to
serve them both a scurvy trick&#8212; <persName>Ward </persName>called at my <placeName>house </placeName>on his
return from this interview at the <placeName>palace </placeName>He was shocked at the
duplicity of <persName>Alaman</persName>&#8212; He then told me, that <persName>Fagoaga</persName>'s 
predelections were altogether french&#8212;that he was a Bourbonite and that it
was certain the <persName>french ambassador in <placeName>London</placeName></persName> would be instantly
informed of every thing which passed between <persName>Mr Canning</persName>
and the <persName>Mexican Envoy</persName> He was right&#8212;all the <persName>Fagoaga</persName>'s are
<persName>french </persName>in their predilections&#8212;<persName>Jose Maria </persName>desired the ratification
of the plan of <placeName>Iguala </placeName>and treaties of <placeName>Cordova </placeName>and so did this
<persName>Sor- Dn Francisco</persName>&#8212; I thank him however for his compliments to
our <placeName>country </placeName>and sorry I am to say they are not deserved&#8212; 
Ambitious and bad <persName>men </persName>are exciting the <persName>people </persName>against the <persName>federal 
government</persName>&#8212; <persName>Calhoun</persName>, <persName>Hamilton</persName>, <persName>McDuffie </persName>and <persName>Hayne </persName>have driven
our <persName>countrymen </persName>stark mad and our once loyal and glorious little
<placeName>state </placeName>is about to disgrace herself and bring ruin upon her <persName>citizens</persName>&#8212;
We have used every exertion to check them in their mad career,
but in vain&#8212; They have gained almost all the elections and will
in all probability have a <persName>constitutional majority</persName> in favor of conven-<pb n="877"/>
tions&#8212; In this hope the <persName>Governor </persName>has called together the 
<persName>Legislature </persName>for <date when="1832-10-22">monday next</date>&#8212; The object is to call a convention of the
<persName>people </persName>and nullify the tariff act&#8212; If <persName>General Jackson</persName> is reelected
I have no fears of the result&#8212; He will I am sure act with vigour
and put down these <persName>nullifiers</persName>, forever&#8212; It is a hard case to stand
by and see our <placeName>city </placeName>ruined by these <persName>men</persName>, who are guided alone by
their personal ambition&#8212; We had a most animated contest and
the union party put itself under my guidance, but it had been so
mismanaged, that I could not restore it to order in the short time
I had the command&#8212;not three weeks, We will do better in 
another year if the contest is not decided by the Sword before that
period&#8212;- In <placeName>every other part of the United States</placeName> there reigns the
most perfect tranquillity and unparallelled prosperity&#8212;Even here
if these <persName>agitators </persName>would let us alone, we are more prosperous than I
have ever known <placeName>Carolina </placeName>to be&#8212; I cannot think of them or write
of them with any patience&#8212; I will inform you soon of what our
assembly of wise <persName>men </persName>do at <placeName>Columbia</placeName>&#8212; I cannot doubt of <persName>Genl
Jackson</persName>'s reelection&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>J. R. Poinsett</persName></p>
