time is, and how anxious we all are for your Safe return <placeName>home</placeName>; it<pb n="504"/>
appears to me that you have been gone two or three months; I was
so a[n]xious for you to take the journey that you took in the <date n="Spring - 1830">Spring</date>,
that the time of your absence, I hardly regarded, but it is diferent
now, every day that you have been gone appears a week; and God
grant that you may be bless'd with a continuation of good health;
to innable you to return <placeName>to the bosom of your Family</placeName>; the <persName>Children</persName>
