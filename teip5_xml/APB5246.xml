<p><placeName>Hd. Qrs. Western Department</placeName></p>

<p><placeName>Camp Sabine</placeName>, <date when="1836-08-04">August 4 1836</date></p>

<p>Sir&#8212;</p>

<p>I received on the <date when="1836-07-27">27th </date>your letter of the <date when="1836-07-04">4th of July</date>, with the packet 
refered to addressed to the <persName>President of the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>, which I on the <date when="1836-07-30">30th
</date>forwarded by an <persName>Officer</persName>. Having reason to believe the <persName>President </persName>will be at
<placeName>Nashville Tenne</placeName>. in time to meet the packet at that place, the <persName>bearer </persName>of it
was directed to go thither,&#8212;where he will either find the <persName>President</persName>, or
learn where it is likely he may be met with, on his journey to <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>.
I am therefore in hopes I shall hear from him in relation to the 
arrangement proposed, sooner than a trip to <placeName>Washington </placeName>usually requires.</p>

<p>In reply to that part of your letter in which you speak of my 
guaranteeing in the name of the <placeName>united States</placeName> the fulfilment of a Treaty entered into
with the distinguished <persName>General Santa Anna</persName>, the <persName>President of Mexico</persName>, while
a <persName>prisoner of war</persName>, by the <persName>Government of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, I have to regret that I have
not in my present instructions from the <persName>President of the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName> 
sufficient authority to enable me to make such a guarantee.<pb n="411"/></p>

<p>Nevertheless should the <hi rend="italic"><persName>General in chief of the Mexican army</persName>, operating
</hi>or preparing to <hi rend="italic">operate against <placeName>Texas </placeName>unite with the <persName>President Santa Anna</persName>
</hi>in an arrangement with the high Civil and military authorities of Texas, the
<persName><placeName>United States</placeName> military commander</persName> here, viewing <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and <placeName>Texas </placeName>as
friendly neighboring powers, would, at their request, extend to the public
functionaries of both <persName>Governments</persName>, in the vicinity of this <placeName>frontier</placeName>, 
whatever acts of humanity, or courtecy, might be desired by them, consistently
with or not forbidden by the laws of <placeName>Nations</placeName>&#8212;or the Laws or Regulations
of the <placeName>united States</placeName>.</p>

<p>The present moment appears to be propitious for action towards the
attainment of a durable peace between the contending parties, and the 
arrangement suggested by you, if it can be made in accordance with the
views which I have just now expressed, may save an immense waste of
blood and treasure on both sides.&#8212; Whilst a continuance of war even
for a few months longer would lay the foundation for endless feuds and
bloody conflicts between the <hi rend="italic">civilized inhabitants of this section of 
<placeName>America</placeName></hi>&#8212;whose vital interests call aloud for <hi rend="italic">peace concord</hi>&#8212;and if possible a
close alliance, firm and durable as the Rocks which form the basis of our
greatest mountains!</p>

<p>Hoping to be able soon to address you more explicitly upon this 
subject, I am with great respect your most obdt. servt.</p>

<p><persName>Edmund P. Gaines</persName></p>

<p>To <persName>General S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Columbia, Texas</placeName>.</p>
