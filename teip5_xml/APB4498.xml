<p>Goliad Dec. 21&#8212; 1832</p>
<p>Col S. F. Austin</p>

<p><placeName>Sn. Felipe</placeName></p>

<p>Dr. Sir/My respects in reply to your esteemed favor of the <date when="1832-12-06">6th insi</date>
were addressed to you at <placeName>Bejar </placeName>on <date when="1832-12-17">monday last</date> by a private
conveyance</p>

<p>Nothing very material has occurred here&#8212;the Election for 
<persName>Municipal officers</persName> has resulted in <persName>Mr. Aldrete</persName>, a worthy and energetic man,
Alcalde&#8212;<persName>Jn. Anto Santos Regidor</persName>&#8212;and <persName>Nicholas Gal an Procurador</persName></p>

<p>The <persName>Chief of department</persName> remained here a few days and proceeded
to <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName>and thence to <placeName>La Vaca</placeName> where he is now said to be&#8212;
our <persName>friends </persName>here think he is not as warm in the cause as your letter
led us to anticipate&#8212; I endeavour to persuade them that he is,
but that he does not wish to appear too prominent at this particular
moment&#8212; that the affair may even appear to have originated in
and emanated from the <persName>Ayuntamto of <placeName>Bejar</placeName></persName> and not from him nor
with his official coadjutorship&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Alvan Wetherby</persName> will probably hand you this&#8212; He is the
Gentleman I mentioned to you when here&#8212; He visits your City
for the express purpose of obtaining land <placeName>in the litoral Leagues</placeName> and
becoming a <persName>colonist </persName>of yours&#8212;he is a person I much esteem&#8212;is a
<persName>Merchant</persName>&#8212;will take considerable property into your quarter and
in a word is an acquisition to your <placeName>community</placeName>&#8212;   I hope and trust<pb n="909"/>
you will grant him his request&#8212; As for myself I will say nothing&#8212;
I expressed to you when here my desires and intentions, and leave
the rest entirely to yourself confident that you will do or have already
done all the requisite and much more than if I were present</p>

<p>Your <persName>friends </persName>here all join in the warmest expressions of 
friendship and desire me to present their cordial Salutations</p>

<p><persName>Thomas G. Western</persName></p>

<p>A person just in from <placeName>Matams</placeName> reports that <persName>Moctezuma </persName>had 
defeated <persName>Bustamte </persName>at <placeName>Sn Luis Potosi</placeName>&#8212;</p>
