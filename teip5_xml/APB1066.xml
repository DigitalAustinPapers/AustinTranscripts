<p>Sir</p>

<p>By <persName>Mr. Wm Cummings</persName> I take the liberty of addressing you, tho:
a perfect <persName>stranger</persName>, this however I hope will not be considered 
intrusive, in as much as I am very desirous of leming the general
character of your <placeName>province</placeName>, as to general Laws and municipal 
regulations by profession I am a <persName>lawyer</persName>, and have been in the 
profession for upwards of twenty five years, and have connected with me a
<persName>Son in Law</persName> of the same profession, a young man of finished 
education, and in general opinion of much promise. I have also <persName>Nephew</persName>
a <persName>phisician</persName>, regularly bread, these <persName>gentlemen</persName> have strong 
inclination to settle in some New <placeName>Country</placeName>, opening to them, prospects, more
flattering to their views, than any thing in this section of the
<placeName>United States</placeName>. By <placeName>News paper </placeName>information we <hi rend="italic">here</hi> are informed,
that the Government of <placeName>Mexeco</placeName>, will be partially organized and
assimelated to the Government of these <placeName>United States</placeName> so far as
circumstances will permit, should your government, be organized
with a Judiciary likened to that of any [of] our states it is 
presumable some field would be opened for a young [man] of legal 
acquirements, of which you will be pleased to inform me.</p>

<p>It is not improbable but that upon satisfactory information, of
the character of your government, should it be as I have had reason
to calculate, I would with some few others become <persName>citizens</persName> thereof,
for myself I could not from age (fifty) expect much, but my 
object is the promotion of my <persName>connections</persName>, we could not bring much
wealth, with us, but I can say with some confidence, we could, bring
that, that would be no loss to your <placeName>infant establishment</placeName>, 
character etc.</p>

<p>At some leisure moment, will you be pleased to devote, a little
time in answering this letter, and have it, forwarded to some post
office in the<placeName> United States</placeName>,</p>

<p><persName>John S. Wills.</persName></p>
<p>NB I believe I knew your<persName> father</persName>, when he resided in <placeName>Richmond, 
Virginia</placeName> I was then studying Law in that place, I saw him afterwards
at <placeName>Cincennati Ohio</placeName>, on his way to the <placeName>lower Country</placeName></p>

<p><persName>J. S. W</persName>.</p>
<p><persName>Colo. Philip Austin</persName> <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>.</p>
