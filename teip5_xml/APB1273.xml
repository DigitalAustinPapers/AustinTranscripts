<p><persName>Austin Esqr</persName></p>

<p>Sir Having some days since had a conversation with your
<persName>Brother </persName>through the medium of a friend respecting the loss I 
sustained of a Cabalyard, consisting of 69 head of Mules 22 Horses and
13 work Oxen, taken off at night from my camp by the <persName>towagones
[Tahuacanos]</persName> and <persName>wecos</persName>&#8212;He informed me that an <persName>Expedition </persName>was
about being undertaken by the <persName>settlers </persName>of your <placeName>Colony </placeName>against those
two <persName>Nations </persName>for depredations committed upon your <placeName>settlement</placeName>&#8212;
and promised that he would write to you on the subject of my loss
and assured me of your friendly disposition toward the recovery of
my property, all which I doubt not he has mentioned to you, previous
to his leaving here, probably by the last mail that left here</p>

<p>Under the solicitude I feel for the recovery of this property, and
the Extra expense incurred added to the pecuniary embarrassment,
and my attention being required to my property here, preventing 
personal steps towards regaining of my cavalyard, I am induced 
personally to address this Letter, and in aid with a <persName>friend</persName>, who has<pb n="1450"/>
politely promised to forward the same further to solicit your good
offices, in the event of an <persName>Expedition </persName>being fitted out as suggested
by your <persName>Brother</persName>, towards the Expense of which I am willing most
chearfully to contribute Five Hundred Dollars, provided by so doing
my property could be placed in a situation so as to be obtained by
my sending for it on being advised thereof, beside placing myself
under obligations of gratitude and personal respect not to be forgotten, 
but holding myself always ready to reciprocate when 
opportunity presented, to yourself or friends.</p>

<p>Owing to my misfortune I have come to a determination to sell
off 4 to 6 waggons, of which I also apprized your <persName>Brother</persName>, who at
once discovered thire usefulness to some of the Largest <persName>Planters </persName>in
your <placeName>Neighbourhood</placeName>&#8212;they are large and heavy, with broad wheels,
well ironed and calculated either for Oxen or Mules, with complete
sets of Harness&#8212;should any be wanted I would suggest the 
propriety of an early application, as I feel disposed to let them go
reasonably, in order that my stay may not be protracted&#8212;Be pleased
to favor me with your reply by return post and oblige,</p>

<p><persName>Alex Curcier</persName></p>

<p>The mark of my Mules and Horses is <persName>A. C.</persName> on the <placeName>near side of
the neck and shoulders&#8212;</placeName></p>

<p>The oxen have no mark particularly remembered</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>S. F. Austin Esqr.</persName>
