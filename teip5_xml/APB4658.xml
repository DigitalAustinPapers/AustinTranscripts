<p><persName>Mr J F Perry</persName></p>

<p>My dear Sir My letters by the last arrival give me strong hopes
that <persName>Stephen </persName>will soon be with us&#8212;<persName>Mr Stone</persName> late consul from 
<placeName>Veracruz </placeName>whom I know writes to my friend and old <persName>copartner </persName>when in
<placeName>Veracruz </placeName>now <persName>consul in <placeName>New York</placeName></persName> that he pas'd a day with <persName>Santa
Ana</persName> before he left for <placeName>Mexico </placeName>that he spoke without reserve of
<placeName>Texas </placeName>and <persName>Col Austin</persName> said the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> had been shamefully
villifyd that he was certain they had no intention to revolt&#8212;that
<persName>Col Austin</persName> had been cruelly and maliciously treated, that he should
liberate him on his arrival and make him all the reperation in his
power&#8212;that he would see the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> protected in their
rights and property and much more to the same purpose,&#8212;</p>

<p>On the arrival of the June Packet the <persName>Mexican minister then at
<placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></persName> wrote to the<persName> Consul in <placeName>New York</placeName></persName> saying he was 
informed of the intention of the <persName>president </persName>to liberate <persName>Col A</persName> and
wished to know if he the <persName>consul </persName>had received by the packet any 
certain accounts of its having been carried into effect-&#8212;but the letter
by the packet from <persName>Dale Parrot &amp; Co</persName> were silent about him, altho
they had never failed to mention him in former letters, had any
evil befallen him it would certainly have been mentioned, the 
presumption is that he was free and off.</p>

<p>Great excitement existed in the<placeName> U S </placeName>on the subject, <persName>Meigs </persName>says
"Brother <persName>Forsyth of the Senate</persName> used all his influence to bring the
influence of the <persName>Govt </persName>to bear on the subject"&#8212;</p>

<p>I want much to come and see you and<persName> Cousin Emily</persName>, but my
<persName>daughter Hennrietta</persName> is sick and I ought to have been <placeName>home </placeName>today&#8212;
I shall move to <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Montpelier </placeName></hi>within a week if no new disaster occurs</p>

<p>My best regards to <persName>Emily</persName></p>

<p><persName>H Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. J F Perry</persName> <placeName>Peach Point</placeName></p>
