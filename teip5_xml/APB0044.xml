<p>Sir</p>

<p>That I might Deliver to you your Certificate of Survey you have
one Step more to take which is this as the <persName>Lieut Governor </persName>has told
the <persName>Commandant of <placeName>Ste. Genevieve</placeName></persName> that it was necessary that the
people who have any Interest in <placeName>Breton's mines</placeName> Should prove in
writing that your Concession in the way that it was previously
Survey'd was irreparably hurtful to them and as no sort of 
representation has been made on that head and as it is probable that the
mode is over It is necessary that you Should address yourself to
the <persName>Lieut Governor</persName> by Drawing a petition by which you will tell
him that you have Claim'd from me your Certificate of Survey
and that I having answered to you that it was out of my power to
Deliver it to you without a new written order from the Lieut 
Governor you require of him to give me Such order that having my
Certificate you might have recourse to a lawful authority to Get a
formal title of Concession</p>

<p>as Since the <persName>Lt Governor</persName>'s Letter to <persName>Mr. Franls Vallé</persName> no 
representation has been made against the Survey of your Land I have
not the least Doubt but your petition Will be Granted and [if in]
Virtue of your reclamation Such order Shall be Given to me 
Immediately I will make up and Send down to you your Certificate of
Survey after which you may act<pb n="57"/></p>

<p>I expect that in the Course of this month you will make up your
promise toward me <persName>Mr. Pascal</persName> has nothing to Do but to receive
present if you please my humble respects to <persName>Mrs. Austin</persName> and believe
me</p>

<p><persName>Antn Soulard</persName></p>
