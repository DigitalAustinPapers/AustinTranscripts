<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galve&amp;ton, Tex,]</p>

<p><placeName>Monterrey </placeName><date when="1834-01-12">Jany 12 1834</date></p>
<p><persName>S. M. Williams</persName>.</p>

<p>On my arrival at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>on the <date when="1834-01-03">3 inst</date>. I was arrested by the <persName>Comt
General</persName> on an order from the<persName> Minister of War</persName> directing that I
should be sent back to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>to answer an accusation, made, as
I understand, by the <persName>Govt, of the State of Coahuila and Texas.</persName> I
leave in a few days for <placeName>Mexico </placeName>under an <persName>escort </persName>as a <persName>prisoner</persName>. My
treatment is very good and I have no cause to complain on that
score. I feel under obligations to the <persName>Com Genl Don Pedro Lemus</persName>,
and to the <persName>Govr of this State Manual Maria Llanos</persName>, also to <persName>Col 
Ugartechea</persName> who is the <persName>Commandant </persName>at this place. They have all treated
me in the kindest manner. <persName>Lemus </persName>expects to visit <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and if he
should, and I have one <persName>friend </persName>left in that <placeName>country</placeName>, or if there be
one out of the thousands whose fortunes I have labored to make,
who wishes to do me a favor in return, I request that friend, or
that <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, to be the friend of <persName>Genl Lemus</persName> for my sake.</p>

<p>I presume that I am arrested for writing the <hi rend="italic">oficio </hi>to the <persName>Aytos.
of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> dated <date when="1833-10-02">2d of October last</date>. I made some <persName>enemies </persName>in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>for
opposing a <placeName>territory</placeName>, but I do not believe they have had any hand
in my arrest. It has been intimated to me that some <persName>enemy</persName>, I know
not who, had accused me of designs to unite <placeName>Texas </placeName>with the <placeName>U. S.
of the north</placeName>. Such an accusation is false and I disregard it. I
have said openly to all<persName> persons in <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName>, and to the <persName>Govt</persName>, itself,
that I was of opinion the <persName>local Govt, of <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>ought to be organized,
or that <placeName>country </placeName>ought to be transfered to the <placeName>U. S. </placeName>for situated
as it now is, it is liable to revolutions and anarchy which may do
much harm to the <placeName>frontiers of both nations</placeName>, and finally loose <placeName>Texas</placeName>
and ruin the poor and honest <persName>settlers </persName>who have labored in good faith
to redeem it from the <placeName>wilderness </placeName>and make it a <placeName>valuable portion
of the Mexican republic</placeName>. The real fact is that at this time <placeName>Texas</placeName>
does not belong to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, nor to <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>, nor to the <persName>settlers </persName>who
have redeemed it&#8212;it belongs to them in justice and in right that
is to the<placeName> Mexican republic</placeName> and to the <persName>inhabitants of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>&#8212;but in
point of fact, it belongs to <persName>demagogues</persName>, <persName>pettyfoggers</persName>, <persName>visionary
speculators</persName> and <persName>scheamers</persName>, to <persName>indians </persName>to anarchy and discord and
confusion&#8212;to comprehend all in one word&#8212;it is without 
<persName>Government</persName>.</p>

<p>I hope there will be no excitement about my arrest. All I can
be accused of is, that I have labored arduously, faithfully, and 
perhaps at particular moments, pationately, and with more impatience
and irritation than I ought to have shewn, to have <placeName>Texas </placeName>made
<placeName>State of the Mexican Confederation</placeName> separate from <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>.   This<pb n="1025"/>
is all, and this is no crime. But should it be considered otherwise,
it will not take me by surprise. Ever since I returned from <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
a year ago <date n="12-xx-1833">last Decr</date> and found the Convention called in my absence,
I have consider'd myself as suspended over the altar of sacrifice.
That measure placed me in an awkward position. It compromised
me in the highest degree with the <persName>people and authorities of <placeName>Bexar</placeName>,</persName>
on the one hand, and with my <persName>friends at <placeName>San Felipe</placeName></persName> on the other,
for altho I had agreed to the calling of a convention before I went
to <persName>Bexar</persName>, I did not expect it would have been done in my absence.
I went there to consult with the <persName>authorities </persName>of that place. I 
considered that very great respect and deference was justly due to them
as <persName>native Mexicans</persName>, as the <placeName>capital of Texas</placeName>, and as the <placeName>oldest and
most populous town in the country</placeName>. And I knew the importance
of getting them to take the lead in all the politics of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, besides
this, I was personally attached to those people as a sincere friend
and wished to act in concert with them. I wished the convention
to meet in <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, but at that time it was death to any man's 
popularity to speak in favor of the <persName>Mexicans</persName>. These things are all
pased and had best be forgotten&#8212;probably I have no just cause to
blame any one but myself for in some things that occured then I
was a mere <persName><hi rend="italic">passive actor</hi></persName>, when I ought to have been a firm and
unbending <persName><hi rend="italic">director</hi></persName>. My object was to smother the party spirit and
violent and ruinous divisions which I saw brewing in the <placeName>colony</placeName>;
and as my friendship for the <persName>Mexicans </persName>and opposition to violent
measures was to have been used by my <persName>enemies</persName>, (who were in fact
also the only real <persName>enemies </persName>to <placeName>Texas</placeName>) as the kindling materials, the
oil and brimstone to set the flame of discord and confusion ablazing,
I thought it best to deprive them of the kindling matter by a passive
course. I mistook the means, and committed a great error, but I
have learned this lesson in politics, that there is no medium with
envy and party spirit, between victory and defeat.</p>

<p>I was always in favor of the State question, but I feared, especially
after my trip to <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, that it would not succeed unless the <persName>people</persName>
of that place took the lead, and it was arranged for them to do so.
The representation and remonstrance of <date when="1833-12-19">19 Decr</date>, was the first step,
and would have led to all the others, and <placeName>Texas </placeName>by this time would
have been a State or nearly so, and the discord that I fear has
arisen between <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and a part of <placeName>Texas </placeName>would have been avoided.
All was defeated and deranged and <placeName>Bexar </placeName>was offended and turned
against a measure that it was in favor of. So much for party spirit
and envy, or rather for opposition to <persName>Austin </persName>because he was <persName>Austin</persName>&#8212;
he, must be suspected and watched&#8212;<hi rend="italic">he</hi>, who has labored so many
years regardless of personal fatigue or responsability to build up<pb n="1026"/>
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, settle it and make the fortunes of its <persName>inhabitants</persName>&#8212;bien, muy
bien. Such is human nature and such it will always be-&#8212;I am tired
of it and for the future wish to have as little to do with mankind or
their affairs as practicable.</p>

<p>If I thought my advice would have any weight, I would say to
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, you must all harmonise with <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and <placeName>Goliad</placeName>, that is with
the <persName>Mexican population</persName>. If they petition for a <placeName>State </placeName>or a <placeName>Territory</placeName>
and are seconded by the rest of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, the petition will be granted,
and I am equally certain that no petition of this kind will succeed
that is opposed by that population.</p>

<p>If a <persName>victim </persName>is required by the <persName>Govt </persName>I, of course will be the man,
for those who have really contributed to precipitate these matters
occupy too small a space to be noticed by the Government.</p>

<p>I wish you to send me a certified copy of the representation made
last year by the <persName>Ayto. of <placeName>Goliad</placeName></persName>. I have that of <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and need
the other to shew that the <persName>Mexican population</persName> complained even
more than the other. Send it under cover to<persName> W. S. Parrott</persName> and
direct all letters for me to him.</p>

<p>The <persName>Aytos. of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, if they wish to do me justice might state to
the <persName>Genl Govt</persName> what they know of my character and conduct. I do
not ask it, if it is done I wish it of their own accord. Such a thing
from <placeName>Bexar </placeName>would have weight. I must request you to provide me
with the means of living in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. I used one of the bills of credit
that is one thousand dollars&#8212;can I use the other? I can sell bills
on <placeName>Orleans </placeName>in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>for 10 pr. ct. I sold to <persName>Parrott</persName>&#8212;I recd, 
nothing for any of the claims on <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>but am promised something.
I presume I shall be five or six months and perhaps a year in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
or I may be sent back to the <persName>State Govt</persName> who have demanded me of
the <persName>Comt Genl</persName> for what purpose, whether friendly or hostile, I
know not. No man has benefited <placeName>this part of the nation</placeName> more than
I have&#8212;in a few years more the <placeName>frontier of Coahuila </placeName>will be safe
from the <persName>indians</persName></p>

<p>Remember me to my <persName>friends </persName>if I have any and to your <persName>wife </persName>and
the <persName>old settlers</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
