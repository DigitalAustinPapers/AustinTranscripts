<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1830-06-14">14 June 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>T. F. Leaming Esqr</persName>.</p>

<p>My dear Sir, It has been a long time since I had the pleasure of
hearing from you by letter. My <persName>brother in law James F. Perry</persName>
paid me a visit in<date n="04-xx-1830"> april last </date>and will remove his <persName>family </persName>to this <placeName>colony</placeName>
in the <date n="Fall - 1830">fall </date>he expects to visit <placeName>Phia </placeName>this <date n="Summer - 1830">summer </date>and will call on
you&#8212; I have as yet heard nothing of the <placeName>Map of Texas</placeName>, since I
forwarded it the surveys have been considerably extended and I
could now form a much more accurate map, tho the one I sent gives
a very correct general idea of the <placeName>country </placeName>and is fully as correct as
the first maps of new <placeName>countries </placeName>usually are and I think more so, it
cost me great labor and trouble and considerable expence&#8212; My
object was not individual profit, it was to bring this <placeName>country </placeName>
forward into public view, for it has been literaly buried in obscurity up
to the last year&#8212;</p>

<p>Respect for the opinions and last will of my <persName>father </persName>caused me to
explore <placeName>Texas </placeName>in <date n="xx-xx-1821">1821</date>. I was both delighted and astonished to find
it to be the <placeName>most favord region I had ever seen</placeName>.   Its fertility and<pb n="414"/>
natural resources, so far exceeding any thing I had imagined, 
determined me to devote my life to the great object of redeeming it from
the <placeName>wilderness</placeName>.</p>

<p>It was a heavy undertaking for a young, inexperianced <hi rend="italic">and very
poor man</hi>&#8212;My first step was to study the character of the <persName>Mexicans</persName>
and ascertain their ideas and views as to <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; I found they
knew nothing about it, and were profoundly ignorant of its real
value, and also that they considered it next to impracticable to form
a <placeName>settlement </placeName>in its <placeName>wilderness </placeName>without the aid of a very strong 
<persName>Military force</persName> for <placeName>garrisons </placeName>to keep the <persName>indians </persName>in check. I also 
discover that strong prejudices existed against the <persName>North Americans
</persName>owing to the conduct of some who were engaged in the <persName>revolutionary
expeditions</persName> that had entered <placeName>Texas </placeName>at various times since <date n="xx-xx-1811">1811</date>, I
saw that all the efforts to get foothold here by means of such 
<persName>expeditions </persName>had failed and ended in defeat and ruin, and I believed they
always would fail, These observations convinced me that the only
means of redeeming this <placeName>country </placeName>from the <placeName>wilderness </placeName>was by 
peaceful <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, noisless, perseverence and industry, and that the axe, the
plough and the hoe would do more than the rifle or the sword.
under these impressions I began and have pursued the main object
with a degree of patience and perseverence which nothing but its
vast importance to the<placeName> civilized world </placeName>could ever have given me
fortitude to continue through so many years of hardships and amidst
so many discouraging obstacles&#8212; The worst is now over and the
few clouds which seem to hang over us are mere shadows when 
compared with those which have passed. I have laid a sufficient 
foundation for others to build on, and a prudent course will make this
<placeName>country </placeName>one of the finest in the <placeName>world</placeName>.</p>

<p>The measures lately adopted by the <persName>Mexican Govt</persName>, prohibiting
the emigration of <persName>North Americans</persName>, affords a striking proof of the
nesesity of the <hi rend="italic">silent </hi>course which I have pursued in bringing 
forward this <placeName>settlement</placeName>. I have never sent any notices or publications
respecting it to be printed in the <placeName>news papers</placeName> untill lately, when I
first began in <date n="xx-xx-1821">1821 </date>merely put in a notice in the <placeName>Orleans papers </placeName>that
I was authorised to settle <persName>300 families</persName> and barely said enough to
draw a little attention, last year I found that the Govt, were 
begining to become suspicious that this <placeName>country </placeName>was of more value than
they had supposed it was, <persName>Genl Teran</persName> passed through here, and
saw it. I found that something must be done to draw emigration
and I determined to have the <placeName>Map </placeName>published as the Most effectual
means of operating on an intelligent <persName>people</persName>, and the least dangerous
with the <persName>Mexicans</persName>, for not many of them know any thing about <placeName>maps</placeName>
&#8212;unfortunately about this time "<hi rend="italic">Americanus</hi>" and other <placeName>publica-<pb n="415"/>
tions </placeName>appeared and <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Texas </placeName></hi>became A general topic of discussion in
the<placeName> U. S. papers </placeName>This roused the attention of the <persName>Mexican </persName>Govt,
and excited their jealoucy that the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> were determined to take
this <placeName>country </placeName>by force right or wrong, and this mistaken notion has
produced the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6 of April</date> last prohibiting emigration from the
<placeName>U. S. </placeName>and suspending all the contracts of colonization, except in the
<placeName>colonies that are " <hi rend="italic">established </hi>"</placeName>&#8212; this clause was crowded in by
my <persName>friends </persName>to cover this <placeName>colony </placeName>(for mine is the only one that is
established) and under it I shall be able with good management to
keep open the door for some time longer, and perhaps untill a new
order of things takes place,</p>

<p>I have had two difficult tasks to perform here, one to manage
the Govt, and the other to manage the <persName>settlers</persName>, of these, the latter
was by far the most difficult&#8212; I do say that the<persName> North Americans
</persName>are the most obstinate and difficult <persName>people </persName>to manage that live on
earth, tho I have had many "<persName> backwoods men</persName> " and " <persName>rough fellows</persName> "
to do with. <persName>Emigrants from europe</persName> are not prohibited, and I
sometimes think that <persName>Swiss </persName>and <persName>Germans </persName>will promote the 
prosperity of this <placeName>country </placeName>much more than <persName>North Americans</persName>&#8212; They
will introduce the culture of the vine, olive etc. they are industrious
and moral, they have not in general, that horrible <hi rend="italic">Mania </hi>for 
speculation which is so prominent a trait in the <persName>english </persName>and <persName>North
American</persName> character, <hi rend="italic">and above all they will oppose slavery</hi>&#8212; The
idea of seeing such a <placeName>country </placeName>as this overrun by a <persName>slave </persName>population
almost makes me weep&#8212; It is in vain to tell a <persName>North American</persName> that
the <persName>white population</persName> will be destroyed some fifty or eighty years
hence by the <persName>negros</persName>, and that his <persName>daughters </persName>will be violated and
<persName>Butch[er]ed</persName> by them&#8212; "it is too far off to think of&#8212;" "they can
do as I have, take care of themselves "&#8212;" something will turn up
to keep off the evil" etc, etc, such are the silly answers of the <persName>slave
holder</persName>&#8212;to say any thing to them as to the justice of slavery, or its
demoralizing effects on society, is only to draw down ridicule upon
the person who attempts it&#8212; In the begining of this <placeName>settlement</placeName>
I was compelled to hold out the idea that slavery would be tolerated,
and I succeeded in getting it <hi rend="italic">tolerated </hi>for a time by the Govt. I
did this to get a start for otherwise it would have been next to 
impossible to have started at all, for I had to draw on <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>and
<placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName>Slave States</placeName>, for the first <persName>emigrants</persName>&#8212; Slavery is now
most positively prohibited by our Constitution and by a number of
laws, and I do hope it may always be so.</p>

<p>I have passed a truly slavish life here for nine years, my 
constitution is much broken, my health bad, and my days are probably
drawing towards a close, but I can claim some credit for what has
been done towards laying a foundation for the formation of a rich
and I hope a happy <placeName>community</placeName>&#8212; <placeName>Texas </placeName>no longer belongs to the
<placeName>wilderness</placeName>&#8212;whether it will ultimately remain attached to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
or unite with <placeName>the north</placeName>, or form an <placeName>independent nation</placeName>, is all mere
matter of conjecture, If slavery is excluded, I think the latter the
most probable&#8212;but if it is admitted, <placeName>Texas </placeName>will become what all
<placeName>slave countries </placeName>are and of necessity must be destitute of physical force
and dependent on some other power even for the preservation of its
internal tranquility&#8212;in short it must have a <hi rend="italic">prop </hi>to lean upon, for
no <placeName>slave country </placeName>can stand alone&#8212;</p>

<p>I think that much good might be done by a series of publications in
the<placeName> National Gazette</placeName> on the emigration of <persName>Swiss </persName>and <persName>Germans </persName>to
<persName>Texas</persName>&#8212;also against the admission of Slavery here&#8212;against annexing
it to the <placeName>U. S.</placeName>&#8212;in favor of its adhering to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>as long as the
federal constitution stands <hi rend="italic">and no longer</hi>, but then to set up for
itself, under the protection of the <placeName>U. S</placeName>.&#8212; you will of course 
perceive that this letter is not <hi rend="italic">for the public eye</hi>&#8212; I have wished to
give <hi rend="italic">you </hi>as a relative, some idea of my labors and views here, they
are pure&#8212; I will die sooner than violate my duty to this 
government, and if it would let me work I would make <placeName>Texas </placeName>the best state
that belongs to this <placeName>nation</placeName>, but my dear sir the truth is that the
<persName>Mexicans </persName>cannot sustain a <placeName>republic</placeName>-&#8212; The present form must fall
and what is then to become of Texas ? we are too weak to set up for
ourselves, unless under the protection of our <persName>powerfall neighbor</persName>&#8212;
and the protection which the strong affords to the <hi rend="italic">weak </hi>is much to be
feared-&#8212; If we had population, our course would be a very plain
one, but we have it not&#8212; <placeName>Territory </placeName>we have to form a snug 
<persName>republic</persName>,&#8212; I am in hopes the federal system may stand a few years
longer and that by that time we shall get in some thousands of <persName>swiss</persName>,
<persName>Germans</persName>, etc, and <persName>North Americans</persName>&#8212;the emigration is still 
uninterupted to my <placeName>colony </placeName>and there will be a great accession of strength<date n="Fall - 1830">
this fall&#8212;</date></p>

<p><persName>S. Rhoads Fisher</persName> of your city has paid us a visit and can give
you much information as to this <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;-</p>

<p>I sent you a <placeName>pamphlet </placeName>sometime since containing translations of
the laws of colonization etc&#8212;if you have not recd it you can get
one from <persName>John P Austin</persName>, <persName>(Austin and Tayleur)</persName> <placeName>New York</placeName>, or from
<persName>Arch. Austin</persName> same place&#8212;you will see by the law that what I stated
to you relative to the impositions attempted by <persName>D. A. Smith,</persName> <persName>Stephen
Wilson </persName>etc was correct&#8212;the publications of those men had its effect
in producing the law of<date when="1830-04-06"> 6 of April</date> last. Had all other <persName>impresarios</persName>
gone to work in good faith as I did, <placeName>Texas </placeName>would now have had a
very heavy population, but I am the only one out of near 80 who
engaged to settle <placeName>colonies </placeName>who has done any thing, <hi rend="italic">except harm</hi><pb n="417"/>
they have not brought one <persName>family </persName>to the <placeName>country</placeName>, nor advanced one
step.</p>

<p>I have but little knowledge of my <persName>mothers family</persName> I idolised
my beloved <persName>Mother </persName>and altho I know none of her <persName><placeName>Philadelphia </placeName>family</persName>
connections personally I have towards them all the affection of a
relative&#8212; Will you do me the kindness to send me by<persName> Mr. Perry</persName>
a short historical sketch of my <persName>mothers </persName>parentage and <persName>family </persName>and
of my <persName>maternal relations</persName> who are alive, where they live, their names
etc I have a great desire to visit the <placeName>U. S. </placeName>and I have no doubt it
would restore my health, but I am tied down here now, by many
heavy and perplexing duties, and to tell the truth I am too poor as
to <hi rend="italic">money</hi>) to bear the expence&#8212; I have land but it will not sell
yet&#8212;notwithstanding, I do not dispair of seeing <placeName>Philadelphia </placeName>before
I die&#8212;.</p>

<p>I think I was called after <persName>Benjamin Fuller </persName>who married a <persName>sister
of my mothers</persName>,&#8212; who inherited his fortune? he promised my
<persName>mother </persName>to leave it to me&#8212; If I had it now I would make <placeName>Texas</placeName>
much the better by it&#8212;</p>

<p>I hope <persName>Tanner </persName>may make a fortune out of the <placeName>map</placeName>, if so, he
must send me one [of] his best bound general Atlasses&#8212;</p>

<p>you may have some curiosity to know my age,   I was born in
<placeName>Wythe county Virginia </placeName><date when="1793-11-03">November 3. 1793</date>&#8212;</p>
<p>very cordially your frend and relation</p>

<p>I regret to say that <persName>James Austina son of Aunt Margarette</persName>  died
of consumption here a short time after his arrival from <placeName>Missouri</placeName>,
he was nearly gone when he reached here&#8212;</p>
