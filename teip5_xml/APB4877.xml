<p>CIRCULAR from the <persName>committee of safety of the <placeName>Jurisdiction of Austin</placeName></persName></p>

<p>Information of the most important and decisive character has just been
received from <placeName>Bexar </placeName>from unquestionable authority which in the opinion
of this <persName>committee </persName>calls for the prompt attention of the <persName>people</persName>.</p>

<p>The substance of this information is that <persName>Genl. Cos</persName> was expected at <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
on the <date when="1835-09-16">16th of this month</date> with more <persName>troops</persName>, that he intended to make an
immediate attack on the <placeName>colonies</placeName>, that there was a plan to try and foment
divisions and discord among the <persName>people</persName>, so as to use one part against the
other, and prevent preparation&#8212;and that the real object is to destroy and<pb n="129"/>
break up the<placeName> foreign settlements</placeName> in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; This <persName>committee </persName>have no doubt
of the correctness of this information and therefore recommend&#8212;</p>

<p>That the <persName>people </persName>should maintain the position taken by them at their
primary meetings&#8212; to insist on their rights under the federal Constitution
of <date n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date>and law of <date when="1824-05-07">7th May of that year</date> and union with the <placeName>Mexican
Confederation</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>That <placeName>every district</placeName> ought to organize its <persName>militia </persName>where it is not already
done, and have frequent musters, and that the <persName>Captains of Companies</persName> make
a return without delay to the <persName>political Chief of this Department</persName> of the force
of his <persName>Company </persName>the arms and amunition, in order that he may lay the same
before the <persName>general consultation of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>&#8212; <persName>Volunteer Companies</persName> are also
rec ommended&#8212;</p>

<p>This <persName>Committe </persName>deems it to be a duty to say that in its opinion all kind
of conciliatory measures with <persName>Genl. Cos</persName> and the <persName>military at <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> are 
hopeless, and that nothing but <hi rend="italic">ruin </hi>to <placeName>Texas </placeName>can be expected from any such
measures&#8212; They have already and very properly been resorted to without
effect.</p>

<p>WAR is our only resource&#8212;there is no other remedy but to defend our
rights, our <placeName>country </placeName>and <persName>ourselves </persName>by force of arms&#8212; To do this we must
be united, and in order to unite, the <persName>delegates of the people</persName> must meet in
general consultation and organize a system of defense and give organization
to the <placeName>country </placeName>so as to produce concert&#8212;</p>

<p>UNTILL some <persName>competent authority</persName> is established to <hi rend="italic">direct </hi>all that can be
done is to recommend this <persName>Committee </persName>therefore earnestly recommends
this subject and advises <persName>every man in <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> to prepare for war and lay
aside all hopes of conciliation.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin chairman of the Comm.</persName> [Rubric]</p>
