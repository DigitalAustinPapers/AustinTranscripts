<p>Sometime since, two settlers of this <placeName>Colony </placeName>were hunting deer near
the <placeName>mouth of the Colorado on the East bank</placeName>, when a party of 
<persName>Karankawase Indians</persName> rushed out of a grove in which they were concealed,
and followed them at full speed with their arms in readiness, and
other hostile demonstrations. The two <persName>settlers </persName>withdrew, and after
having joined with others, returned to look for those <persName>Indians</persName>, to
know if they were still hostile like last year, The <persName>Spies </persName>who took
the advance found an <placeName>Indian Camp</placeName>, but found in it only one man
and a <persName>woman</persName>. They called the <persName>Indian </persName>with friendly 
demonstrations, but he assumed a hostile attitude, preparing his arms, upon
which one of the <persName>Spies </persName>shot his rifle at him and wounded him; The
<persName>Indian </persName>and the <persName>woman </persName>escaped to the woods. It is not known
whether the <persName>Indian </persName>died, but the signs of blood showed that he was
badly wounded They found in the <placeName>Camp </placeName>several articles stolen at
the <placeName>mouth of the Colorado</placeName>, last year, when these <persName>Indians </persName>killed
the <persName>inhabitants</persName>, and destroyed the <placeName>settlement </placeName>at that point, I have
sent word to the <persName>Chief of the Karankawases</persName>, not to allow his men
to go to the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>and <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, until they make peace with the
<persName>people of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> and advised him to withdraw with his whole
nation to the <placeName>Mission at Refugio</placeName>, because if they show themselves
here, the <persName>Colonists </persName>will avenge the death of their <persName>friends </persName>killed by
these <persName>Indians </persName>on the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>. Which disposition I report to you,
hoping that it will meet your Superior approbation.</p>
