<p>Dear <persName>Henry</persName>&#8212;<persName>Mr Ware</persName> is not in the <placeName>city</placeName>&#8212;he is some where in the <placeName>state
of Mississippi</placeName>&#8212; I will leave your letter for him with <persName>Mr A. Hodge 
president of the <placeName>Orleans Bank</placeName></persName>&#8212; There is great enthusiasm in favor of <placeName>Texas </placeName>in
this <placeName>city</placeName>, and <placeName>all over the U. S</placeName>.&#8212;a thousand fold more than I had any idea
of&#8212; The universal opinion seems to be that, we ought to declare 
Independence <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>&#8212;it will give us the aid of <persName>men of capital and high
standing and character</persName> who wish for a more extensive field, than a mere
party war in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; My own feelings and impulses inclined me to this
course long ago and especially when I left <placeName>San Felipe</placeName>&#8212; What I said to
the <persName>provisional Govt</persName>, on the <date when="1835-11-30">30th. November</date> and <date when="1835-12-02">2d December</date> indicates
my feelings plain enough&#8212; It was unfortunate that I came on by water&#8212;
I should have arrived sooner by land, and I could not have gone to the
<placeName>lower country</placeName>, where the warm and even violent feelings of some of my
<persName>friends </persName>did at that time to a certain extent prcipitate me into party 
<hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>&#8212;a thing I have always tryed to avoid&#8212;</p>

<p>I am now acting and in future shall act on my own impulses, for I have
generally found them to be correct&#8212; <hi rend="italic">I go for Independence</hi> for I have no
doubt we shall get aid, as much as we need and perhaps more&#8212;and what
is of equal importance&#8212;the information from <placeName>Mexico </placeName>up to late in 
<date n="12-xx-1835">December </date>says that the <persName>Federal party</persName> has united with <persName>Santa Anna</persName> against us,
owing to what has already been said and done in <placeName>Texas </placeName>in favor of 
Independence so that our present position under the constitution of <date n="xx-xx-1834">1824</date>, does
us no good with the <persName>Federalists</persName>, and is doing us harm in this <placeName>country</placeName>, by
keeping away the kind of men we most need&#8212; were I in the <placeName>convention </placeName>I
would urge an immediate declaration of Independence&#8212;unless there should
be some news from the <placeName>interior </placeName>that changed the face of things&#8212;and even
then, it would require very strong reasons to prevent me from the course I<pb n="298"/>
now recommend&#8212; I wish you to inform <persName>McKinny </persName>and <persName>Jack </persName>etc of the 
contents of this letter&#8212;that is of such parts of it as you think proper&#8212;and I
advise you to take an open and bold stand for Independence at once&#8212; I
hope all my <persName>friends </persName>will do the same&#8212;and that the Question will be 
decided <hi rend="italic">unanimously</hi>&#8212; as I before observed I am informed that the <persName>Federal
Party</persName> have done nothing for us&#8212;and will do nothing&#8212;if so it is a folly to
maintain our present position any longer&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
