<p><placeName>Victoria </placeName><date when="1836-09-02">Sepr. 2. 1836</date></p>

<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>I am still here. <persName>Archer </persName>is on the mend and I think will be able to travel
in a few days in a wagon down to the landing where he can embark&#8212; I
shall then proceed home&#8212; My own health is not very good, tho I have no
severe attack of fever</p>

<p>I wrote you the other day, requesting that you would put up a <placeName>cabbin</placeName>
with two rooms for me, or if lumber and <persName>workmen </persName>can be had, a frame&#8212;
the <placeName>log house</placeName> perhaps will be the easiest, and quickest&#8212; I need one room
for an office or sitting room, and one for a sleeping room&#8212;</p>

<p>I must make your house my <placeName>home </placeName>for a time say untill <date n="Spring-1837">spring </date>at least,
and wish to devote the <date n="WInter-1836">winter </date>to closing and arranging all my business&#8212;
I must have one <persName>clerk </persName>at least, and perhaps two and there ought to be three
rooms, one for a sleeping room for the <persName>clerks </persName>and <persName>visitors</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I also wish you to make out an order on <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> for the necessary
mattresses, chairs, tables etc unless they can be had without sending there
I can sell some land and have the money ready for these purposes and
for all the necessary supplies of provisions etc. The sooner you can get
<persName>workmen </persName>and put up the <placeName>cabbin </placeName>etc the better&#8212; it must have a shingle
roof with extended eves so as [to] keep the wet from driving in etc&#8212; I
wish to get <persName>Joseph Baker</persName> to assist in closing the land business</p>

<p>These arrangements are made on the supposition that I shall not be
elected&#8212; <persName>Houston </persName>will, I am told, get all the <placeName>east</placeName>, and <placeName>Red river</placeName> now&#8212;
Many of the <persName>old settlers</persName> who are too blind to see or understand their 
interest will vote for him, and the army I believe will go for him, at least a
majority of them&#8212; So that I have a good prospect of some rest this year,
and time to regulate my private affairs, which need regulating very much.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName> <placeName>Peach point below Brazoria</placeName>
<persName>Col. Le Grand</persName></p>
