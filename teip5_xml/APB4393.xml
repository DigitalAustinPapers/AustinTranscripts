<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1832-07-28">July 28th 1832</date></p>
<p>Most esteemed chief and friend</p>

<p>I suppose that you have received the few lines that I wrote to you
hurriedly from <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>. In that letter I manifested the opinion
that under the actual circumstances it was very important for us
all to join the plan of <persName>Santa Anna</persName>: I will in this letter explain that
idea, and expose the reasons on which I ground it. In the first
place, in regard to this <placeName>Colony</placeName>. On my arrival at <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, I met
the whole <persName>people </persName>unanimous and enthusiastic in favor of the plan
of <persName>Santa Anna</persName>. They welcomed <persName>General Mejia</persName> with such rejoicing
and enthusiasm as I had never witnessed in this <placeName>country</placeName>. On the
day before in a large meeting they had resolved to persevere in their
adhesion to the plan of <placeName>Veracruz</placeName>, and that previous to having heard
of the arrival of <persName>Mejia</persName>. Under such circumstances, and observing
that the personal feelings against the <persName>inhabitants </persName>who had not given
their adhesion, and more particularly against the <persName>Ayuntamiento</persName>
were rather violent, and even gave rise to strong excitement against
some <persName>individuals</persName>; considering also the situation in which the <placeName>colony</placeName>
would be in regard to the division command by Col. Mejia if they
did not pronounce themselves; and finally taking into consideration
that the <persName>party of Santa Anna</persName> is truly the <persName>liberal republican</persName>, and
<persName>constitutional party</persName>, and that it is proper that a strong manifesta-<pb n="826"/>
tion of opinion should be made throughout the <placeName>Republic </placeName>in favor
of the plan of <placeName>Veracruz</placeName>, as the only means to bring civil war to an
end, and to secure peace and the constitutional liberty of the 
<placeName>Nation</placeName>. I expressed my opinion to the <persName>Ayuntamiento</persName>, advising them
to pronounce themselves in order to avoid evils and local 
misunderstandings which prove always fatal. A meeting of the 
<persName>Ayuntamiento </persName>took place the <date n="7-26-1832">day before yesterday</date>, and another <date n="7-27-1832">yesterday</date>,
of the <persName>people</persName>, which was well attended, and in which the plan of
<placeName>Veracruz </placeName>was unanimously adhered to, the most perfect unison and
harmony prevailing in that expression of the public will. The 
resolutions and their preamble contain a true manifestation of the
causes and origin of the difficulties at <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>, and of the objects
of those who went to attack <persName>Bradburn</persName>, in short they offer a 
concise history of the whole transaction. It was said by the <persName>partizans</persName>
of the <persName>Cabinet at <placeName>Matamoras</placeName></persName>, that the <persName>colonists </persName>had risen against
the integrity of the <placeName>territory</placeName>, and a thousand other false and
imaginary versions.</p>

<p>You may in your visit here have formed a correct idea of the
whole affair, and I am convinced that there was no other object
in view, but to show to the despot<persName> John Davis Bradburn</persName>, that
there is such a thing as the constitution and <placeName>State of Coahuila and
Texas</placeName>. That man was the cause of the whole evil, loss of life, and
misfortune. I assure you most solemnly, that I have not heard,
even from the mouth of the most exasperated, one word against
any <persName>Mexican </persName>holding an important command, or in office in these
<placeName>colonies</placeName>: The complaints are against <persName>Davis </persName>and <persName>Fisher</persName>, and most
particularly against the despotic procedings of the first, always
supported by <persName>General Teran</persName>. <persName>Fisher </persName>told me at <placeName>Matamoras</placeName>, that
the untimely, impolitic, and impracticable order issued by him on
the <date when="1831-11-24">24th of November last</date>, in relation to the Navigation of the
<placeName>Brazos River</placeName> was dictated by <persName>General Teran</persName> himself, and cannot
be charged to him, as he did but obey: In such case he has been
very unfortunate, because the whole odium fell on his head. I
assure you also, with the same solemnity, that I have not heard
one single word, that might countenance insinuations, often made
by <persName>friends </persName>of the <persName>Cabinet </persName>and <persName>enemies </persName>of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, that the <persName>colonists</persName>
wished to secede and to declare their independence from the 
<placeName>Mexican Federation</placeName>. On the contrary, the most intelligent among them,
told me that the late difficulties have convinced them more than
ever, that to think of such a thing would be the ruin of all. My
own and the general wish is, to see <placeName>Texas </placeName>forming by itself a <placeName>State
of the Federation</placeName>, and as long as it is not so, we can expect no
peace, progress nor government, and in fact nothing.<pb n="827"/></p>

<p>In answer to the question, what are the causes of the 
convulsions in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and why did they declare themselves in favor of
the plan of <placeName>Veracruz</placeName>, You may say; that in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, there is a 
<persName>military government</persName>, more or less despotic according to the character
and disposition of the<persName> commanding officers</persName>: that there is a <persName>civil
government</persName> more or less strong, according to the disposition and
intelligence of the <persName>Alcaldes</persName>, and <persName>Ayuntamientos</persName>, and their distance
from a <placeName>military post</placeName>, and thus there is no government at all in
several points, excepting that which originates in a mutual 
agreement on the part of the people to submit to the decisions of some
persons elected by them: But at the same time, all acknowledge
the authority and laws of the <placeName>Nation </placeName>and <placeName>State</placeName>: There is not
throughout <placeName>Texas</placeName>, one single "<persName>Juez de Letras,</persName>" nor one 
"<persName>Licenciado</persName>." The <persName>supreme tribunal of Justice</persName> is at <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, a distance
of 300 leagues. The <persName>legislature </persName>understands neither the situation
nor the wants of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, nor can it understand them. The <persName>military
powers</persName> under the anti-republican anti-liberal administration of
<persName>Guerrero's assassins</persName> who have extended their iron sceptre over the
<placeName>nation</placeName>, since the <persName><hi rend="italic">black cloud of </hi>Jalapa</persName> appeared, have treated the
government and constitution of the <placeName>State of Coahuila and Texas
</placeName>with a complete contempt. If the <persName>authorities </persName>of the <placeName>State </placeName>have
borne such insults, there is no reason why the people should do so.
In short, you may say that <placeName>Texas </placeName>needs a <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, and that
the best she can have, is to be created a <placeName>State </placeName>in the <placeName>Mexican 
Federation</placeName>. For which we want more population, and to obtain it,
the Article 11th of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">April 6th 1830</date> must be abrogated.</p>

<p>The <persName>inhabitants </persName>of <placeName>Texas </placeName>have always had their eyes and hopes
fixed on the <persName>authority </persName>and <persName>Ayuntamiento of the Capital of <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName>,
they with that City, would take the lead in advocating and defending
the interests and rights of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. It is the <placeName>oldest settlement</placeName>: the
<persName>fathers </persName>and <persName>forefathers </persName>of its <persName>inhabitants</persName>, have conquered the 
<placeName>wilderness </placeName>and struggled against the <persName>Indians</persName>. In the years <date n="xx-xx-1820">1820</date>-<date n="xx-xx-1821">1821</date>-<date n="xx-xx-1822">1822</date>
and <date n="xx-xx-1823">1823</date>, they were reduced to almost the last stage of decline and
suffering, and the whole of <placeName>Texas </placeName>was in danger of returning to its
primitive state, to be untrodden by <persName>civilized people</persName>. The 
<persName>immigrants </persName>did not, and do not believe that <placeName>Bexar </placeName>would shut its eyes
to the evils that affect the <placeName>Country</placeName>, or would remain contented and
silent, without even representing against the measures that prevent
emigration, and paralyze the progress of the <placeName>land of their <persName>ancestors</persName>.</placeName>
It is now time for it to meet the expectation of the people. <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
must speak in a respectful, but firm and decided tone and voice,
fearless of commanding <persName>generals</persName>, bayonets, <persName>ministers</persName>, or any body.
Let it adhere to the pronounciamento of <placeName>Veracruz</placeName>, urge the whole
of <placeName>Texas </placeName>to do the same, and thus unite us under the flag of the<pb n="828"/>
Constitution. Let it represent against the laws preventing 
imigration from other <placeName>countries</placeName>, request that the above be flung open to
all <placeName>nations </placeName>at peace with the <placeName>Republic</placeName>. Let it complain of the
maratime tariff, a barbarous contrivance ruinous to agriculture; let
it expose clearly the abuses of the <persName>military power</persName>, and above all, let
it be the first to urge a separation from <placeName>Coahuila </placeName>and the formation
of a <placeName>seperate State</placeName>. The character of the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>is 
interprizing and decided, they scorn dangers and laugh at obstacles;
therefore if <placeName>Bexar </placeName>wishes to be at the head of these people, it must
be decided in its course, it must be <placeName><hi rend="italic">Mexico-Texan</hi></placeName>.</p>

<p>If <placeName>Bexar </placeName>will pronounce itself, <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>will follow, but 
otherwise the people of that district will do what they have done here;
they will attack <persName>Colonel Piedras</persName>, and the whole population will be
up again, and <placeName>Mexico </placeName>overflowed with rumors and lies about the
<hi rend="italic">rebellion of the <persName>colonists</persName></hi> of Texas: All this may be avoided if <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
follows the example given by this town and <placeName>LaBahia</placeName> Things have
now come to such a pass, that lukewarm measures are ruinous, it
is necessary to adopt a <persName>party</persName>, and to declare it publicly, otherwise I
apprehend that it would be difficult to avoid difficulties, divisions,
and local ill feeling throughout <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Señor Mejia</persName> left the<placeName> mouth of the Brazos </placeName>for <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>, and may
thence proceed to <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, in which case, the people will join
him in mass. All this may be avoided if <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>
pronounce themselves, and the whole of <placeName>Texas </placeName>unites in mass under
the same banner&#8212;that of <persName>Santa Anna</persName>. I have expressed my opinion
to the<persName> government of the Nation</persName> and that of the <placeName>State</placeName>, as well as
to <persName>General Santa Anna </persName>from <placeName>Matamoras</placeName>, with a particular notice
of the slanderous, unjust and Machiavellian lie, of that imaginary
ghost raised by the <persName>aristocratic and designing enemies</persName> of the 
immigration of <persName>republican settlers</persName>&#8212;that the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of <placeName>Texas </placeName>wish
to secede from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. I have also declared that it is impossible
to rule <placeName>Texas</placeName>, militarily, and that its peace would be endangered
in proportion to the increase of regular <persName>troops</persName>, above the sufficient
number for the protection of the <persName>frontier </persName>from the <persName>Indians</persName>. Some
<persName>friends of the liberal party</persName>, asked me at <placeName>Monterey</placeName>: What are the
<persName>Ayuntamiento </persName>and <persName>People of <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> about that they do not manifest
to the <placeName>nation</placeName>, the true state of affairs in <placeName>Texas</placeName>? Why do they not
represent against article 11th of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">April 6, 1830</date>, which
opposes so many obstacles to emigration? I write to you with my
accustomed candor, and with the most sincere wishes for the 
prosperity and peace of my <placeName>country</placeName>, and in these terms I avail myself
of this occasion to give you the assurance of the respect and cordial
friendship of your fellow citizen and friend &amp;c.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
