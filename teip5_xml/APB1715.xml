<p><placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> <date n="0-04-1829">4 May 1829</date></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I have for several days anticipated the present opportunity with
a full intention of writing copiously to my <placeName>Texas </placeName><persName>friends</persName>&#8212; but the
person by whom I send to <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>sets out in the <date when="1829-05-05">morning</date>
Some days earlier than he expected when I last saw him&#8212;   My time<pb n="214"/>
is so short (for it is now 10 ociock p. m.) that I should let the 
conveyance pass by altogether were it not for my desire to transmit
to you the inclosed very <hi rend="italic">queer </hi>document&#8212;The <persName>author </persName>with whose
character I presume you are familiar? is now here-&#8212;he has Called on
me twice and seems to be deeply interested in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and perfectly
confident of the practicability of his Utopian <hi rend="italic">Social System</hi>, and its
peculiar adaptation to the condition or rather the "circumstances"
of our beautiful <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212; He appears to be influenced by a sincere
benevolence&#8212;but while I am willing to beleive he is an honest
<persName>philanthropist</persName>, I am constrained to think him a misguided and
infatuated visionary&#8212; He leaves here in a few days for <placeName>England</placeName>,
goes from thence to <placeName>Colombia</placeName>, to enlighten the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Liberator </persName></hi>and from
thence he returns to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>to compleat his arrangements with that
<persName>Government</persName>, and when <hi rend="italic">that shall be accomplished</hi>, he proposes
to pass over land to <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Genl Wavill</persName> with his <persName>family </persName>has been here about <date when="1829-04-21">two weeks</date>&#8212;
his <persName>wife</persName>, a very amiable <persName>English Lady</persName> presented him with a fine
little <persName>daughter </persName><date when="1829-04-28">this day a week ago.</date> He will leave in <date when="1829-05-14">about 10 days</date>
and after visiting some of the <placeName>eastern cities</placeName> will proceed to <placeName>England</placeName>
where he expects to remain some time&#8212; I have found him an
intelligent gentlemanly man&#8212; I expect <persName>Milam </persName>here in a few days
and as I am informed, it is probable <hi rend="italic"><persName>Peck </persName></hi>will be with him&#8212;we shall
have quite a coterie of <persName>Coahuilatexanos</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have no news of any peculiar interest. If I can have time in
the morning I'll put [up] a packet of papers for you. I regret very
much being so taken by surprise on this occassion but when I 
recollect that no one in <placeName>Texas </placeName>has thought it worth while to write to me,
it seems as if I might be compromitting myself by multiplying my
unreciprocated communications&#8212; I have sent many letters and
many <placeName>newspapers</placeName> since the waters rose and have not received an
acknowledgment of either&#8212;but I will not do so much discredit to
the frankness of others as to believe that any other motive will be
attributed to me than the true one, a desire to confer gratification
on those whom I esteem&#8212; Remember me very affectionately to all
friends <persName>Williams</persName>, <persName>Brown</persName>, <persName>League</persName>, <persName>Nuckols </persName>etc etc and to <persName>Mrs Long</persName>
and the <persName>Ladies </persName>generally&#8212;</p>

<p>May God bless and preserve and prosper you&#8212;</p>
<p><persName>David G Burnet </persName>   [Rubric]</p>
