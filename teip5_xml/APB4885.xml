<p><placeName>Committee Room San Augustine</placeName>&#8212;</p>
<p><date when="1835-09-22">September 22 1835</date></p>

<p>We the undersigned a <persName>Committee of Vigilence and correspondence</persName> 
appointed at, a large and general meeting of the <persName>citizens of the municipality
of <placeName>San Augustine</placeName></persName> convened at this place on the <date when="1835-09-07">7th inst.</date> the resolutions of
which, this <persName>committee </persName>transmitted you through <persName>Maj. Wade Bynum</persName> and
<persName>W. H. Wharton Esqr</persName> from the <placeName>jurisdiction of Austin</placeName>, have the honour of
addressing you in reply to your communication, this day received by us
dated, "<placeName>Committee Room, San Felipe</placeName>, <date when="1835-09-13">Sept. 13, 1835</date>&#8212;</p>

<p>This <persName>Committee </persName>deem that the propriety of a <persName>State Consultation</persName> has
already been unanimously acknowledged by the <persName>Citizens of this 
<placeName>municipality</placeName></persName> as indispensibly necessary for their well being and safety, to meet
in the <placeName>Town of Washington</placeName> on the <date when="1835-08-15">15th day of October next</date>, whose 
<persName>delegates</persName>, seven in number, are to be vested with unlimited powers, to be 
governed entirely by circumstances that may have transpired, up to the time
of the meeting of said consultation, owing to our detached local situations,
and the danger of protracting time, and deeming it highly necessary, at
this <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi>, to act with energy and decision&#8212;</p>

<p>This <persName>committee </persName>deem it impolitick to limit the capasity of their <persName>delegates</persName>
their interests being inseperably identified with their <persName>constituants</persName>, and in
common with the balance of the <persName>citizens of the <placeName>state</placeName></persName>, they knowing the
wants, and agrievances of the <persName>people</persName>, having minds unbiased, with an eye
single to good sound republican principles, will be willing to do what is
<hi rend="italic">right</hi>, and submit to <hi rend="italic">nothing </hi>that is wrong, are willing to risk our <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, to the mature and deliberate discussion and the final result of an unprejudiced
decision of a <persName>majority of the members of said consultation</persName> in determining
the course most advisable to be persued.</p>

<p>This <persName>Committee </persName>being well aware of the vital importance of securing
the friendship of the numerious <persName>Tribes of Indians</persName> intersperced among our
<persName>inhabitants</persName>, will take all necessary measures in their power for the 
accomplishment of that end&#8212;</p>

<p>This <persName>Committee </persName>are decidedly of opinion that the meeting for the 
proposed consultation, should be held at <placeName>Washingon</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">that </hi>place being first
designated, and generally understood, as being the place, considering the
objections to its being held at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, more easily obviated, than the
prejudices that might arise in the minds of many, on its being altered to
<placeName>San Felipe</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>This <persName>committee </persName>have ere this communicated with the <persName>people of <placeName>Red
River</placeName></persName> <placeName>about Pecan Point country</placeName>, presuming however that they will not act
at all on this subject.&#8212;<pb n="135"/></p>

<p>This <persName>Committee </persName>will, in compliance&#8212; with your final recommendation,
see that their <persName>delegates </persName>are furnished with all the statistical information,
practicable to be obtained&#8212;</p>

<p>Respy Your fellow Citizens&#8212;</p>
<p><persName>Philip A Sublett</persName></p>
<p><persName>Wm Inglish</persName></p>
<p><persName>Albert G Kellogg</persName></p>
<p><persName>Wm. Garrett</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>To <persName>W. Martin</persName>,<persName> S. F. Austin </persName>and others, <persName>committee of vigilence and safety
for the <placeName>jurisdiction of Austin</placeName></persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] To the <persName>Committee of Safety and Correspondence for the
<placeName>jurisdiction of Austin&#8212; San Felipe Texas</placeName></persName>&#8212;</p>
