<p><placeName>Washington </placeName><date when="1814-11-18">Novr 18th 1814</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am anxious to obtain and as soon as possible all the information
which can be had in relation to the <placeName>lead mines</placeName>&#8212;and I know of no
person better able to give correct information on the subject [than]
yourself&#8212;any ideas you may think proper to communicate as to the
manner of leasing the <placeName>public mineral lands</placeName> will be very acceptable
to me&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish to be informed as to the present prices given for mineral&#8212;
the profits to be derived from smelting&#8212;the probable revenue to be
derived to the <placeName>United States</placeName> from leasing&#8212;what the prices of 
mineral lead were before and since the war&#8212;go into as much detail in
your communication as you can find it convenient to make&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>house of Representatives</persName> are now engaged in discussing the
Bill for the establishment of a <persName>national bank</persName>&#8212;to revive the public
credit which at present appears to be at a low ebb&#8212; As soon as the
fiscal concerns are accomplished we may expect immediate provisions
in detail for raising an <persName>army </persName>as I hope sufficient to expel entirely the
<persName>British </persName>from the <placeName>Continent </placeName>and to coerce the <persName>Indians </persName>to friendly
intercourse and [mutilated] us&#8212; I think <persName>Mr. Munroe</persName>s first plan
[an] admirable one&#8212; By reading the [debates] of <persName>congress </persName>some of
which I shall send you on the subject of the <persName>Bank </persName>[you] will better
discover the state and condition of the <persName>Banks </persName>on <placeName>this side of the
mountains</placeName> &#8212;than I can inform you by letter Suffice it to say in
this place you cannot get a picaun in silver and bills for one cent are
in circulation No one bank will receive the paper of another 
without a discount of from 10 to 12 per cent.&#8212;</p>

<p>I had not arrived when the first section of the Bill to incorporate
the <persName>U. S. bank</persName> was under consideration in committee of the whole&#8212;
The <placeName>territories </placeName>had all been omitted I succeeded to day in one
amendment authorising the <persName>directors </persName>to establish <placeName>offices </placeName>where soever
they shall think fit in the <placeName>territories </placeName>for the purposes of discount
deposit and distribution&#8212;and think it would be much better if they<pb n="243"/>
were compelled by the law to establish one such <placeName>office </placeName>in each <placeName>state</placeName>
and <placeName>territory </placeName>whenever a certain amount of the capital stock should
be subscribed in such <placeName>state </placeName>or <placeName>territory</placeName>&#8212; the object would be to
prevent the specie from going out of the <placeName>State </placeName>into the <persName>Mother Bank
at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></persName>&#8212;but you might as well kick agt the pricks as to 
attempt it&#8212; It will however be strongly urged I suspect&#8212; I shall
try to [have the] first section so amended as to have [offices?] for 
subscription opened within our <placeName>territory</placeName>&#8212; Write me often your ideas
[on] these and other subjects which may occur</p>

<p><persName>R Easton </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>Be pleased to present my best respects to <persName>Mrs Austin</persName> and <persName>Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan</persName> and to <persName>Stephen</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I send you a Bank bill for five Cents.&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:]   <persName>Moses Austin Esquire Post Master</persName>  <placeName>Mine Potosi
Washington County Missouri Territory</placeName></p>
