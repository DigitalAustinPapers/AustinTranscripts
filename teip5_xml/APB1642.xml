<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have again been compelled to abandon my place <placeName>above the La
Bahia road</placeName>, much against my will I do assure You,    So long as
the <placeName>upper Settlement</placeName> maintained their ground I did not dispair<pb n="145"/>
being able to complete my <placeName>mills</placeName>; but after being deserted by my
<persName>neighbors </persName>I deemed it useless, and perhaps unsafe, to remain there
any longer;&#8212;however, I do not dispair of returning in a short
time&#8212;nothing within my power shall be wanting to reestablish a
<placeName>Settlement </placeName>at that place;&#8212;For this purpose I shall make such 
proposals to those who wish to Settle <placeName>in that part of the colony </placeName>as
cannot fail being accepted by all who wish well to the country <placeName>half
my land at that place</placeName> will I give, if necessary, to effect this desirable
object&#8212;could the <persName>uper settlers</persName> view the importance of maintaining
that place in the same light that I do, I am sure they would be less
captious and hard to please than I am afraid will be found to be
the case&#8212;If that <placeName>settlement </placeName>is suffered to break up and disperse it
will be a misfortune to the <placeName>colony </placeName>that many years may not be able
to retrieve&#8212; The late visits of the <persName>Comanchas </persName>must be ascribed
to the misconduct and imprudence of some of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>
themselves, who for the sake of a little base dishonest self interest would
sink the <placeName>colony </placeName>in irretrieveable ruin&#8212;If some means could be
devised to keep the <persName>Tonkuays </persName>and <persName>Lapans </persName>from coming among us,
it is probable we should not be troubled with the <persName>Comanchas</persName>
unless they wish to commence unprovoked hostilities against us,&#8212;
<persName>Two Indians of the Shawneys tribe</persName> came to my place more than
<date n="10-xx-1828">a month ago</date>, stayed with me several days and then started <placeName>up the
river </placeName>to explore the <placeName>country of the San Sabo</placeName>&#8212;They have not 
returned at the time they appointed, which was last <date when="1828-11-19">Wednesday</date>,</p>

<p>Considering the punctuality of <persName>Indians </persName>in keeping such 
appointments I think it very probable that they have been killed by the
<persName>Comanchas</persName>, as they are now in the <placeName>country </placeName>through which they
were to travel&#8212; These <persName>Shawneys </persName>had traveled a great deal through
the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> were <persName>men of considerable intelligence</persName>, and must have had
a good deal of influence with their <persName>nation</persName>&#8212; They said that if
they liked the <placeName>upper country</placeName> their people would commence settling
<placeName>35 or 40 miles above the San Antonio road</placeName> within three months
after their return&#8212;they left 58 deer skins, a little ammunition and
some other <persName>Indian </persName>trinkets with me&#8212;I have brought them away
and will leave them with<persName> Mr. Newman
</persName></p>
