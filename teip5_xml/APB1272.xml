<p><persName>Col Steven F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir I recd your letter by mail of the <date when="1826-08-27">27 of August</date> where
in you state to me the news of <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>being favourable on Slavery
which I have made known in the <placeName>settlement </placeName>wherein the <persName>people </persName>was so
much dissatisfied with the news that all thier <persName>slaves </persName>was to be set free
since I have not heard from there how they have taken the news but
I dont hesitate to say that I expect as usual I did not send your
letter but only a coppy of the <persName>slave </persName>news</p>

<p>Sir it is a mistake of yours to say that I am the<persName> father in law</persName> of
<persName>Gaines </persName>I am only a <persName>Brother in law</persName> but if he was my child its self I
would not correct him if I did not believe him to be wrong   he has<pb n="1449"/>
done nothing but what has went by the knowledge of the <persName>Alcalda</persName> of
this place and I need not go further than yourself to prove all the
representations that according to law should go through of this <placeName>court</placeName>
has not done so and you clone more than the <persName>chief of Department</persName>
done when he was applid to and it had not gone through its proper
channel he sent them back to take a fair start but you did not</p>

<p>if <persName>Gines [Gaines]</persName> has made any fals representations I would be
glad to know what they are that he may be checked in time it [is] a
fine thing to check before any thing is to far gone but to check a
man for obeying the orders of his <persName>Legal authority</persName> I dont think it is
right</p>

<p>sir from the present state of affairs our stength is verry divided
and it is I believe from such petitions as you translated you could
have known that this man was not aiming at the fair thing as he
could not obtain it here you must know in reason we have not more
men than we have a use for</p>

<p>if they could be expected by Government it appears that you had
no confidence in the proper authority of this place a <persName>stranger </persName>that
is not received by government should be heard and every attention
paid to him without asking any questions whether he was right or
wrong</p>

<p>                <persName>Samuel Norris</persName></p>
