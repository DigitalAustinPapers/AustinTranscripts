<p><persName>Genl. S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Texas</placeName>:	Saturday 12 oclk</p>

<p>My dear sir:</p>

<p>I hand you enclosed the <hi rend="italic">only </hi>letter I have for you, and avail of <persName>Col.
Lewis</persName>, who departs direct for <placeName>Texas</placeName>, to send you the same.&#8212; I have not
had the pleasure to receive a single line from you since we parted at 
<hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName></hi>. Tho' I have seen your letter to <persName>Swartwout</persName>.&#8212; I have noticed your
arrival at <placeName>Velasco</placeName>, and expected a letter from you by the <hi rend="italic">Shenandoah</hi>.&#8212;
I also find that Messrs <persName>Archer </persName>and <persName>Wharton</persName>, embarked, on board the 
Independence to return <placeName>home</placeName>.&#8212; The <hi rend="italic">latter </hi>drew on me for the $2,000 of the
Loan and obtained the Cash for it, in <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName>.&#8212; We have no news
from <placeName>Texas </placeName>except what is furnished us by the <placeName>public Prints</placeName>&#8212; <persName>Gen Mason</persName>
was at <placeName>Cincinnatti</placeName>. <date when="1836-07-20">20th Inst</date>, on his way to <placeName>Detroit</placeName>, and will probably be
here, some time <date n="08-xx-1836">next month</date>, and return to <placeName>Texas </placeName>in the <date n="Fall-1836">Fall</date>&#8212;so at least I
<hi rend="italic">understand</hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>parties </persName>here, are daily expecting the answer to the proposed Loan,
from your <persName>Govrnt</persName>.&#8212; If they do not accept the proposition for the 
remaining $90,000 as <hi rend="italic">stipulated</hi>; It is thought here that the <persName>Govmt</persName>. will be
willing to place the 10,000$ paid on the same footing as the <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>
Loan&#8212; It was subscribed to by the <persName>friends of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi>&#8212; I
wrote you in relation to it before and also about the <hi rend="italic">Bread </hi>Subscription
or donation, all which, no doubt you have ere this.&#8212; I trust your arrival
<placeName>home</placeName>, will have been in time to render, valuable service to the Cause and<pb n="410"/>
Country&#8212; for my own part, I have no apprehensions for the issue of
the 2d Campaign (Should the <persName>Mexicans </persName>ever Venture upon it) But you
must <hi rend="italic">keep </hi>up your <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>.&#8212; The <persName>Mexican Govmt</persName> have discovered that
without a preponderating force on the <placeName>Gulph</placeName>, they can do nothing; and
they will make every effort to obtain It. The next <hi rend="italic">campaign </hi>therefore will
be without doubt a <hi rend="italic">naval one</hi>&#8212; Therefore, I think you had always do
well to <hi rend="italic">keep up your naval force</hi>&#8212; with this, you have nothing to fear.&#8212;
I wrote <persName>Henry </persName>by this conveyance&#8212; He was last at the <placeName>Springs in 
Virginia</placeName>.&#8212; <persName>John </persName>and <persName>Archibald </persName>both well&#8212; All your friends here well&#8212;
and think of you often.&#8212; Pray write me and give me all the news of
interest.</p>

<p><persName>J. Treat</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] To <persName>Gen. Stephen F, Austin</persName> <placeName>Texas</placeName>.&#8212;</p>
