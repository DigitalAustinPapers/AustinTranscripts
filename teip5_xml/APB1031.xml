<p><persName>Mr. Stephen F. Austin</persName>,</p>

<p>Dear Sir as I have not been able to return to your <placeName>Colony</placeName> as soon
as I expected I hope you will excuse my Troubling you with this note<pb n="1031"/>
which I have got the Favor of <persName>Mr. Foster</persName> to hand you: the scarcity
of money and the Dulness of times has made business very hard to
settle in this <placeName>Parish</placeName>, not being able to settle my business to my 
satisfaction has prevented by returning and made it necessary that I
should make another crop on <placeName>Red River</placeName>, when I hope I shall be able
to Leave the <placeName>Parish</placeName> without any Difficulty&#8212; the prospect of the
price of cotton the next crop is Flattering, all state sales of the
present crop have been very good from Eighteen to Twenty two
cents and still looking up, which has made Considerable of a change
in this <placeName>Parish</placeName>. I hope that I shall be able to see you again in <date n="07-xx-1825">July</date> or
<date n="08-xx-1825">August</date>, there are a number of young <persName>men </persName>from this <placeName>Parish</placeName> talk of
going out this <date n="summer-1825">summer</date>. <persName>Mr. Stewart</persName> informs me that he made no
selection of Lands before leaving the <placeName>Colony</placeName>. I hope sir you will be
so good as to make a reserve for me on some part of the <placeName>Bernard
River</placeName> of some of the unsettled Land, from the number of <persName>Travelers</persName>
that have passed through this <placeName>settlement </placeName>going to your <placeName>Colony</placeName> I 
expect you have had a great many applicants for Land. If the one
half of them have reached you <placeName>Colony</placeName> I believe you have not been
Idle. The young <persName>man </persName>that will accompany <persName>Mr. Foster</persName> <persName>Mr. Grant</persName>,
I hope you will find a Verry useful man being and excellent 
workman he is also much Respected in this <placeName>parish</placeName> as good member of
society&#8212;If the <placeName>Lands of the Bernard</placeName> are not all Taken, and you have
not made any Choice for me, I will get the Favor of <persName>Mr. Foster</persName> to
attend to it and also to make a small Improvement on it for me, I
shall be glad to Receive a few Lines from you on <persName>Mr. Foster</persName>s 
Return&#8212;</p>

<p>I am with Respect yours</p>

<p><persName>David H. Holstein</persName></p>

<p>[Mr. Stephen F. Austin] Favor of <persName>Mr. Foster </persName><placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>.</p>
