<p><placeName>Bowling Green, Caroline County, Virginia</placeName>.</p>

<p><date when="1821-12-07">December 7th 1821</date></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I Have seen a publication in a <placeName>news paper</placeName>, purporting to be an
extract of a letter, written by you at <placeName>La Bahia, Province of Texas</placeName>,
on the <date when="1821-09-01">1st day of September 1821</date> and addressed to a gentleman at
<placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, wherein is set forth the advantages of a contemplated
settlement which you had in view in the above named province.</p>

<p>The extract above alluded to, states the following as the outline
which you propose to pursue in regard to the grants of lands: viz.
To give to each individual <persName>settler </persName>one tract of land binding on the
<placeName>river </placeName>or some water course, half a mile in front, by two miles in
depth for farming&#8212;and one other tract of one a half mile square to
be located back from the <placeName>river </placeName>for vachery; and that to those <persName>settlers</persName>
who have <persName>families</persName>, you propose the following addition to their
grants:&#8212;to each <persName>married woman</persName> 160 acres, to each <persName>child </persName>80 acres,
and for each <persName>slave </persName>40 acres; to be laid off adjoining the farming tract;
and double those quantities adjoining the <placeName>vachery tract</placeName>.</p>

<p>The object of this letter, is, to make some further enquiries about
the <placeName>settlement </placeName>as it is probable, that I and some others in this State
may avail ourselves of the advantages which it holds forth.&#8212;</p>

<p>You mention in the extract referred to above, that it is important
that the <persName>settlers </persName>should arrive by the month of <date n="02-xx-1822">February next</date> at
farthest.&#8212;1. Will none be admitted after that time?&#8212; 2 If any be
admitted after that time, what time do you set as a limit to their
availing of themselves of the advantages of the <placeName>settlement </placeName>? 3. Has
the country fully secured its independence on <placeName>Spain</placeName>? 4. If it has
not, is there any certainty of its securing it? 5. How far is the
heart of it from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>?&#8212;6. How far is it from the <placeName>sea<pb n="442"/>
coast</placeName>?&#8212;7. Or does it border thereon?&#8212;8. Does it join the <placeName>territory
of the United States</placeName>?&#8212;9. If not how far are they asunder?&#8212;10
Are there any <persName>settlers </persName>already in it?&#8212;11. If there are of what nation
are they?&#8212;12. Is it a healthy country?&#8212;13. How far is the town
site from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>?</p>

<p>The answer to these queries, (together with any other necessary
information respecting the <placeName>settlement</placeName>, which you may think proper
to give) you will please transmit as early as possible by a letter 
addressed to me, at <placeName>New Town, King and Queen County, Virginia</placeName>. I
shall most anxiously wait for an answer from you.    &#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Samuel Parker</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr Stephen F. Austin</persName> <placeName>New Orleans Louisiana</placeName></p>
