<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]</p>

<p><placeName>Matamoros </placeName><date when="1832-06-19">June 19. 1832</date></p>
<p><persName>H Chriesman Esqr</persName></p>

<p><persName>Prest of the Ayuntamto</persName></p>
<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>[I] arrived here a few days since, [and] as I must [be] in <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>
by the <date when="1832-08-28">28 August</date> when the <persName>Legislature </persName>will have its first or 
preparatory meeting, I have concluded not to return <placeName>home </placeName>until after the
<date n="09-xx-1832">September </date>session.</p>

<p>I am happy to hear that harmony prevails [among the people and
that pros]pects of crops are good</p>

<p>The [political disturb?]ances in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>will I think end very
favorably for the [cause] of liberty, and there is well founded cause
io expect a <persName>republican administration</persName> after the next election. I
[believe] the next <persName>President </persName>will [not] be a [militar]y <persName>man</persName>&#8212;in fact
the power [of the mili]tary is dayly becoming more [weak? I] mean
its <hi rend="italic">moral </hi>power. All [the bes]t men of the <placeName>nation </placeName>are becoming
[convinced] that there can never be harmony nor liberty, nor even
a republican government] untill the <persName>military authority </persName>is subjected
to the<persName> civil authority,</persName> and the <persName>army </persName>reduced. [I] believe this to be
one of the main objects of what is called the <persName>Santana Party</persName>&#8212;that
<persName>party </persName>will certainly get into power, and [if] there was only [a
<hi rend="italic">Th]omas <persName>Jefferson </hi></persName>Am[erican?] to place at the helm, <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
would be free and its republican institutions established on a solid
basis&#8212;but where is <hi rend="italic">such </hi>a <persName>man </persName>to be found&#8212;[certainly?] not in this<pb n="783"/>
<placeName>nation</placeName>. <persName>Guerrero </persName>ruined the old republican party by the incapacity
of a part of his absurd * * * and dessol * * * principles
of the whole of them. [Nor] will the <persName>Santana party</persName> do anything
better [tho] I hope they will. If a man of the talents and habits and
industry of <persName>Lucas Alaman</persName> could be found of the <hi rend="italic">right </hi>political
creed and sufficiently balanced, [of] honest and disinterested 
patriotism, [all would] go on well. We must however [hope for] the
best. I think it very probable [that] <persName>Garcia Governor of <placeName>Zacatecas</placeName></persName>,
[will be] the <persName>president</persName>&#8212;if so he will pu * * * <persName>Juan Dios
Ca[ñe]do[?]</persName> and make him <persName>secretary of state</persName>, decidedly the best
one that [could] be selected.</p>

<p>I fear that not much harmony has or will exist between the 
<persName>military </persName>and<persName> civil authorities of <placeName>Anahuac</placeName></persName> untill the new [state of ]
things places the power where it ought to be in all <placeName>republics</placeName>, 
subordinate] to the latter. However I hope that nothing of a serious
nature will occur. The course which ought to be pursued is a
very plain one, and [a very sim]ple one, it is this&#8212; Every outrage,
disorder arbitrary or illegal act of the <persName>military </persName>ought to be reported
officially [with the evidence to the?] <persName>Chief of department</persName>&#8212;those
who are [misused?] ought to go before the nearest <persName>alcalde</persName>, or any
<persName>alcalde </persName>[the one of the municipality of Austin would be the best]
and make a [clear] and full declaration in [writing?] under oath
and * * * sustained?] by witnesses&#8212;this declara[tion an]d all
the proceedings ought [to be re]corded in the judicial records [and
co]pies sent to the <persName>Chief of Depart[ment]</persName> and redress ought to
be asked but in the most respectfull manner. All acts of violence
ought to be avoided and put down or stoped. But should [acts]
occur of so flagrant a nature that public indignation could not be
restrained, a thing which my knowledge of military opperations
generally in <placeName>Texas </placeName>c[auses me] to fe[ar ma]y happen, great ca[re]
must be taken not to do or say anything against the Govt, <hi rend="italic">take
gre[at] care and use great prudence on th[is] point.</hi> If any public
act, or publication is made, head it with " Fidelity and [obedience to
the laws and] the Constitution a[nd nation, or so]mething of that
kind.</p>

<p>Let all your acts if any are made, begin with an article that in
express terms declares the fidelity and rigid adherance of the <persName>people
to <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName>, to the State, to the Constitution and System of 
Government now adopted etc&#8212;then go on to shew [what] particular 
outrages had be[en com]mitted state what they are by [acts?] committed
and all the facts&#8212;[shew] that legal redress had been [requested?]
in [vain?]&#8212;the laws were no longer respected&#8212;the guarantees of
the Constitution no longer any safe guard and for <hi rend="italic">these </hi>reasons, and
not [through] disaffection to the government violence had [be]en<pb n="784"/>
or would be resorted to as the last and the only [reme]dy etc. But
let all be done calmly, not one rash or abusive word ought to [be
use]d&#8212;nothing that indicated passion or excitement or <hi rend="italic">personal</hi>
f]eelings or animosity of a <hi rend="italic">personal </hi>nature against any one&#8212;let
all be mild, decorous and respectful but clear and firm&#8212;in short
let it be a plain, open and unvarnished statement of facts. Also
anything of the kind that is done and all the facts ought to [be]
published] in Spanish and english and more especially in <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>
and sent to all the free and <placeName>liberal papers </placeName>in the <placeName>nation</placeName>, and to the
government. Also if any official complaints are made to the 
government they ought to be published in Spanish and English&#8212;
[if th]is course be adopted you will at once see the great importance
of having all such publications drawn up in pure and decorous
language and in handsome stile&#8212;this is all important&#8212;for such
papers [do not appoint a] com[mittee of] <persName>persons </persName>who have [not]
a correct grammatical knowledge of the English language, or whose
stile is inflated or bombastic or loaded with obscenities or a 
superabundance of useless words etc [it] would [be * * *] exposing
the <placeName>colony </placeName>to ridicule [every] where&#8212;this is in fact <hi rend="italic">all </hi>[import]ant&#8212;
under that view of the matter I hope no one will take it amiss if
I recommend you to call in the aid of <persName>P. W. Grayson</persName>, <persName>Doctor
Archer</persName>, <persName>T. J. Chambers</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Alexander Greaves</persName>. Also <persName>Father
Muldoon</persName>&#8212;the three last for the Spanish language in particular, and
<persName>Mr. Greaves</persName> most particularly, f[or I know] that his knowledge of
the Spanish is better than any mans in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;he is an elderly, a
silent, and a calm and prudent man.</p>

<p>You will of course perceive that all I have said on this subject is
predicated on the <hi rend="italic">fear</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">cireumstances </hi>may drive some of the
<persName>people on <placeName>Trinity</placeName></persName> to desperation&#8212;if so and the cause is just, the
sympathies of the <placeName>colony </placeName>will be enlisted&#8212;it cannot be [prevented]
and indeed I believe it ought not to be, for all outrages against law,
justice and good morals are attacks upon the whole <placeName>community</placeName>, 
however low or * * * the individual may be who is <hi rend="italic">personally</hi>
assailed.</p>

<p>There is one point which must be kept in view, which is that by
the constitution and laws [of the nation] and of the [sta]te the
<persName>military </persName>are not subject to the judicial power; they are a privileged
order, and cannot be tryed by a <persName>civil judge</persName> for any offense&#8212;a most
infamous and unrepublican principle,&#8212;but [allowed by?] 
constitution and law, and as such must be sacredly respected&#8212;[an] <persName>alcalde</persName>,
or <persName>judge</persName>, cannot punish a <persName>soldier</persName>&#8212;keep this in view&#8212;take care and
have all the law as well as all the justice on your side, for you see that
under this military system what is law is sometimes very far from
being justice&#8212;the rule which I have given to the [state?] and gen-<pb n="785"/>
eral govt, and to all others with whom I conversed as to the <persName>people of
<placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>is as follows&#8212; "They will adhere to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and rigidly
execute their duty to the constitution and laws, and religiously 
observe [their] oaths [as] <persName>Mexican citizens</persName>&#8212;but at the same time they
will with great pertinacity [do] their duty to themselves and to their
<persName>neighbors </persName>as members of one political <placeName>community</placeName>&#8212; If their rights
are violated, they will seek legal redress in a calm and peaceable and
constitutional manner&#8212;if that fails and&#8212;or [is] treated with 
contempt they will then and not before, seek redress by any means in their
power of an honorable and open nature for they <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> tamely
submit [to] illegal outrages&#8212;also they consider an in[vasi]on of the
constitutional rights of one man, as an attack [on the] whole 
<placeName>community</placeName>.</p>

<p>If I know the<persName> people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, as I think I do, I am confident
that they will prove by their acts and declarations the above is 
correctly applied to them and especially the first clause of it.</p>

<p>My own individual motto has always been<hi rend="italic"> adherence and fidelity
to <placeName>Mexico</placeName></hi>. Under the influence and guidance of [this] motto I
have been enabled to [succeed] in securing to the <persName>settlers </persName>of my
<placeName>col[ony]</placeName> all the benefits they [have] obtained [as far as?] I have
had an agency in procuring them, and I will here, as I have often
before, recommend it as [the] standing motto of the <placeName>colonies</placeName>, and
[a]s a general and standing popular toast&#8212;[It would?] tend to
remove the unj[ust prejudices an]d suspicions which m[any] good
men among the <persName>Mexicans </persName>have had, and will thus pave the way for
our permanent prosperity, by the removal of restrictions&#8212;Also it
will have a good effect at home, as a [poi]nter, a rallying point, a
<hi rend="italic">point d'appuit</hi> for p[ubli]c opinion, which is all important in any
community, to produce union and unity of action and of purpose
and besides all this, it is required of us by <hi rend="italic">our oaths</hi> as <persName>Mexican
citizens</persName>.</p>

<p>Another of my fixed rules of action as to <placeName>Texas </placeName>generally is that
with respect to her rights <hi rend="italic">she must always act on the defensive and
never on the offensive.</hi></p>

<p>In <date n="12-xx-1831">December </date>and <date n="01-xx-1832">January last</date> I act[ed] under the rigid guidance
of this [rule] I <hi rend="italic">think </hi>[now?] that there was a [strong?] 
determination to break up the * * * [of] <persName>American settlers</persName>, and that
any plausible pretext would be taken hold of to march an <persName>army</persName>
into that [coun]try. I formed this opinion from t[he a]cts of the
Govt, and * * * since * * * and * * * [line totally
gone] * * * [circum] stances which occurred in the * * *
department in <date n="11-xx-1831">November</date>&#8212;the appointment of <persName>Fisher</persName>, is w[as]
known was obnoxious and unpopular&#8212;it must have been known
that his  order or decree  of <date when="1831-11-24">24 Nbvr</date>.  last relative to the  com-<pb n="786"/>
merce or the<placeName> Brazos river</placeName> was high[ly] vexatious&#8212;one fixing the
<placeName>custom house at Anahuac,</placeName> instead [of <placeName>Galv]eston</placeName> where the law
really placed it&#8212;also the 20th article of that decree which 
subjected vessells then in the <placeName>river </placeName>to its vexatious restrictions was
retroactive and illegal from the face of it&#8212;a vessell may have been
six months in the <placeName>river</placeName>, with cargo all distributed over the <placeName>country</placeName>
and sold six months before the <placeName>custom house </placeName>[was] established, and
still by that arti[cle it] could not have gone to sea untill [the]
<persName>master owners</persName> etc [wen]t to<placeName> An[ahua]c</placeName> and presented manifests,
and paid the duties which were not due nor collectable when the
vessell came in and discharged. The whole thing in [fact] 
evidently carried upon its face an intention [to irri]tate and to [make
difficulty it] <hi rend="italic">must have been</hi> supposed that it [would cause?] 
difficulty. The <placeName>nation </placeName>was then at peace its phisical f[orce the]n was
not para[ly] sed by internal wars, nor by the fear of external 
invation and the whole power of the <placeName>republic </placeName>would have been brought
to bear upon <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Al[so a]t that time the <persName>press </persName>[of] <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
was muzzled. There was no<persName> liberal party</persName>, no opposition to raise
its voice in favor of justice, and the prejudices of the<persName> mass of the
people</persName> were against all <persName>foreigners</persName>&#8212;we should have appealed to
justice in vain.</p>

<p>I believed we would be attacked. [I] have since been most 
positively assured that there was no such intention&#8212;be it so but that
does not change the mat[ter] as to us in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;situated as we then
were for anyone who had an eye to p[erceive?] ever [woul]d believe
that there w[as no such?] intention. In this state of things, 
[situated as I was with reference to the <placeName>colony </placeName>and to public opinion both
at <placeName>home </placeName>and <placeName>abroad </placeName>so far as anything was [know]n of me, it was
my duty to prepare for the general defense. So far as I c[oul]d,
I acted [on this principle?] until th[e arrival of the] mail which
came in at that time brought the news of <persName>[Sant]ana</persName>s affair at <placeName>Vera
Cruz</placeName>. I also had some other information of a peculiar nature which
had its influence with me. I [be]came convinced that <placeName>Texas </placeName>could
not be attacked by the <persName>Govt</persName>, for the want of [phy]sical force to do
it, and also because the influence of liberal principles was gaining
ground too fast in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, to give the <persName>administration </persName>any time to
work an unjust attack upon anyone. So soon as I was [convince]d
of this, the necessity for preparations [at on]ce ceased, and then
agreeably [to the] rule before stated all further [preparations
would have been impro[per im] politic and even highly [immor?]al
for we ought not in any case to [act o]n the <hi rend="italic">offensive</hi>. B[ut] much
had [bee]n said&#8212;something had been done&#8212;and much had been
written&#8212; to [un]say, undo, and <hi rend="italic">unwrite </hi>all this was awkward and
embarrassing, for at a superficial view it looked like inconsistency
*** I did not [hesitate to set?] to <hi rend="italic">work undoing</hi>*** in<pb n="787"/>
fact got up the <hi rend="italic">memorial </hi>as much with a view to allay public 
feeling by <hi rend="italic">giving </hi>something for hope and expectation to feed upon, as
for any other cause. I mean the memorial as it was finally adopted
and not as it was at first [contemplated.</p>

<p>Thus things have turned out&#8212;we adopted a very wise course&#8212;I
believe the best that could have been taken under the peculiarly
difficult circumstances and doubts in which we were placed. If
<placeName>Texas </placeName>will now keep quiet, and so [try to?] convince all that the
people do not [want to] seperate but are truly firm adhe[rents to]
the constitution and to the inte[grity of] the <placeName>Mexican territory</placeName> all
w[ill turn] out right and that <placeName>country </placeName>w[ill] be a [flour]ishing
state of the <placeName>Mexi[can] confederation </placeName>and a firm [and] efficient 
supporter of Mexican [li]berty and of its national rights. This is the
station I wish to see that <placeName>country </placeName>occupy and the one which I have
no doubt it will occupy.</p>

<p>This [letter is for the in] formation of the <placeName>Colony </placeName>generally but
not for [publi] cation&#8212;su[ffer n]one of it to g[et] into the 
<placeName>newspaper</placeName>, for altho it contains nothing which I have not said either
in writing or verbally to th[e la]st to the <placeName>state </placeName>and <persName>National govt
</persName>I have no desire to be figuring in the <placeName>newspaper</placeName>.</p>

<p>[I] have heretofore informed you [that I] would not consent to
be a <persName>candidate </persName>for reelection to the <persName>legislature</persName>. I now again say
the same and wish that this fact be stated in the <placeName>newspaper </placeName>for the
information of all.</p>

<p>[Pres]ent my respects to <persName>Mrs. Chrisman</persName> [and to] each of the
<persName>members of the Ayunto</persName>, [and to] <hi rend="italic">all </hi>others. Write me fully to
<placeName>Saltillo </placeName>[how you] are getting on.</p>

<p>[I saw] <persName>Genl. Teran</persName> the <date when="1832-06-01">first of this month</date> [at <placeName>Ta]mpico</placeName>&#8212;he
speaks very favorably of<placeName> T[exa]s</placeName> and in the most friendly terms.
I presume you have [ere] this received the law extending the time
two years for introducing certain things free of duty into <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
By some strange whim whiskey is admitted&#8212;and yet iron and 
farming [tools] and furniture are not&#8212;[yet it is a] cu[rse] the others
are indispensable and ***</p>

<p>May heaven [bless you] all and the <placeName>Colony  </placeName>is the sincere prair of
your friend and Humble Sert</p>
