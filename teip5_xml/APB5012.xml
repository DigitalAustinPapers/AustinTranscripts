<p><placeName>Head Quarters above Bexar</placeName> <date when="1835-11-02">Nov., 2 1835</date></p>
<p>To <persName>Colo. Bowie</persName> and <persName>Capt. Fanning</persName>,</p>

<p>I enclose you the result of a <persName>council of War</persName> held <date when="1835-11-02">this morning</date> by the
<persName>officers of this division</persName>&#8212;you will see that the <persName>Council </persName>has decided it is
inexpedient to attempt to take <placeName>Bexar </placeName>by storm at present&#8212;that the <persName>army</persName>
should take such a position as will enable it to harrass the <persName>enemy </persName>as much
as possible, out of reach of Cannon until the 18 pound battering pieces and
additional <persName>reinforcements </persName>arrive&#8212; This decision is submitted to the 
consideration of the <persName>officers of your division</persName>.<pb n="230"/></p>

<p>In addition I will add several suggestions that were made&#8212; One is to
occupy the <placeName>Mill </placeName>by <persName>200 men</persName> and post the balance <placeName>on the river</placeName> under cover
of a <placeName>bank </placeName>above and continue the <persName>battallion </persName>below in the position it now
occupies&#8212; To this it is objected, that our force is not sufficient to invest
the <placeName>town</placeName>, so as to prevent supplies from entering and that no important
object can be effected in that way, that more can be done by uniting the
<hi rend="italic"><persName>whole force</persName> <placeName>above town</placeName></hi> and sending out parties of <persName>50 men</persName>, every day and
night to range around, drive off cattle etc. As to corn it is certain they
have a large supply inside&#8212; This point is therefore also submitted to your
consideration, whether or not the <persName>whole force</persName> ought to be united <placeName>above
town</placeName> where corn is plenty and harass the <persName>enemy </persName>by keeping out beeves by
means of <persName>detachments </persName>and wait until the battering cannon and <persName>reenforcements </persName>
arrive or whether the <persName>army </persName>should remain divided as it now is.</p>

<p>To decide this point, the only question is this; can the <persName>present force </persName>
invest <placeName>Bexar </placeName>all around? if it can not, how can beeves be prevented from
going in, except by keeping <persName>detachments </persName>constantly out? Can these 
<persName>Detachments </persName>be sent and kept out, at all, while the <persName>Army </persName>is divided?</p>

<p>I will now make a suggestion of my own for your consideration&#8212; It is
this&#8212; you will take a safe position <placeName>below</placeName>&#8212; I will do the same <placeName>above each
<persName>division</persName></placeName> will be subdivided into <persName>parties of 20 or 25 men</persName>&#8212;one of these
<persName>parties </persName>will leave the <placeName><persName>upper division</persName></placeName> at day light and range around on the
<placeName>west </placeName>and sleep with you at night&#8212;a similar <persName>party </persName>will start from your 
division at the same time from the <placeName>mouth of Salado</placeName> and the <placeName>missions up the
Salado</placeName> and sleep here at night&#8212;a similar <persName>detachment </persName>will start at night
from each <placeName>camp </placeName>and range around in the same way until they make the
circle and get back to their respective divisions&#8212; I prefer this 
arrangement to the other.</p>

<p>I shall await your answer before I come to a final conclusion.
I shall dispatch a <persName>confidential man</persName> back to bring out the 18 pound
cannon and Shot, and also send <persName>Farmer </persName>to <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>to make round ball&#8212;
but shall not do it untill I receive an answer from you to this 
communication&#8212; I therefore wish you to give me an answer as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Should you be decidedly of opinion that the <persName>whole force</persName> should be united
&#8212;you can act on that decision at once, without any further order from
me&#8212; Should you prefer remaining, do so, and give your opinions as to the
best way of keeping out beeves&#8212;</p>
