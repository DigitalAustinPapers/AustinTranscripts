<p><date when="1807-08-24">Augt 24th [1807</date>]</p>
<p>I <date when="1807-08-23">yesterday </date>received your letter by <persName>Mr Ruggles</persName>&#8212;yours which you
mention as having sent by Mail, has not yet come to hand&#8212;</p>

<p>I have not yet heard anything from <persName>Austin Elliot</persName>&#8212; I shall 
expect him daily&#8212;<persName>Aunt </persName>has not yet arrived here&#8212; I hope to see her
very soon. When <persName>Austin </persName>arrives, it will take but a short time for me
to get ready to go on&#8212;I should have been ready before this time, if
I had had anything to do with. I shall endeavour to procure the
articles you mentioned&#8212;I think I shall be able to get them all, and
shall have them [put up in] the best manner possible&#8212;</p>

<p>I have written to <persName>Stephen </persName>this day, and requested him to write you
immediately.&#8212;I have been cautious not to mention to anyone, 
(except <persName>Mrs A.</persName> <persName>Mrs Richard</persName>, and her <persName>Son</persName>,) what my expectations are in<pb n="136"/>
moving to <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>.&#8212; <persName>Charles </persName>appears very friendly, but it is
possible (as you mention) that he may endeavour to stop any funds
he may know came from you&#8212;I shall endeaveour that he shall know
nothing about it&#8212; He is at present in very ill health, and has gone
in the <placeName>Country </placeName>to recruit&#8212; I dont think he will trouble anybody
much longer&#8212;I received a letter some time since from <persName>Capt. Bissel</persName>,&#8212;
He had not been able to obtain a furlough, and did not expect to come
on this <date n="Summer-1807">Summer </date>with <persName>Mrs B</persName>&#8212; He informed me that <persName>Capt Smith
</persName>had sold his claims at the <placeName>Mines</placeName>, for Ten thousand Dollars&#8212; If
so, ho did not make so much disturbance last Winter for nothing
he got well paid for it&#8212; I shall inform you from time to time, of
our progress in getting away</p>

<p><persName>H. Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Mrs Richards</persName> desires to be particularly remem'd to you.&#8212;
We shall undoubtedly have a War with <placeName>England</placeName>.&#8212;   They are
fortifying the <placeName>Harbour of New York</placeName>, and putting all the <placeName>Sea Ports</placeName>
in the best state of defense</p>

<p>The <persName>British in <placeName>Canada</placeName></persName>, are Sending all their Artillery and sloops
to <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, and are determined to defend it to the last, expecting that
the first attack from the <placeName>United States </placeName>will be in that <placeName>Quarter</placeName>&#8212; It
is unnecessary for me to say more, as you will probably get all the
newes through the <placeName>Papers</placeName>.&#8212; I see by the <placeName>Papers </placeName>that <persName>Major Wescot
</persName>is arrested as a <persName>Burrite</persName>.&#8212;</p>
