<p><placeName>Nachitoches </placeName><date when="1821-07-13">July 13 1821</date></p>
<p>My dear <persName>Mother </persName>and <persName>Sister</persName></p>

<p>I have just heard the meloncholy news of the death of my <persName>Father</persName>&#8212;
his exertions on the trip to <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> and after his return were too
much&#8212;he suffered more than you, or any one else can immagine who
has not been in this wild Country&#8212;We must resign ourselves to the
dispensations of Providence, death must finally terminate the career
of us all. This news has effected me very much, he was one of the
most feeling and affectionate <persName>Father</persName>s that ever lived his faults I
now say, and always have, were not of the heart&#8212; It is some 
consolation to me that he was with his <persName>family</persName>, or at least with a part of
them&#8212; I had progressed on my journey beyond the <placeName>Sabine </placeName>when
I heard the news&#8212; My Friend <persName>Hawkens </persName>wrote me from <placeName>Orleans</placeName>,
and the letter was sent on by <persName>express</persName>&#8212; I returned <date when="1821-07-13">this morning</date> to
arrange some business with the <persName>Spanish Agent</persName> here, and shall leave
here again this evening. My <persName>party </persName>will wait for me at <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>&#8212;
it is the opinion of the <persName>Spanish Officers</persName> here that this most unhappy
event will not retard the progress of the <placeName>settlement</placeName>. I shall go out
and take possession of the land and arrange for the <persName>families </persName>to move
in the <date n="Fall-1821">fall</date>&#8212;so that I still hope great good will result from my
<persName>Father</persName>'s astonishing perseverence and fatigue <date n="Winter-1820">last winter</date>&#8212;</p>

<p>I pray you to be carefull of your tender health. I hope to 
embrace my Dear <persName>Mother </persName>and <persName>Sister </persName>once more <date n="Fall-1821">next fall</date>,   immediately<pb n="402"/>
after my return I shall go to <placeName>Herculaneum </placeName>and probably from there
to <placeName>Kentucky</placeName></p>

<p>farewell my Dr <persName>Mother   </persName>May heaven preserve you once more to
meet your affectionate Son</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>I wish you to write me fully all the particulars directed to this place
care of <persName>Dr J. Sibley</persName> and pay the postage, so as not to make it 
necessary for him to do it&#8212;the letter will be here by the time I return&#8212;¦
Kiss <persName>Sister</persName>s <persName>little Boys</persName> for me and love to <persName>Aunt Austin</persName> and family
I should like to receive a letter from <persName>Emily </persName>or <persName>Bryan </persName>before I go
back</p>
