<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p><persName>McKinstre </persName>has a very likely <persName>negro </persName>27 years of age, healthy and a good
<persName>field hand</persName>&#8212; he has ran away owing to a terrible whipping <persName>Mc</persName> gave him
the other day, but I believe has no very bad habits&#8212; he asks twelve 
hundred dollars cash&#8212; I have an idea of buying him&#8212;what do you think of
the price&#8212; if I take him will send him to you untill I need him</p>

<p>There are 3 mules here at $100 a piece, I have not seen them, <persName>Austin</persName>
says they are large and young&#8212; I am told there are some Mexican chairs
leather bottom of the kind called Poltrona, to be sold out of the prizes&#8212;
I want one of them and one would suit <persName>Emily</persName>, they are easy chairs to sit
on or sleep in&#8212;</p>

<p>There are also some Mexican mats you ought to buy some of them&#8212;
they are very good for floors and very neat; quite a nice article, that is
if they are of the kind I mean wove fine with variagated colours. You may
perhaps see some other things that will suit you, and you ought to go to
the sale.</p>

<p>you might perhaps buy or receive in payment of debts Govt, paper&#8212;
you will need some to pay Taxes which will be high&#8212;</p>

<p>I have bought a pony and send you the mule which you can keep as a
work mule untill I need him&#8212; <persName>Collinsworth </persName>brings very favorable news
as to our admission into the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> thinks we shall be admitted this winter
if we push this matter I think I shall take a house at <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>and divide
my time between that and this&#8212; I can get no house here for the land
business</p>

<p>My health is improving very slowly</p>

<p>Love to <persName>Emily</persName>; tell her not to fret about any thing&#8212;all is,going well&#8212;
There will probably be some <persName>Mexican </persName>cruiser on the <placeName>coast</placeName>, but no invasion&#8212; all is revolution in the <placeName>interior of Mexico</placeName>&#8212; <persName>Santa Anna</persName> is to
remain for the present</p>

<p>Be very cautious in talking about what I say to you&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName> <placeName>Peach Point</placeName></p>
