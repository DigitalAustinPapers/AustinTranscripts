<p><placeName>Mine Au Burton</placeName> <date when="1803-08-18">Augt. 18th. 1803</date>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you about Twelve Month passed and forwarded you a
Statement of <persName>S Austin</persName>s business and mine to which I Requested your
friendly attention since which I am without Information from any
of those I aught to Consider my <persName>Friends in the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>. I am
truly desirous to have my business settled with <persName>S Austin</persName> that I may
again make a Visit to my <placeName>Native land</placeName> If nothing better can be don
get from <persName>S Austin</persName> the terms on which he will settle all the Dis[cords
and disput?]es between us and If I ca[n secure a disc?]harge from
him f[or the expenditure?] in full of Two or three thou[and 
dollars?] I shall willing [ly] do so</p>

<p>I [am truly sorry f ?]or <persName>S Austin</persName>s situation which [is due to his
son?] <persName>Charles Austin</persName> and from [what I learn it is tr?]uly 
disagreeable. I w[as in hopes that th?]is New Undertaking with
<persName>Phelps </persName>and <persName>Sandford </persName>would prove advantageous in this adventure.
I hope I am not charged with the Cause of its Miscarrage Nothing
would give me greater Satisfaction then to see and hear of <persName>S Austin</persName>s
Welldoing, notwithstanding I am fully Acquainted with all his
Conduct towards me as also that of <persName>Charles Austin</persName> but I am greatly
Disposed to do away all disputes with <persName>S Austin</persName>. I have wrote
<persName>Mr Phelps</persName> again and If anything can be don you will be so good
as to write me immediately. Within a few days past I recd letters
from the <placeName>States </placeName>that informed me that <placeName>France </placeName>has Ceded the whole<pb n="88"/>
of the <placeName>province of Louisianna</placeName> w[ith?] <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> to the <placeName>United
States</placeName>. If [this be so this coun?]try will present the grea[test 
opportunity for] a Young man of any in the [whole world?] If you
have any Intentions of [ever coming out?] this <date n="Fall-1803">fall </date>will be the time
b[ring b?]lankets, Pewter knives and forks, . . . do Common Brown
L[inen?] . and large India Handkf. with large Blue Handkf of
a large Kinde wool Hatts Nankeens Blue Cottons Blue Nankeens
and all kinde of Tools such as Screwaugers chysells Handsaws 
Drawing Knives, and all kinde of tooles for a <persName>Carpenter </persName>all these things
will command at wholesale 40 p Ct from the <persName>New York </persName>price 
provided they are well bought. I am told <persName>Mr Phelps</persName> has a large quantity
of India goods If so maybe he would furnish your <persName>Son </persName>with an
adventure but in all these things take into Consideration that a
Return cannot be mad[e] Short of twelve month. I have mention
these things to [you?] that you might make use of the[m] [as you
thou?]ght proper I pray you to [offer my best respec?]ts to my
<persName>Sister </persName>and also <persName>Miss ! .</persName>    all her <persName>friends </persName>are well</p>

<p><persName>M Austin  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>NB If you [ever expect to co?]me to this <placeName>Country </placeName>[come now?]
[s]end me the Dried c[orn?] [I mention ?]ed to you.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Doctor Aaron Elliott <placeName>Killingworth Connet</placeName></persName>.</p>
