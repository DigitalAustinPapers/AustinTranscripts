<p>At <placeName><persName>Jas Lynch</persName>es</placeName>   <date when="1824-07-25">July 25th 1824</date>.</p>
<p><persName>Col. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Sir It was with much Pleasure that I received the few lines from
you by the hand of <persName>Mr Lynch</persName>&#8212;respecting my land you wrote that
there is a good <placeName>League on the St Bernard</placeName> that I can get should it
suit me, I make not the smallest Doubt of its suiting me&#8212;You say
it is a good League which is sufficient proof for me if it is rich
timbered Land it is the kind of Land that I want&#8212;in fact I leave
it intirely with yourself to enter my League and you can make out<pb n="858"/>
my Deed and give it to <persName>Mr. Lynch</persName> or keep it yourself until I
return whichever you may think best&#8212;-I am entirely willing to
submit to the rules and regulations that you may make with the first
<persName>settlers</persName>,&#8212;if you will give my deeds to <persName>Mr. Lynch</persName> you can hold
this Letter which will be the same as my obligation&#8212;I can pay you
two hundred Dollars or perhaps more this <date n="Winter-1824">winter </date>in good property
if requested, in fact my will is to oblige you at any time when in
my power. I shall start <placeName>home </placeName>in a few days in the Highest spirits
and will return with my <persName>family </persName>this <date n="Fall-1824">fall </date>if life lasts.&#8212;</p>

<p>Now Sir if my League is allready surveyed as I have to draw
Land for my e[l]dest son in my own name there is one or two
young <persName>men </persName>who will come on with me that will attach themselves to
my <persName>family</persName>&#8212;if I am in titled to any more land besides my League and
Labbour by the size of my <persName>family </persName>or for building a <placeName>mill</placeName>, I will take
it on the <placeName>Creek </placeName>that is called <placeName>Seeder Creek</placeName> at the <placeName>first main fork
above <persName>Simon Miller</persName>s tract</placeName> which is at a place known by the <placeName>Board
Camp</placeName>.</p>

<p>Sir if you think propper to give me a grant agreeable to the rules
authorized by the <persName>government </persName>for building a <placeName>mill </placeName>I will obligate
myself to build a good <placeName>mill</placeName>.</p>

<p>The place that I have Described I located in <date n="12-xx-1821">December 1821</date> which
[if] I can shall yet [get?] I located it for the purpose of building a
<placeName>mill </placeName>it will not interfere with any <persName>settler</persName>&#8212;but if it should 
interfere with any arrangement allready made I will take it at the
<placeName>second crossing of the second fork of the Navisota on the Labberdee
road </placeName><placeName>Commencing at the road and running Down for quantity
</placeName>this would be Convenient to the <placeName><persName>Millikin</persName>s settlement</placeName> if you think
proper to grant this petition you will please to inform <persName>Mr. Lynch</persName>
and he will attend to the Surveying etc</p>

<p>I hope Sir you will excuse my troubling you so much at so busy
a moment of your Business&#8212;And receive the best wishes of your
most obd. Friend and well wisher</p>
