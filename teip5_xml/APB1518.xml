<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName></p>

<p><date when="1828-03-31">March 31. 1828</date></p>
<p>Dr Brother and Sister,</p>

<p>On my return from the seat of Govt of this <placeName>State </placeName>last winter I
found your letter transcribing <persName>Learning</persName>s letter relative to the
<placeName>claim in New Jersey</placeName>, and<persName> Brother James</persName> and myself without delay
executed a power of attorney in due form to <persName>Mr. Learning</persName> and sent
it direct to him in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName></p>

<p>I know nothing of the title deeds for <placeName>land in Virginia</placeName> that you
speak of&#8212;I remember having seen two parchment deeds for land
in that country in <persName>father</persName>s writing desk about the time he removed
to <placeName>Hercuianium</placeName>&#8212;but what became of them or wheither they were
for the tracts you allude to I know not. perhaps he took them with
him in the desk to <placeName>Little Rock</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Brother </persName>and myself will give any power of attorney that may be
necessary to prosecute our claim to the <placeName>Mine á Burton</placeName> property
but we have not the means to advance money neither can we do it
at any short period</p>

<p>You are doubtless ere this informed by <persName>Brother</persName>s letters of the
important change that has taken place in his situation, he was
married on the <date when="1828-03-20">20 of this month</date> at this place to <persName>Miss Eliza Martha<pb n="29"/>
Westall</persName>&#8212;he has made a good choice and I think has secured his
domestic happiness&#8212;we are trying to arrange matters to set him
and <persName>John Austin</persName> up in the Mercantile business in which there is
a good prospect of success&#8212;tho their begining is very small he
expects to be in <placeName>Orleans </placeName>in <date n="05-xx-1828">May </date>or <date n="06-xx-1828">June</date>.</p>

<p>I once had a <persName>sister </persName>who could spare a few moments every six or
eight months to drop a line to her unfortun[ate]? absent, brother&#8212;
Where is she? has time swept me from her remembrance, or has
she too many cares, or too much amusement to allow a half hour
to past remembrance&#8212;I feel almost cut off from the world, but still
something in her own handwriting would be acceptable, how many
<persName>children </persName>has she, how are they disposed of&#8212;what are her future
calculations She can tell me a thousand things that will be 
interesting, for she can write nothing that will be otherwise, It has been
more than 18 months since I have recd a line from her own 
handwriting&#8212;I never expect to converse with her otherwise than by
letter&#8212;time rolls on rapidly, tell her to improve it while she can
in chatting once more on paper to her brother-&#8212;</p>

<p>We move on here slowly, but quietly&#8212;this <placeName>country </placeName>will present a
<placeName>second Eden</placeName> to posterity&#8212;wheither we shall find it such or not
depends on the progress of emigration and improvements&#8212;</p>

<p>Farewell&#8212;give my love to all the <persName>children </persName>and to all old <persName>friends</persName>
and particularly to <persName>Elias Bates</persName> and <persName>family </persName>and other <persName>relations</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin  </persName>  [Rubricj</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James F. Perry </persName><placeName>Potosi Washington County
State of Missouri</placeName></p>
