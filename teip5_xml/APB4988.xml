<p><placeName>Salado </placeName><date when="1835-10-26">26th Oct 1835</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Father </persName>and <persName>Mother</persName></p>

<p>I wrote you the <date when="1835-10-24">day before yesterday</date> by <persName>express </persName>since that time the 
<persName>members of the consultation</persName> who are here 28 or 30 met and concluded to leave
it to the vote of the <persName>Army </persName>whether the <persName>members </persName>should return and take
their seat in the convention or remain untill after <placeName>San Anonio</placeName> is taken a
large majority were in favor of the <persName>members </persName>returning with the exception
of those who belonged to the <persName>staff</persName>, and those who might volunteer to
remain&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Travis </persName>is a <persName>member </persName>who volunteers to remain and there are others, when
the thing was first talked of I thought it would be the means of disbanding<pb n="212"/>
the <persName>army </persName>as I heard most every one say that he would return if the 
<persName>members of the convention</persName> left <persName>Doct Archer </persName>was appointed by the <persName>members </persName>to
address the <persName>army </persName>before the question was put, afterwards, <persName>Genl Houston</persName>,
and then <persName>Jack </persName>and lastly <persName>Uncle </persName>who was just able to sit on his horse all
purporting the same (that is) the propriety and even the necessity of 
sending the <persName>members </persName>back (those who were willing to go with the exception of
those belonging to the <persName>Staff</persName>) some 15 or <persName>20 men </persName>would go back any how
perhaps more</p>

<p>We are going down to the<placeName> mission of the Espada</placeName> to take up our quarters
&#8212;I presume we will have <persName>400 men</persName> when all have gone back who are 
dissatisfied perhaps not so many however they say with <persName>two hundred men</persName> we
can sustain ourselves in the <placeName>mission </placeName>we will be continually recg. 
reinforcements. and perhaps we will have <placeName>Bexar </placeName>in 4 or 5 days what are here
have pledged themselves to stand up to the tug untill <placeName>Bexar </placeName>is taken. <persName>Uncle</persName>
in his short speech told them that he would remain as long as <persName>10 men</persName>
would stick to him, because the salvation of <placeName>Texas </placeName>depends on the <persName>army</persName> being sustained and at the same time the meeting of the <persName>Convention</persName>
<persName>Uncle </persName>is better <date when="1835-10-26">this morning</date> than he has been for several days although
slightly salivated</p>

<p><persName>M. A. Bryan</persName> [Rubric]</p>
<p><persName>Joel </persName>is well</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James F Perry</persName><placeName> Peach Point</placeName> To the care of <persName>Jno. R.
Jones</persName> <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> who will please forward this
by the first opportunity&#8212;</p>
