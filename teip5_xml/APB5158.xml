<p><placeName>Lexington</placeName>, <date when="1836-04-21">April 21, 1836</date></p>

<p>Dear <persName>Cousin</persName>,</p>

<p>We had an overflowing Meeting <date when="1836-04-20">last night</date>, adjourned from the Morning,
when they merely organized, the <persName>Whig Convention</persName> being in session. I made
up a <persName>party of ladies</persName> and we all went, and never was I so complimented&#8212;
never so proud. And who do you think was the <persName>orator</persName>? The <persName>new 
Commissioner from <placeName>Texas </placeName>Col: Lewis</persName>. It so happened&#8212;a lucky coincidence
<hi rend="italic">for once</hi>&#8212;that he arrived from <placeName>Louisville</placeName>&#8212;(where he told us they had a
very enthusiastic Meeting)&#8212;in the afternoon. <persName>Mr. Higgins</persName>, the old 
<persName>gentleman </persName>they went to see, was in the chair. <persName>Mr. Bryant</persName> mentioned the arrival of
<persName>Col. Lewis</persName> and moved that a Committee be appointed to call on him&#8212;
invite him to attend the meeting. He came accordingly his presence gave
great spirit to the occasion. He addressed the audience and gave a clear
exposition of <placeName>Texas </placeName>affairs. Perfect silence and attention prevailed. He
occupied all the time. Several <persName>gentlemen </persName>were prepared to speak. Among
them <persName>Mr Wiggington of <placeName>Louisville</placeName></persName>, <persName>brother </persName>to him who started <date when="1836-04-19">two days
since</date> with his <persName>company of volunteers</persName>. <persName>Mr Bradford</persName>, <persName>Mr Ferguson</persName>, and
<persName>Gen: McCauley</persName> meant also to address the house. Some excellent 
resolutions and a memorial to <persName>Congress</persName>, prepared by <persName>Mr. Martin</persName>, passed 
unanimously and with great applause. Never was anything done with more
unanimity&#8212;more harmony. An <persName>Irish Catholic</persName> attempted to make some
objections on the ground of Committing the <persName>Govt </persName>etc; and was instantly
hissed and hooted down&#8212;with take him out&#8212;take him out etc. <persName>Col: Lewis</persName>
was presented to me at the close and I attempted to thank him for his fine
Compliments. I expected him here <date when="1836-04-21">this Morning</date>, but learn he is occupied
with <persName>visitors</persName>. <persName>Gen: McCauley</persName> just called, says they will have another
meeting <date when="1836-04-21">to night</date> to obtain subscriptions, a chance for <hi rend="italic">their cut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dried
speeches</hi>. You see we are doing well. There is great spirit now. You
began it,&#8212;by a little here and there we have kept it up, and <persName>Col: Lewis</persName><pb n="336"/>
has fixed the matter. I find you get news from <placeName>Texas </placeName>within two days as
soon as we do. I hope anxiously for something encouraging.</p>

<p>I had liked to have made a speech myself <date when="1836-04-20">last night</date>. What a theme it
is for eloquence. <persName>Col: Lewis</persName> appealed to my testimony as to the character
of the <persName>Texians</persName>, in reply to some slanders&#8212;and with effect if these people
have any pride. I almost rose from my seat to say that it was my proud
distinction to be able to testify to the truth etc.</p>

<p>The Mail closes&#8212; Love to all <persName>friend</persName>[s] Let them Have your portrait
to be lithographed.</p>

<p><persName>M A H [Mary Austin Holley]</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Gen. S. F Austin</persName> <placeName>New York</placeName></p>
