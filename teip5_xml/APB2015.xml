<p><date when="1825-06-03">June 3&#8212;1825</date></p>
<p>To the <persName>Honorable Judge Stephen F austin</persName></p>

<p>I have this moment received a few lines from you and do hasten
to make a fair statement in writing of the case as my health will not
admit me to Come over&#8212;we left <placeName>Orleans </placeName>on <date when="1825-03-13">13 March last</date> with
Fr[e]ight and <persName>passenge[rs]</persName> for this place <persName>Capt Allin</persName> the <persName>first 
offiscer</persName> or <persName>mate </persName>and experience [d] <persName>Ship mate</persName> we made a shipment of
tobaco and Flour whiskey and other goods <placeName>on board</placeName> where the profits
were to Be divided when sold&#8212;we arrived at <placeName>galveston </placeName><date when="1825-03-26">26 march </date>and
sent the boat ahead of the Schr to <placeName>Sound </placeName>and to keep her a head a
sufficient Distance to tack if <placeName>Shoal water</placeName>, when the signal was not
seen in time and finding the water too shoal and in the aim of 
tacking took the <placeName>ground </placeName>and stopt all night&#8212;we hove of[f] the <date when="1825-03-27">next
morning</date> without receiving any damage; the weather being fine 
permitted the <persName>passenges </persName>to go <placeName>on shore</placeName> and to find the <placeName>Channel </placeName>wich
they did but the wind rising so hard that they Could not return with
the large boat they tarrying so long <placeName>on shore</placeName> we made an attempt to
go off and in so doing we stopt <placeName>on the ground</placeName> we let go our anchor
and waited for the tide the wind rising and the <placeName>Sea </placeName>making the Schr
Began to beat on the bottom very hard and it was with much 
difficulty that a man Could stand and it being high water and it was 
impossible to go off without lighten her&#8212;if i had made the attempt and
failed again the vessel must have been lost and all the property and
some lives if not all for it blew hard that night.</p>

<p>i gave order to clear the <placeName>Deck </placeName>and to save what we Could if it had
been washt <placeName>over abourd</placeName> by the act of god i should have nothing to
say&#8212;but when it is the act of men and don Concianciuosly with the
intention to save as much as Can be don i do believe that every [body]
ought to bear a propotion of the loss the [schr] was not over loaded
and all the good on deck Could be put below&#8212;but to accomodate our
<persName>passenges </persName>we kept them <placeName>on Deck</placeName> to give them room below wich 
<persName>passengers </persName>was to com <placeName>on deck</placeName> Suppose i had gave orders to take all
the goods out of the whole and leave those <placeName>on deck</placeName> and pass over
them that was so near at hand and so convenient would it not appear
partial Surely my Conscience would condemed me and every one
on board&#8212;therefore it must be left to the master['s] judgement and
discretion under Such circumstances if he err the under writer suffer
and do not think that there is any law that point out a master duty
in all Circumstance and in all Cases and in all Climes and parts of
the world&#8212;to take the boat ahead and keep her a distance from you
100 Or 150 yards is a very safe and Continually practiced&#8212;I have
been condemned to pay for goods that was not in my bill of lading<pb n="1116"/>
and wich i had no knowledge of being <placeName>on board</placeName> and to pay for an
anveil that cost $10 or 12$ at <placeName>Orleans </placeName>one hundred dollars <persName>Mr. 
Cartwright</persName> waggon one half is been delivered with the harness the harness
he keep the two wheels and side he refuses&#8212;and my vessel to be sold
here [for cash ?] and since they have had hir in their [hands ?]
She has been driven<placeName> on shore</placeName> and no pains taken to git her of and
there beating by every hard wind up higher on the <placeName>bar of red fish</placeName> so
called where she will never be got of when she is lost I Cheerfully
submitt the Case to your Decision pray that if the vessel and goods
is to be sold that she will Sold for Country pay</p>

<p>this is a danger of the Seas and unavabl [unavoidable] occuren.</p>
