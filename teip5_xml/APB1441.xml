<p>Dear Sir The <persName>Bearer </persName>affords me an opportunity of 
communicating with you by private hand which Renders its passage more
certain. I have felt much anxiety about that <placeName>country </placeName>and still feel
But the Last measure of Your <persName>Govt </persName>on the <persName>slave </persName>question totally
forbids by mooveing there under existing circumstances Yet I will
most certainly see that <placeName>country </placeName>again probably in about <date when="1828-10-10">12</date> or <date when="1829-04-10">18
months</date> from this if not Required sooner to attend to my <placeName>Land
claims</placeName> which If necessary you will please apprise me. I have a
wish to make an establishment there of a <placeName>stock pen</placeName> and probably
will come prepared for the purpose and If so may make it a 
partial <placeName>Residence </placeName>and If the named objection should be Removed there
is no <placeName>country </placeName>in which I would be contented to till the soil except
that while <placeName>Texas </placeName>is Recollected by me.</p>

<p><persName>Judge Ellis</persName>' letter to his <persName>Lady </persName>dated in <date n="10-xx-1827">Augt</date>. came to hand and
before you receive this he will no doubt have departed for <placeName>home</placeName>
If not his <persName>family </persName>remains as usuall except <persName>Mrs. Ellis</persName> has sold his
<placeName>Land </placeName>and is Looking with much anxiety for his Return his 
Business Remains otherwise as he left it and his <persName>family </persName>generally well
and much Restored since the Rect of his letter in feelings as they
had become very uneasy I will close after asking you to be so good
as to Honour me with some Information from that <placeName>country </placeName>such as
may be of Interest and particularly Relative to my <placeName>Land claim</placeName> which
I left with you, what is Likely to be done with the <placeName>old claims</placeName> and
what necessary on my part how are the prospects of the <placeName>country</placeName>
generally etc It would give me great satisfaction as a matter of
Interest and afford an additional pleasure from consideration of
high Regard, present me to <persName>majr Herd</persName> If with you, your <persName>Brother</persName>
and <persName>friends </persName>tell your <persName>Brother </persName>I have two as pretty grey hounds as
he ever saw pups of <persName>Doctr Robertson's slutt</persName> which he had in <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
and would send them If I knew the passage could be relyed upon,
the <persName>old man </persName>(bearer) have known for some time by sight only.</p>
