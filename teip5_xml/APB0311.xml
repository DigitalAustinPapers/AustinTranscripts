<p><placeName>Herculaneum </placeName><date when="1818-07-08">July 8. 1818</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I am now here endeavoring to arra[n]ge my <persName>Father</persName>s business and
my own so as to leave this country&#8212;Orders have been lately recd
at the <placeName><persName>Surveyor</persName>s office</placeName> to prepare the <placeName>Red River property</placeName> for market
as soon as possible, and in consequence <placeName>New Madrid claims</placeName> have risen
very much&#8212;<persName>Langham and a Company</persName> are purchaseing them up to
locate on <placeName>Red River</placeName> and offer as high as 12.$ an <placeName>arpent </placeName>on a credit&#8212;
I think I can get a small claim for <hi rend="italic">5$ Cash</hi> and I have determined
to sell all your Flour and buy a <placeName>Madrid claim</placeName> with the money, and
not send down the Boat at all&#8212;I should have done so if the property
had been my own and very well know that it will be more to your
advantage to sell the f [lour] here at 8$ and buy a claim at 5$ than
to get 30$ a Barrel for it and loose the opportunity of geting a claim
even at any price&#8212;I value my improvement in the <placeName>Long Praire</placeName> at
100$ pr acre for it will yeald an interest, on the money (calculating
the land at 100$ pr acre) of at least 25 pr. cent and pay the expence
of working it besides&#8212;I shall therefore sell the Flour get a claim and
locate it for our joint benefit on my improvement in the <placeName>Long Praire</placeName></p>

<p>I can not tell when I shall leave here&#8212;My <persName>Father</persName>s business is all
in confusion&#8212;I advise you to return as soon as possible by Land<pb n="331"/>
and bring all the money you can with you and buy <placeName>Madrid claims</placeName>,
and take memorandum to locate them&#8212;you may depend that <placeName>choice
Land</placeName> will sell for not less than 50$ at the publick sales on <placeName>Red River</placeName></p>

<p><persName>James Cox</persName> appears to be very much dissatisfied about his fay 
particularly for the rent of his Plattin places, and intimates that he will
attach your <placeName>Property in Orleans</placeName>. I give you this information to put
you on your guard</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>I think you had better send the goods that are yet unsold to the
<placeName>Long Praire</placeName>, a small <placeName>Store </placeName>will do very well there</p>

<p>I Recd. your Letters from <placeName>White and Arkansas Rivers</placeName>, in the last
one you request me (to?) buy <placeName>Madrid claims</placeName> out of Funds to be
furnished by <persName>J. Austin</persName>. I think that you ought to hurry back as soon
as you can, for <persName>J. Austin</persName> is a poor hand to collect or attend to 
business&#8212; <persName>Brickey </persName>will attend to collections for one month, after which
he wishes his own time.</p>
