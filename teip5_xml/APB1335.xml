<p>[The Nacogdoches Insurgents were] treated with a degree of
lenity by the <persName>Mexicans </persName>they had no right to expect from the nature
of their crimes&#8212;and which I will vouchsafe would not have been
shewn them in their <placeName>native country</placeName> for similar offences&#8212;As to the
<persName>indians </persName>it appears that in place of <persName>twenty three tribes</persName>, having joined
the <persName>Fredonians </persName>only a small portion of the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Cherokees </persName></hi>immediately
under the influence of<persName> <hi rend="italic">Fields </hi></persName>and <persName>Hunter </persName>had entered into the 
<persName>alliance</persName>, and they together with the <persName>Chief </persName>have fled for safety to the
<placeName>other side of the Sabine</placeName>&#8212;The ballance of the <persName>tribes </persName>in this section
of the <placeName>country </placeName>are expected here in <date when="1827-02-25">two or three days</date> when I hope a
final adjustment of <persName>Indian </persName>affairs will take place&#8212;Inclosed I send
you a copy of two addresses one from <placeName>Stephen </placeName>to the <persName>Colonists</persName>&#8212;and
the other from<persName> Benjamin Edwards</persName> to the same, perhaps they will
not be inserted in any of the gacettes of <placeName>Missouri</placeName>. I am fearful the
late disturbance will put a temporary check to emigration.</p>

<p>I find by letter we received from <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> a few days since that
all hope of recovering the <placeName>Mine Au Burton estate</placeName> is over&#8212;I did hope.<pb n="1606"/>
that we should have been enabled to have recovered it, but for [my]
part I am satisfied,&#8212;as a few years will place us in a situation (in a
pecuniary point of view) far different from what we have been&#8212;
Report says this Valuable <placeName>Country </placeName>is about to be ceded to the
<placeName>U. S</placeName>.&#8212;some are of opinion that it is already&#8212; I know this much&#8212;
during my last visit to <persName>Saltillo </persName>a <persName>Mexican gentleman</persName> informed me
that previous to his leaving <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;a proposal had been made by
<persName>Mr Poinsett</persName> to purchase this <placeName>Country </placeName>as far as the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Rio Grande</placeName></hi> his
proposition was not acceded to on the part of this Govt, but it is
supposed another proposition was since made which has been acceded
to&#8212;Should this take place (which in my opinion will sooner or later)
We would not take less than $500-000 for our interest in this
<placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212;a private letter from <persName>Mr Poinsett</persName> states that the claims of
<persName>Empresarios </persName>who have complyed with their contracts will be
respected&#8212; Give my respects to <persName>Mr. Perry</persName>, and kiss the <persName>little ones</persName>
<persName>Stephen </persName>sends his love&#8212;We expect to leave this in a few days for
the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;do write me often&#8212;I have not seen a letter from you
for something more than one year.&#8212;</p>
