<p><placeName>Jackson La</placeName> <date when="1828-08-17">August 17 1828</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>The object of my writing you is to ascertain the prospects
your <placeName>colony </placeName>offers-&#8212;to the young and enterprising When quite
young I had the pleasure of knowing you at <placeName>Potosi </placeName>where my <persName>father</persName>
continues to reside,<date n="xx-xx-1823"> five years ago</date> I left home for the purpose of
educating myself with those means only which industry Supplied&#8212;
<date n="03-xx-1828">last March</date> the degree of <persName>Doctor </persName>of medicine was conferred upon me
by <placeName>The Transylvania school</placeName>, and am now engaged in the practice
of my profession&#8212; the patronage extended to me is quite flattering
to one of so utile experience as myself&#8212;</p>

<p>But the time for accumulating a fortune in this <placeName>country </placeName>by the
practice is past, and with it the only inducement the <placeName>country </placeName>ever
offered to <persName>emigrants</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>what is the size of <placeName>San Filipe de Austin</placeName>, its distance from the
<placeName>gulf </placeName>from the <placeName>city of Mexico</placeName> and from <placeName>Natchidoches </placeName>the number of
<persName>inhabitants </persName>in your <placeName>colony</placeName>, and the density of the population&#8212;<pb n="93"/>
the Health and the prospect a <persName>Physician </persName>would realize. I am well
aware how much I trespass upon your time&#8212;upon your kindness&#8212;
in inviting your attention to Subjects interesting to myself alone&#8212;
I cannot offer in palliation the kindness&#8212;your <persName>family </persName>has always
extended to mine, nor the marked friendship of your late excellent
<persName>mother </persName>towards myself to her admonition am I more indebeted than
to any other human being for the resuscitation from that state of
obscurity, into which the early pecuneary misfortunes of my <persName>family</persName>
had thrown me.&#8212;</p>

<p>You are already apprised of the unhappy state into which political
Schism has thrown our <placeName>republic</placeName>&#8212; in <placeName>S Carolina</placeName> open oposition is
threatened to the tariff how far their threat will be carried into
effect we can form no idia. their leading <persName>Politicians </persName>take a 
promenent stand with the opposition, verry considerable doubt exists of
the relection of <persName>Mr Adams</persName>&#8212;. I cannot but hope there is a 
redeeming spirit in the land which will counteract the effects of military
deeds upon the <persName>deluded multitude</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The Respects of an old <persName>Schoolfellow </persName>to you <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p><persName>W. A. Ficklin</persName></p>
<p><persName>Mr. S F Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>H K Schoolcraft Esqr</persName> A <persName>Scientific gentleman</persName> who for a 
considerable time during your absence resided with your <persName>father </persName>has
received a high appointment by government in a <placeName>Southern Exploring
expedition</placeName></p>
