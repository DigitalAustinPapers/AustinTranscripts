<p><placeName>Brasoria</placeName>, <date when="1829-05-26">May 26, 1829</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Sister</persName>.</p>

<p>your last came to hand in 16 days after its date. I am happy to
hear of your health and that of your fine <persName>family of children</persName>&#8212;
I wish I was in a situation to take <persName>Austin</persName>, but I think that he will
do better for the present where he is, we have no good <placeName>schools</placeName>
here, I will accept of the offer you make of him as soon as I think
it will be for his advantage to come out here&#8212;</p>

<p>I am now at <placeName>brother</placeName>s who has settled at this <placeName>place </placeName>probably for life or at least for many years&#8212;he is quite in the woods as yet, tho
comfortable, and has a fine <persName>Boy </persName>as ever I saw&#8212; this place is <placeName>20
miles by water from the Mouth of the river</placeName> and about <placeName>10 miles
from the coast in a direct line</placeName> I think it will become a place of
business</p>

<p>It is very uncertain when I shall visit <placeName>Missouri </placeName>not this year&#8212;
I cannot advise <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> to [move] here, neither do I advise
him not to move, he cannot form any correct opinion on the 
subject without visiting the <placeName>country </placeName>and spending at least two months
to examine it&#8212;</p>

<p>My health is none of the best, tho the <placeName>country </placeName>has been very
healthy this season, and we have the most promising appearances of
crops</p>

<p>I have nothing worth filling a letter with and therefore shall
wind up with the most sincere wishes for your health and prosperity
remember me to <persName>Mr Perry</persName> and all the <persName>children </persName>and to <persName>Mrs John
Perry,</persName> she ought to take a trip to the <placeName>coast of Texas</placeName>&#8212;this is a
wonderfull prolific and fertile country and much pleasanter than
that frozen region&#8212;remember me to my old friend <persName>John P</persName>&#8212;and to
<persName>Saml</persName>. etc</p>

<p><persName>Stephen   </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>there is no news of any Kind, this <placeName>country </placeName>improves&#8212;the <persName>settlers</persName>
are satisfied with the Govt and we have universal peace and 
tranquility in all <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mrs Emily M. Perry</persName>   <placeName>Potosi Missouri</placeName></p>
