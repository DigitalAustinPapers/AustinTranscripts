<p>Thursday night 12 oclk.</p>
<p><placeName>Mission of Espada</placeName> <date when="1835-10-22">22d- octr 1835</date></p>
<p><persName>Genl Austin</persName></p>

<p>At half after 4 oclk p. M we took possession of this <placeName>Mission</placeName>, with out
any resistance&#8212;A <persName>guard of five men</persName>, escaped us by only a few minutes&#8212;
We find the <persName>Citizens </persName>well disposed and quite communicative</p>

<p>A large number of the <persName>citizens of <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> and of this place, are now <hi rend="italic">laying
out</hi>, to prevent being forced to perform the most servile duties&#8212;We can
place the most implicit confidence in all the information read from <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
which is up to 5 oclk p. m. Great consternation was manifested there when
our approach to this point was made known&#8212;The <placeName>fortifications </placeName>are nearly
or quite such as before made known to you, with this addition, the <placeName>tops of
the Houses</placeName> and the <placeName>entrance of the Streets</placeName>, are <hi rend="italic">forified</hi>, with unburnt
<hi rend="italic">Brick</hi>, with Port holes, for their <persName>Infantry</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>They have 8 pieces (4 lb) mounted&#8212;and one of larger size preparing
for us. They have <hi rend="italic">none </hi><placeName>on the Church</placeName>&#8212;but have removed all their 
ammunition to it, and <hi rend="italic">enclosed </hi>it by a wall, made of wood, six feet apart and
six feet high, filled in with dirt, <placeName>extending from the corners to the ditch</placeName>,
say sixty yards in length&#8212;</p>

<p>We are informed that they have not got in corn or other provisions, and
we find it all <hi rend="italic">growing</hi>, or rather, <hi rend="italic">yet <placeName>in the fields</placeName></hi>: and are informed that it
is the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> <placeName><hi rend="italic">above</hi> Town</placeName>. When our approach&#8212;was ascertained the alarm
was great, and 14 Beef Cattle was ordered to be pened up&#8212;The <persName>men </persName>with
whom we have conversed&#8212;are decidedly of the opinion, that in <hi rend="italic">five days</hi>,
they can be <hi rend="italic">starved </hi>out.&#8212;<pb n="203"/></p>

<p>We propose to explore <hi rend="italic">above </hi>this early <date when="1835-10-23">tomorrow</date>&#8212;and will occupy the
<placeName><hi rend="italic">nearest point</hi> to Town</placeName>&#8212;bearing in mind the necessity of <hi rend="italic">holding </hi><placeName>this place</placeName>,
and keeping up a communication with you We would respectfully suggest
the propriety of the main army to take a position <placeName><hi rend="italic">above </hi>Town</placeName>, and <hi rend="italic">cut off
</hi>all provisions from <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, and we will attend to it <hi rend="italic">below</hi></p>

<p>This will alarm and intimidate the <persName>enemy</persName>, and inspire our <persName>friends </persName>with
renewed confidence, and will affect our object at once&#8212;</p>

<p>Should the <persName>re-inforcements</persName> arrive, and you can well spare them, <persName><hi rend="italic">fifty
men</hi></persName> will be acceptable, and we will then be entirely able to <hi rend="italic">take </hi>and <hi rend="italic">hold</hi>
any position, you may please to designate&#8212;</p>

<p>Owing to the late hour of our arrival, we have not examined the 
<placeName>missions </placeName>above, but have had it done by our <persName>Pilot</persName>, who reports only <persName>five 
soldiers at <placeName>St Jose</placeName></persName>, and none at <placeName>St Juan</placeName>&#8212;We learn that <hi rend="italic">no public</hi> stores are
collected at either place&#8212;The <hi rend="italic">Bean </hi>crops are <hi rend="italic">entirely distroyed</hi>&#8212;There is
corn in abundance, but the principal <persName>owners </persName>are in <placeName>Town</placeName>, and <persName>Couriers</persName>
will be dispatched early for them, to make contracts with [them] for the
<persName>army</persName>. There is corn here, but owned by <persName>men who Rent the <placeName>Land</placeName></persName>, and will
sell for <hi rend="italic">cash </hi>only, and only in small quantities</p>

<p>They have recd- no <persName>reenf </persName>or cements lately&#8212;and no news from <persName>Capt
Baragan</persName>&#8212;they have <hi rend="italic">removed </hi>nearly all the horses to <placeName>Lorado </placeName>on the <placeName>Rio
Grande</placeName>&#8212;and keep up at night those they have (from 2 to 300) and graze
them <placeName>near Town</placeName> in the day&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Their whole <persName>force </persName>does not reach 600, 
according</hi> to the report of a respectable <persName>gentleman</persName>, who escaped, with his <persName>family</persName>,
from <placeName>Town </placeName><date when="1835-10-22">this morning</date>, and now with us</p>

<p><date when="1835-10-23">Early in the morning</date> a <persName>Courier </persName>will be dispatched to <placeName><persName>Segine</persName>s Ranch</placeName>,
where <persName>Juan </persName>is, but the <persName>old man</persName> is <placeName>in Town</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Genl. Cos</persName> has threatened to
make <persName>Seguine </persName>[Seguin] and others of the most <persName>respectable citizens</persName> to
sweep the <placeName>public square</placeName>, and in case he whiped us, to make their <persName>Ladies</persName>,
grind tortias for his <persName>soldiers</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Should you concur with us, and determine to occupy the position above,
inform us of it, that we may co-operate with you, and wind up the job
speedily</p>

<p><persName>James Bowie </persName>[Rubric]</p>
<p><persName>J. W. Fannin Jr. </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>P. S. Fowd- to us our portion of the supplies, as we have prospect, but
from our private resources&#8212;also the <persName>men belonging to the Companies of
this Division who were <placeName>left behind</placeName></persName>&#8212;also request them to bring forwd- the
Baggage of their respective <persName>companies</persName></p>
