<p>Dr. Sir,</p>

<p>I expect you have heard from <persName>Mr. Jones of <placeName>Kaskaskea</placeName></persName> by <persName>Mr. 
Pascall a French Gentm from <persName>St. Geneveve</persName></persName> destenated for <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,
Agreeable to what last pased between us respectg the <placeName>Louisiany
Country</placeName>, I went and Exploared, untill no probability of meeting of
Success in that which was the object of my Journey to that Country,
Returning without seeing any thing that I conceived would by any
means Just [if] y an undertakeing of the kind,&#8212;I met with every 
incouragement from the People that was within the Scope of their
power, but not of Situation or Mineral,&#8212;I agreed provided there
should be such a Situation Discovered that would Justify as before,
That a Memorial might be laid in for me, and provided it Came 
forward in time, That I then would come forward as before proposed&#8212;
But time Runs so long with out hearing anything from that quarter,
and the Very great uncertainty of such a Discovery that I shall be
oblidged to make Other Arangement, I nevertheless should be glad
to hold an Interest with You in the Lead business, Provided I can
do it on agreeable an[d] Equaleable Turms, But should it not meet
Your Interest or inclenation, for me to hold any part of the Lead,
without pursuing the Iron Business, I shall decline any thing of that
kind, for the reasons before stated, I should be glad to hear from You,</p>

<p><persName>Wm. Shreve  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Moses   Austin   Esqr. </persName>  or   <persName>Stephen   Austin   Mercht.</persName></p>

<p>[Endorsed:]<date n="06-xx-1797"> June 1797 </date>  <persName>William Shreve</persName>   this letter is in Answer
to a Conditional contract made with said <persName>Shreve </persName>in consequence of
which the business contemplated under said contract was relinquishd</p>
