<p>[Indorsed by Austin: Ansd Feb 28.]</p>

<p>A. C. Taylor to Austin</p>

<p><placeName>Rushville, Schuyler Co Illinois</placeName></p>

<p><date when="1831-02-19">Feb. 19, 1831.</date></p>
<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>Without the honor of being known to you, I have flattered myself
that the nature of the subject of this communication will be some
excuse for the liberty I have taken in trespassing a few moments on
your attention.</p>

<p>There are in this vicinity, a number of <persName>families </persName>who are desirous
of removing to a <placeName>southern climate</placeName>; and on my suggesting to them that
the country of the <placeName>Texas </placeName>afforded very considerable inducements,
I have been requested to procure, if possible, further, and more
recent information in regard to that <placeName>country</placeName>. I have therefore been
induced to solicit this information, sir from you, not being 
acquainted with any person resident in that <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>We are apprised that it has heretofore been the practice to give to
every actual <persName>settler </persName>a certain quantity of land&#8212;we would be glad
to know whether this practice is still continued&#8212;<hi rend="italic">in your own tract
of <placeName>country </placeName></hi>and if not, whether it is the case in other parts of the
<placeName>country</placeName>, and if so what quantity of land is now given and what will<pb n="598"/>
be the expense of procuring the deed and the survey, and whether
there are good and convenient <placeName>tracts of country</placeName> yet unappropriated.
If land is not given at this time in any part of the <placeName>province</placeName>, on what
terms can it be purchased ?&#8212;What is the face of the <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;how
watered, and how furnished with building materials? What are the
advantages in a commercial point of view and what are the 
productions of the <placeName>country</placeName>? What are the religious priveleges&#8212;-are there
many wealthy <persName>inhabitants</persName>&#8212;and is slavery now tolerated ?&#8212;All 
accounts that we have received concur in representing the <placeName>country </placeName>as
healthy, still I should be glad to know what encouragement a 
<persName>physician </persName>would be likely to meet with.</p>

<p>I have acquainted myself pretty extensively with the culture and
manufacture of the grape, and have had some practical experience in
that business, I am therefore anxious to know whether the soil and
climate of <placeName>Texas </placeName>is adapted to its successful cultivation, I should be
glad also to be informed whether as yet the silk-worm has been 
introduced into the <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>Some with whom I have conversed on the subject of removing
have expressed fears in regard to the <persName>indians</persName>&#8212;please to say 
something in dissipation of such fears, if they are groundless.</p>

<p>There are about a Dozen <persName>families </persName>here who will probably remove
<date n="Fall-1831">next fall</date> if satisfied in regard to the state and coditions of the
<placeName>country</placeName>, and many more will remove the following season if pleased
with their accounts of the <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>Please to send us, if convenient, a copy of the constitution of your
general government, and one for the <placeName>province</placeName>, if you have a separate
constitution, as we do in the <placeName>States</placeName>; and also a copy of your code
of laws, as those interested, are anxious to obtain all the information
possible in regard to your civil institutions.</p>

<p>The above, together with any other information, whether written
or <hi rend="italic">printed </hi>you may please to send us? will be thankfully received
as a very special favor by</p>

<p><persName>A. C. Taylor  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Col. &#8212;&#8212; Austin</persName></p>

<p>P. S. I do not know the regulations of the<placeName> Post office</placeName>, but any 
expenses incurred in that line will be very cheerfully met by</p>

<p><persName>A. C. T</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] Col. Austin, of <placeName>Austin Town St, Philip de Austin
Texas</placeName></p>
