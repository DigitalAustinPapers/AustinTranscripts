<p>Sir by this safe oppertunity I must trouble you with another 
letter as I have wrote to you so often respecting my <placeName>Land</placeName>, and other
things: I requested you in several of my letters to you to write me
a few lines respecting my Land, if you received my Last letter which
I think was dated sometime in <date n="04-xx-1825">April </date>I expressed greate uneasiness
about my Land from a letter I had just received from <persName>Mr. Lynch</persName>
stating that you had givin away my <placeName>Labbour</placeName>,&#8212;and he gave me no
positive answer respecting by League which I could not conceive
how that could be the Case as you entered my <placeName>Labbour </placeName>in <date n="07-xx-1824">July </date>last
in my name and told me it should be secure to me and named in the
same title with my League&#8212;and I had all ways undeistood by <persName>Mr
Lynch</persName> that my title was safe in the <placeName>office </placeName>I have received a letter
since from <persName>mr, Lynch</persName> by the hand of <persName>Mr. Aulsbury</persName> that gave me
more satisfaction respecting it he informed me that my <placeName>League </placeName>was
safe and a first rate one by your own information and my <placeName>Labbour</placeName>
had been taken through mistake, which Can be All rectifyed when
I come on which will be amediately, <persName>Mr, Aulsbuy</persName> and his <persName>familey</persName>

<p>I kneede not write aney thing of the knews of this <placeName>Country </placeName>as <persName>Mr,
Cable</persName> will hand you this letter himself directly from this <placeName>place</placeName>: You
Can ask him what difficulties I have in Countered and what Losses
1 have sustained in trying to git to my Land in that <placeName>Country </placeName>which
I hope to afect in next <date n="06-xx-1825">month </date>without some unavoidable accident&#8212;I
