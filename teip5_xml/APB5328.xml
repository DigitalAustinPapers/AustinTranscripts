<p><placeName>Columbia Texas</placeName>: <date when="1836-12-07">Decr. 7. 1836</date></p>

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Permit me as briefly as may be&#8212;to submit to you the following 
Circumstances and facts relative to the Emigration of Myself and <persName>family </persName>and little
<placeName>Colony </placeName>to <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;To Wit,</p>

<p>1.&#8212;Before	we left <placeName>N. York</placeName>, I occupied nearly 2 years in diligent 
exertions for the benefit of <placeName>Texas</placeName>:&#8212;1st. In publishing, in various <placeName>News Papers</placeName>
all the valuable information which had ever appeared on the subject, with
many original communications: which, and with a variety of incidental
Expenses, in reference to my <persName>families</persName>, cost me more than $200.</p>

<p>2.&#8212;I	have been the direct <persName>Agent </persName>of sending here at least 20 <persName>Volunteers</persName>&#8212;
probably more.-</p>

<p>3.&#8212;Also,	20, or 25 <persName>Families</persName>; besides those (15) last which I brought
with me.-</p>

<p>4.	We should all have been in <placeName>Texas </placeName>by the <date when="1836-04-01">1st. of April, last</date>;&#8212;but for
the unavoidable Delays; etc, on account of the unsettled state of the 
<placeName>Country</placeName>, having been <hi rend="italic">advised </hi>to remain etc&#8212;</p>

<p>5.&#8212;We	have all&#8212;generally&#8212;suffered most severely from <hi rend="italic">Sickness</hi>, and
from want of <hi rend="italic">employment Sufficient</hi> to <hi rend="italic">sustain </hi>ourselves:&#8212;so that,&#8212;</p>

<p>6.&#8212;Of	our whole Number, 5 have Died (viz 2 <persName>children </persName>and 3 <persName>men</persName>, <persName>Heads
of Families</persName>; 2 of whom left <persName>Widows </persName>with <persName>Children</persName>.) 1. <persName>Mrs. Kent</persName>, (a<pb n="471"/>
most valuable young family:)&#8212;has no <persName>children</persName>. (What can be done
for her?)</p>

<p>7.&#8212;Hence,	in sustaining myself and family, and <persName>Colonists</persName>, during our
long <hi rend="italic">detention </hi>my <hi rend="italic">Expenses </hi>have exceeded $1.800-</p>

<p>8.&#8212;Nevertheless,	the <hi rend="italic">remains </hi>of my <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;together with my own
<persName>Family </persName>I shall be able to bring into <placeName>Texas</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>;&#8212;<hi rend="italic">that is,</hi> as soon
as I can go and return from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>; <hi rend="italic">they all</hi> being prepared on the
shortest notice: <hi rend="italic">Provided</hi>, I can <hi rend="italic">now ascertain where to locate them.</hi></p>

<p>9.	as soon as I can bring into <placeName>Texas </placeName>those of my <placeName>Colony </placeName>who are now
<hi rend="italic">in </hi>and <hi rend="italic">about </hi><placeName>N: Orleans</placeName>, I can, If necessary&#8212;Very soon make up the
Number who have been removed by Death &amp;c as follows:&#8212;2 <persName>families </persName>now
in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, living near <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>; and have been there for some time,
awaiting our Location in order to join us; who did not, originally, belong
to my present <placeName>Colony</placeName>; and whom I sent on nearly 1 year ago:&#8212;and 21y&#8212;
at least 100 <persName>Families </persName>of good character, enterprising, and of <hi rend="italic">property 
</hi>sufficient to bear their own Expenses here, and also, to <hi rend="italic">buy </hi>their own <hi rend="italic">Land</hi>, 
residing in the <placeName>Western parts of New York</placeName>, who are <hi rend="italic">ready </hi>and <hi rend="italic">anxious </hi>to join
us in <placeName>Texas</placeName>; and, <hi rend="italic">who will</hi> do so, the moment I <hi rend="italic">notify </hi>them that <hi rend="italic">we </hi>have
settled here, and are <hi rend="italic">pleased </hi>with the <placeName>Country</placeName>:&#8212; (This is&#8212;however, much
too <hi rend="italic">small </hi>an estimate:)</p>

<p>10.&#8212;The	"<persName>General Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, of the
Church in the <placeName>U States</placeName></persName>", have already made <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Texas </placeName></hi>a <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Missionary Station</placeName></hi>,
with a view to <hi rend="italic">my own appointment</hi> as their <hi rend="italic">Missionary</hi>: and which they
have likewise <hi rend="italic">Resolved </hi>to do, <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as I shall be <hi rend="italic">Located </hi>in the <placeName>Country</placeName>
and <hi rend="italic">actually engaged</hi> in my Professional duties.</p>

<p>11.&#8212;Therefore, our immediate <hi rend="italic">Settlement </hi>in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, is <hi rend="italic">all-important&#8212;</hi>
in regard to the <hi rend="italic">interests and welfare&#8212;of my self and <persName>family</persName>;</hi> and, indeed
a <hi rend="italic">failure </hi>to do so,&#8212;after our severe trials and great <hi rend="italic">Expenses</hi>&#8212;would be
direct and total <hi rend="italic">ruin to us all!</hi></p>

<p>12.&#8212;Finally&#8212;notwithstanding	the above facts and circumstances&#8212;[if]
I have, thus far, been of any valuable service to <placeName>Texas</placeName>,&#8212;I rejoice; and I
shall still be happy to render her any benefit in my power; either 
Professionally or otherwise; looking for no other reward, than to be allowed to
Locate my own family and the other <persName>families </persName>with me, agreeably to the
Terms of my Original Contract with you of Nov. 28, 1833.</p>

<p>13.&#8212;The whole <hi rend="italic">Expense</hi>, which I have incurred in regard to my <placeName>Colony</placeName>,
up to the present time, <hi rend="italic">exceeds </hi>$4,500.</p>

<p>14.	Finally; let me entreat you&#8212;(such is the divided state of public
opinion here:&#8212;so many different &amp; conflicting <hi rend="italic">interests </hi>and, so numerous,
unreasonable, and <hi rend="italic">contradictory </hi>are the <hi rend="italic">Interpretations </hi>given&#8212;even by our
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Legislators</persName></hi>&#8212;to the <hi rend="italic">Colonization Laws</hi>,&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Let me entreat you</hi>, respectfully
and most earnestly, to explain to me the <hi rend="italic">real facts</hi> and circumstances of the<pb n="472"/>
case, regarding the <hi rend="italic">Location </hi>of <hi rend="italic">my own</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Families </persName></hi>with me, 
agreeably to those Laws, in the 1st. place; and 21y&#8212;What <hi rend="italic">you, yourself</hi>, will be
able to <hi rend="italic">do for us</hi>,&#8212;if anything: <hi rend="italic">Lastly</hi>: what <hi rend="italic">I had best do</hi> situated as I
<hi rend="italic">now </hi>am?____________&amp;c &amp;c&#8212;I am Dr Sir, with great Respect,</p>

<p><persName>R. Salmon</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] To Whom it May Concern <hi rend="italic"><persName>Genl. Austin</persName></hi>....<placeName>Texas</placeName></p>
