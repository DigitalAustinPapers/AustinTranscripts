<p>I got down to <placeName>pleasant buyou</placeName> all safe <date when="1831-11-11">a week ago</date> and have selected a<placeName> building spot </placeName>a little below where we camped it is<placeName> below the head
of tide</placeName> and at high tide the watter is a little brackish but there is a
good stream of fresh watter now and by buildg a <placeName>small dam</placeName> say about
2 or 2 1/2 feet high it will keep out the tide and the situation I think
is much preferable to any above and will be geting nigher to 
navigation which I think is desirable. I have come here with the waggon
for some articles we Wanted I left <persName>Kenner </persName>and the other <persName>boys </persName>at
work and if the <placeName>saw mill</placeName> goes on any reasonable time I hope it will
not be very long before we will be prepared to bring the <persName>famaly</persName>
down. I expect to get on ... . ploughs started next week&#8212;
or the week after. I was at <persName>Capn H Austin</persName>s as I came here Saw
<persName>Mrs. Holly </persName>she is very desirous to see you before she returns (as
by her engagements she is compelled to do) and would be very glad
if the dearbourne could be sent down for her I have wrote to
<persName>Emily </persName>if <persName>Joel </persName>has got well enough to ventur out to send him for her
and if he is not perhapes you could get one of the young men at
<placeName><persName>Williams</persName></placeName> to go down for her She expects to return by the next
vessel</p>

<p>As I passed <placeName><persName>Majr Hall</persName>s</placeName> yesterday I saw <persName>Doc Phelps</persName>&#8212;and from
what I here I think it is proble they will settle there deficulty and
in that case it is very proble <persName>Hall </persName>will apply for some of the<placeName> Clear
Creek land </placeName>I would like to see you before you give him a promise
of any . . . for . . . very much prepared a <placeName>farm </placeName>. . . the boy 
notwithstanding . . . was still very plenty on <placeName>pleasant bayou</placeName> when I <pb n="708"/>
left there by a <persName>traveler </persName>just from <placeName>San Philipe</placeName> I hear you are still
on the recovery and against I see you which will not be for some
time yet that you will entirely be recoverd your health. I have heard
<persName>Genr Teran</persName> has arivd at <placeName>Galveston</placeName></p>
