<p><placeName>Harrisburgh </placeName><date when="1832-10-03">Octr. the 3rd 1832</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>From Various Circumstances, I have concluded to ask Your advice,
and opinion on some few subjects, and to be as concise as possible
I will remark, that this <persName>Jno. W. Moore</persName> (who I believe is a Greater
Tyrant and less a respecter of the Constitution and Laws than <persName>Col
Bradborn</persName>), has been persecuting and Slandering me, ever since a
short time after my Arrival at this <placeName>place</placeName>&#8212; I can trace to him the
Source of all my difficulties in <placeName>Harrisburgh</placeName>, which surpassed all I
ever witnessed before&#8212; He has industrously circulated <hi rend="italic">falsehoods</hi>,
in various ways respecting me, and prejudicial to my <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>and
<hi rend="italic">Interest</hi>. He has not only made <hi rend="italic">false Statements</hi> injurious to me,
but he has gone so far as to swear to them<pb n="869"/></p>

<p>This last he has managed so ingeniously, that I cant prove it on
him.&#8212;</p>

<p>He refuses to respect me as a <persName>Physician </persName>not withstanding, upon
a personal Examination by the <persName>Medical Board</persName>, I obtained a License,
and he refuses to give Judgments allowing anything&#8212;for my Medicine and Service</p>

<p>He tells <persName><hi rend="italic">people </hi></persName>that I am not a <persName><hi rend="italic">Physician </hi></persName>But applies to me the
Vulgar Term <persName>Quack</persName>&#8212;so I am Creditably informed, for he never
has said it to me&#8212; This accusation is <hi rend="italic">false</hi>, and made use of to
injure me&#8212; I consider myself able to prove to any <persName>Judges </persName>the
Contrary&#8212;</p>

<p>By his <hi rend="italic">Intrigue </hi>and Management I have been unable to collect
my <hi rend="italic">Debts </hi>here In no Case whatever have I had a fair chance, to
obtain Justice, He has chosen my Absence, and without giving me
notice to try all my Cases, He has called upon <persName>Men </persName>whom he could
sway as he pleased to Arbetrate&#8212; And I can safely say&#8212;before
him I have never had Justice done me&#8212;</p>

<p>All This has resulted from the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, that I would not sanction
his <hi rend="italic">Unjust Measures</hi>, Nor suffer myself to be made his <hi rend="italic">Toot</hi>&#8212; To
remain in this condition is more Intolerable than <hi rend="italic">Banishment</hi>
<hi rend="italic">Itself</hi>&#8212; How to proceed I am at a loss, And Your Advice I hope to
obtain.</p>

<p>On reflection, There occurs to my mind, Three modes of redress&#8212;.
and which to choose I am unable to Determine</p>

<p>First a <hi rend="italic">Suit </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Slander </hi>&#8212;The law on that Subject, in this
<persName>Country</persName>, I am unacquainted with, &#8212;And should the letter of the
law even be favourable to me, what chance I might have to obtain
Justice, Under present circumstances I dont know&#8212;,</p>

<p>Second, To call on him, to give Satisfaction at the <hi rend="italic">Mouth </hi>of a
<hi rend="italic">Pistol </hi>&#8212;This I have two important objections to&#8212;first I am
seriously opposed to it by principle&#8212;And second, I have a <persName>family</persName>-
should, I happen to be <hi rend="italic">killed </hi>who would be left destitute, in a
<placeName>country</placeName>, without <persName>Friends</persName>&#8212;And I might add a third in relation to
him, did we live in a <placeName>Country</placeName>, where men were respected agreeably
to their real merits&#8212;and where we were both known, I should&#8212;-
most certainly refuse to <hi rend="italic">Notice him</hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>A third mode presents itself&#8212;which is. To leave the <placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212;.
This I have more objections to than the Second&#8212;That Course would
give Credence (here at least) to his Slanderous&#8212;and&#8212;-<hi rend="italic">false reports</hi>
And <hi rend="italic">Death </hi>Sir would be more desirable to me.</p>

<p>I must believe, if you&#8212;and <persName>Capt. <hi rend="italic">Jno Austin</hi></persName> and the respectable
<persName>Gentlemen in General in the <placeName>Country</placeName>,</persName> were in possession of the
truths on the subject, that you and They would enlist your Interest
in behalf of Justice&#8212;<pb n="870"/></p>

<p>I have choosen you as my <persName>first adviser</persName> in this matter, for the
reasons&#8212;That I believe if you will give advice in the Case at all
That it may be depended on&#8212;and I flatter myself that you Will
from your previous Friendship&#8212;and your knowledge of My-&#8212;
<persName>Father In Law</persName>&#8212;whom I look for here again this <date n="Winter - 1832">winter</date>&#8212;and
from my opinion of your desire to resent oppression&#8212;</p>

<p>Whatever Advice you may choose to give I assure You, by me
shall be used according to your directions&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>J. G. Weight</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin </persName> <placeName> St Felippi</placeName></p>
