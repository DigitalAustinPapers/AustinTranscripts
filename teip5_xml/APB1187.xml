<p>Dr Sir, If you will recollect when we were talking about the
division of the <placeName>47th league of land</placeName> granted to <persName>Tom </persName>and Myself;
You said that I was to have first choice <persName>Ingrim </persName>and <persName>Mr. S. Williams</persName>
were present and it was a fair and clear understanding between us
that I was to have the prefference; the <placeName>lower half of said league</placeName> is
my choice; but have understood that <persName>Tom </persName>has made a transfer of the
<placeName>upper half</placeName> to me: But when you call to recollection the conversation
that took place between us I am in hopes you will have the transfer
altered and let me have the <placeName>lower half</placeName> agreeable to the understanding
 that existed between us&#8212;The expences accruing in altering the<pb n="1368"/>
transfer I will pay.&#8212;<persName>Tom </persName>has repeatedly observed that he would
as soon have <placeName>one half as the other </placeName>and as I am willing to pay the
charge requisite in altering the transfer I hope it is a matter of
indifference with you</p>

<p><persName>Thomas Jamison</persName></p>
<p><persName>N. B</persName>.</p>

<p>pleas inform me on the subject by <persName>Mr. Deckrow</persName> I have told you
as much about my making choice as ever I did <persName>Tom </persName>or any other
person, from the statement made to me by <persName>Selkirk </persName>and <persName>Tom </persName>himself,
I expected I would take the <placeName>upper half</placeName> but upon taking a view of it
myself I prefer the <placeName>lower half</placeName>, and <persName>Tom </persName>still says it is a matter of
indifference with him. As for the improvement <persName>Tom </persName>claims I do not
consider he has a greater claim to the improvement than I have for
two thirds of the improvement was made by <persName>Morrison </persName>and <persName>McCoy</persName>
who asked my permission to plant corn on sd- Land&#8212;I have a Crop
now on the <placeName>lower half</placeName> and am building a House on same; which will
be completed in three or four days.&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Tom </persName>nor no other person has ever called on me to make my choice</p>

<p><persName>Thomas Jamison</persName></p>

<p><persName>Col° S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>N. B. The above stated improvement made by <persName>Morrison McCoy
</persName>and <persName>Tom </persName>was made before the deed came out</p>

<p><persName>T. Jamison</persName></p>
