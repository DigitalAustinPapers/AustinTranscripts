<p>I purchased <placeName>three eleven league tracts</placeName> of <persName>Aguirrie of <placeName>Saltillo</placeName></persName>. The power
of attorney to take possession of this land and sell it was given to <persName>Wil-<pb n="287"/>
liams</persName> by <persName>Aguirrie</persName>. Of these tracts one was sold to <persName>Mr. St John</persName> by 
<persName>Williams </persName>with my consent. One was sold to <persName>John Austin</persName> without my consent
and one still belongs to me and was located by me <placeName>on the east side of 
Colorado at the foot of the mountains</placeName> surveyed by <persName>Fernando Rodriguiz</persName> which
I paid him for and left with <persName>Williams</persName>. All these things will be fairly stated
and settled by <persName>Williams</persName>, I have no doubt. I wish you to attend to it all
and all my business as well as you can, but not to involve yourself in any
way in any of my affairs. I gave <persName>Austin Bryan</persName> a note on James H. Bell (I
think that is his name) for fifteen cows and calves to be delivered at his
<placeName>home </placeName><placeName>nearly opposite San Felipe</placeName> on the <date when="1836-04-15">15 April next</date>. Drive them to
<placeName>Chocolate</placeName>. I indorced the note to be credited in my a/c for money 
advanced by you for me when in <placeName>mexico</placeName>.</p>

<p>I wish the title for the <placeName>land </placeName>belonging to me that is in my <persName>brother</persName>s name
which I purchased from others, transfered to me by order of <persName>court</persName>, as soon
as it can be done My part of the <placeName>matagorda tract</placeName> is one of them, which I
got from <persName>Whiteman </persName>[Wightman] by exchanging other land for it.</p>

<p>I wish to adopt <persName>Stephen F. (my brothers son)</persName> and that he should be
delivered up to me, to be dealt by as my own <persName>son</persName>.</p>

<p>I wish you to make titles in my name for the <persName>Brasoria lots</persName> that have
been sold.</p>

<p><date when="1835-12-17">Dec.r 17. 1835</date>	<persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>As regards the <persName>upper colony</persName>&#8212;I have never yet rec'd. one cent. I have
had nothing to do with it. My name has been used for the benifit of others
and I have rec'd. all the abuse and calumny. <persName>Williams </persName>knows all about it.</p>
