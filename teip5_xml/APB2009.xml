<p>[May &#8212;, 1825.]</p>
<p>Dr <persName>Sister</persName>,</p>

<p>I  have lately recd instructions from the <persName>Govt </persName>to attend to the
<placeName>Settlement </placeName>of five hundred <persName>families </persName>more in this <placeName>country </placeName>and shall
set about it immediately&#8212;this renders it impossible for me to think<pb n="1109"/>
of visiting <placeName>Missouri </placeName>for some years to come and besides&#8212; it will
be a long time before I can raise the means of going there as I
wish&#8212;my labors in this <placeName>country </placeName>altho arduous and in every way
perplexing will not yield me anything for some years and then
not the fortune which some have supposed&#8212;I shall benefit others
much more than myself in proportion&#8212; but thank heaven I am
not avericious&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish you [to] ask the advice of <persName>Barton Ed Bates</persName>, <persName>John Scott</persName>,
and other <persName>Lawyers </persName>relative to the <placeName>mine a Burton property</placeName> and
make any bargain with them you think proper, except as to 
engaging Money&#8212;I can pay no money now or for several years to
come&#8212;if they will undertake it for an interest of the property I
am agreed to give up an interest&#8212; do as you please but delay no
time&#8212;</p>

<p>Also take their advice relative to the <placeName>Little Rock property</placeName> and
have suit commenced on that without delay, and give them an 
interest in that also&#8212; You are the proper person to attend to that
business&#8212; and do not delay anytime&#8212; See what can be done
immediately.&#8212;</p>

<p>Send on from the <persName>Lawyers </persName>the form of a power of attorney for
<persName>brother </persName>and me to sign and instruction how it must be 
authenticated&#8212; it is a long distance to the<placeName> seat of Govt</placeName> to have it executed
before the <persName>Govr </persName>and I am myself the <persName>highest civil authority</persName>, <placeName>this
side the seat of Govt</placeName> there are <persName>justices of the peace</persName> here, called
<persName>Alcaldes </persName>before whom it might be executed&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Brother </persName>started a few days ago to <placeName>San Antonia</placeName> and will be
absent about six weeks&#8212; I have nothing new&#8212;The Season has
been very wet so far&#8212;too much so&#8212;tho the crops are very good&#8212;<persName>Mr
Green DeWitt</persName> I am told has obtained permission for the 
Settlement of <persName>400 families </persName>from <placeName>Missouri </placeName>on a River in this Province
called the <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName><placeName>about 70 miles west of this</placeName>&#8212;it is a fine country,
very well waterd and very healthy&#8212;he will be on shortly from
the <placeName>interior </placeName>and I will write by him&#8212; in the meantime see the
<persName>lawyers </persName>and set about the <placeName>Mine a Burton property</placeName> without delay
and also the <placeName>Little Rock</placeName> business you need not wait for me&#8212; it
will be four or five years at least before I shall have the means of
going to <placeName>Missouri</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Remember me to <persName>Mr Perry</persName> and the <persName>children </persName>and write often to
your</p>

<p>ever affectionate <persName>brother</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
