<p><placeName>St Louis</placeName> <date when="1807-05-30">May 30, 1807.</date></p>
<p>To Messrs. <persName>Elisha Baker</persName>
<persName>Moses Austin</persName>
<persName>Darius Shaw</persName> and
<persName>Joseph Whittlesey</persName></p>

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>When I had the pleasure of seeing you at <placeName>St Louis</placeName>, you presented
me a Paper containing an association of <persName>67 Individuals</persName> as a <placeName>Military
School</placeName>; and desired, on their behalf an establishment of the said
association, on the principles under which the society was first
founded.&#8212; You also tender your services to the <persName>President of the
<placeName>U. States</placeName></persName>, under the law authorizing him to accept of <persName>volunteer 
companies</persName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>During our conversation it did not occur to me, that you had 
neglected to nominate your <persName>officers</persName>, and in a subsequent interview with
<persName>Mr Austin</persName>, I remarked to him this omission.&#8212;</p>

<p>At that time, the law had not been officially communicated, and I
had erroneously imagined that the <persName>President </persName>would make the 
appointments, in conformity with the Recommendations of the 
<persName>Company</persName>.&#8212; But the enclosed Proclan will inform you of the conditions
under which he will accept your offers, and the Manner in which the
commissions will issue.<pb n="127"/></p>

<p>If the terms are such as cannot be acceded to on your part, it is
yet in your power to withhold yourselves from the service. But if
you are still anxious to make a display of your patriotic dispositions
in this way, I must beg you without unnecessary delay to transmit
to me the names of those <persName>officers </persName>who would be acceptable to you.</p>

<p>As to <persName>volunteer companies</persName> generally, I am willing as an individual
<persName>Public Agent</persName>, to express to you my most cordial approbation of
them.&#8212;The <persName>Militia </persName>law is at this time under revision, and if my
private wishes should not be overruled by legislative interposition, I
hope shortly to see <persName>volunteer companies</persName>, for the defence of the 
<placeName>territory </placeName>merely, without being compelled to march out of it, both of
<persName>Cavalry</persName>, <persName>Artillery </persName>and <persName>Riflemen</persName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>I enclose the Law as well as the Procln and hope you will do me
the favor of making them both public</p>

<p><persName>F. Bates.</persName></p>

<p>You will also oblige me by putting up in conspicuous Places the
enclosing advertisements on the subject of Land Claims.&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] Messrs <persName>Elisha Baker</persName>, <persName>Moses Austin</persName>, <persName>Darius Shaw</persName>
and <persName>Jos Whittlesey</persName> <placeName>Mine a Burton</placeName></p>

<p>[Endorsed:] <persName>Fred Bates Secy Territory <placeName>Saint Loui</placeName>s</persName> <date when="1807-05-30">May 30 1807</date></p>
