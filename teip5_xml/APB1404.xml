<p>To <persName>S. F. Austin Esqr</persName></p>

<p><persName>Empresario of the Colony</persName> of his name consisting of <persName>three hundred
families </persName>and also of a <placeName>new Colony</placeName> of <persName>five hundred families </persName>in the
<placeName>Department of Texas</placeName> <persName>Byrd Lockhart</persName> late of the <placeName>State of Missouri
</placeName><placeName>United States of the North</placeName>, represents: That being desirous to settle
himself in this <placeName>department</placeName>; to cultivate the <placeName>Earth </placeName>by agricultureal
pursuit and also to introduce stock and promote the raising and
multiplication thereof&#8212;</p>

<p>He therefore Petitions you to reserve <placeName>one League of land</placeName> for him
situated on the <placeName>East side of the Rio La Vaca;</placeName> and it being the second
League <placeName>below the one Surveyed by <persName>Mr. James Kerr</persName> for <persName>Robert
Guthrie</persName></placeName>&#8212;Your <persName>Petitioner </persName>is aware that the above League is within<pb n="1655"/>
the <placeName>ten litteral Leagues</placeName> reserved by the Government, but he is under
the impression that you will shortly be authorized to settle said 
reserve, in which ease your <persName>petitioner </persName>hopes you will permit him to
occupy, improve and cultivate said League agreeable to the provisions
of the Colonization Law.</p>

<p>Your <persName>petitioner </persName>further represents that he has several <persName>relations</persName>
and <persName>friends </persName>who are desirous to emigrate to this <placeName>Department </placeName>and
who he believes are honest and industrious <persName>Citizens</persName>: and as the only
convenient way for them to remove their <persName>families </persName>and effects to the
<placeName>Country </placeName>is by water, they will necessarily bring a years provisions
with them.&#8212; It is obvious therefore that they will for a while be
confined <placeName>near the ship landing</placeName> and in order to facilitate them in the
ardious undertaking of migrating hither your <persName>petitioner </persName>prays that
you will be pleased to permit him to select <placeName>one League of Land on
the Navidad</placeName> and <placeName>opposite or nearly so to <persName>Mr. Kerr</persName>'s League on the
La Vaca</placeName> for the purpose of making a dense and Strong Settlement
by dividing said League of Land among Said <persName>emigrants</persName>:&#8212;And
your <persName>Petitioner </persName>as in duty bound will ever pray</p>

<p><persName>Byrd Lockhart</persName></p>

<p><placeName>Lavaca </placeName><date when="1827-06-03">3d June 1827</date></p>

<p>It gives us pleasure to state that we have long been acquainted
with the above <persName>petitioner Capt Bjrd Lockhart</persName>; that his character
has ever been that of a <persName>Gentleman </persName>in the first circles: he has 
always been remarkable for his industry, perseverance, and 
integrity .-&#8212;Should it be in the power of <persName>Col. Austin</persName> to admit his petition
we feel no hesitation in saying that the <persName>Colonel </persName>will find the 
<persName>petitioner </persName>to be a man of the utmost utility in forming a <placeName>new Settlement
</placeName>and a valuable <persName>Citizen </persName>also to furnish to us a <persName>neighbor </persName>with whom
we shall all find pleasure.</p>
