<p>D Sir; Those to whom I have talked with relative to the claims
You have against them for what may be owed on their <placeName>lands </placeName>
consider it high time they were paid; But you know Where long
indulgence is given and a long laps of time taken place without any
demand a great many all most conclude the debt is paid. According
to My opinion the most expeditious way of getting or collecting your
claims would be to make a demand of each ones debt; if so those who
are oweing Will begin to make preparations to discharge what they
owe; You Know the nature of a great many for so long as they can
get indulgence so long will they refrain from paying I am well
apprised that there is very little money but if such property as they
have will suit you at Cash valuation&#8212;I have but little doubt but
most of them would pay&#8212; Any assistance I can give you in that
way I will Cherfully do it I am thankful to you for having the
error in the deed from <persName>Selkirk </persName>to Me rectified and whatever expences
accruing from the same You will please let me Know&#8212; In 
consequence of the flys continueing so long I could not start as soon as I
would but before long I will take the Mules due you to <placeName>San Felipe de
Austin</placeName>   Yours with Esteem</p>

<p><persName>Ay. C. Buckner</persName></p>


<p>In conversation with some I have taken the liberty of saying it
would be better [to] pay as soon as possible otherwise they would
perhaps be compelled to do it,&#8212;and with cost to the <persName>debtor </persName>(some
require it)</p>
