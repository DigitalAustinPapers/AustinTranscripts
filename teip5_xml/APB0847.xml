<p><placeName>Woodville [Mississippi]</placeName> <date when="1824-09-02">Sept. 2nd 1824</date>.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p><persName>Mr George Huff</persName>, who is the <persName>bearer </persName>of this letter to you, is a 
<persName>BlackSmith </persName>by trade&#8212;and a mecanic of the first order&#8212;For the last eight
years he has done, I may say, all my <placeName>plantation </placeName>work in the best
order&#8212;He goes to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, at my solicitation, for the purpose of 
viewing the country, and I hope on his arrival there you will have 
judgment enough to induce him, if possible, to move his <persName>family </persName>out&#8212;And
sir I take the liberty of saying to you that he is the <hi rend="italic">best </hi><persName>workman </persName>of
his trade in the <placeName>Western country</placeName>&#8212;(I make this expression without
exception) and that is not all, if <persName>Mr Huff</persName>, should be pleased with the
country, which I hope he may, and should you hold out to him 
sufficient prospects to induce him, to move his <persName>family </persName>out&#8212;A <persName>Mr Joseph
Servison</persName> of this place will go with him, and be his <persName>partner</persName>&#8212;<persName>Mr 
Servison</persName> can do any thing in wood which relates to Machinery, either
in or out of water&#8212;On the Inclined plane or otherwise&#8212;You may<pb n="888"/>
rely on me as a <persName>man or Honor</persName>, that between those two <persName>mechanicks</persName>,
you could have any thing done, in the best order, either in Iron or
wood, which could be done in the <placeName>Western country</placeName>&#8212;In a word Sir,
I have been at some trouble to induce <persName>Mr Huff</persName>, to visit your 
country, and should he be pleased with it, and move his <persName>family</persName>, which
I  hope he will do, <persName>Mr Servison</persName> will go also, and then you will be
better off for <persName>mecanicks </persName>than we will be&#8212;Because they are the only
<persName>Tradesmen </persName>of their profession, which we have <hi rend="italic">ever had</hi> in this part
of the country worth naming&#8212;</p>

<p>And should you hold out sufficient inducements to <persName>Mr Huff</persName> to move
his <persName>family </persName>to that <placeName>country</placeName>, I think that I am authorized to say to
you that him and <persName>Mr Servison</persName> will be <persName>partners </persName>and be able to 
command funds here, to Erect <placeName>Cotton-Gins</placeName>&#8212;<placeName>Water-Mills</placeName>&#8212;and 
Machinery on the principle of the inclined plane and otherwise&#8212;</p>

<p>For several years, I have been devoted to your country; but 
having a young <persName>family</persName>; and being well situated here, I have thought
that it would be simple in me to move; but ultimately, I have 
determined to do so&#8212;Provided you will authorize me to bring out with
me from Ten to Twenty <persName>families</persName>, by way of forming a good <persName>female-
society</persName> at once, the only principle on which I can consent to move
my <persName>family </persName>at this time&#8212;The <persName>families </persName>who will go with me will be
both wealthy and respectable&#8212;Many of them my own relations and
connections.&#8212;<persName>Artizans </persName>and <persName>Mecanicks </persName>of the first order, will also
go with me&#8212;And should the <persName>Indians </persName>be troublesome, I should like
nothing better than to command against them and settle the 
question with them at once&#8212;I served with <persName>Genl Jackson</persName> many months
in that service, at his <placeName>head quarters</placeName>.&#8212;And if I know any thing it
[is] <persName>Indian</persName>-Warfare&#8212;<persName>Col. Child</persName> is absent on the <placeName>Eastern Circuit</placeName>
and of course can not send his respects to you; but I am authorized
to present [them] to you, which I hope you will except&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish you to write me my <persName>Mr Huff</persName> on the subject of your <placeName>Grant</placeName>
from the <persName>Mexican-Government</persName>, etc, its extent and your powers, etc,
&#8212;In a word a copy with your remarks to me, would enable me to
facilitate the businiss here&#8212;I wish you distinctly to understand, as
we have no personal acquaintance, that any thing, which I have said
to you is to be relied on.</p>

<p><persName>Wm Johnson</persName></p>

<p><persName>Honorable Stephen F. Austin</persName>.</p>
