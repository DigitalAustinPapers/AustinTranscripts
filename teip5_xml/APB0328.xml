<p>Dear Sir                                       <placeName>Potosi </placeName><date when="1819-03-10">March 10,1819</date></p>

<p>This will be handed to you by my Friend <persName>Doctor Robert Andrews</persName>,
with whom I have made an arrangement (subject to your 
confirmation), which I think will be for the mutual advantage of us all.</p>

<p><persName>Doctr. Andrews</persName> had it [in] contemplation to locate a place with in
four miles of our <placeName>Ouchitaw </placeName>location on the <placeName>Caddo River</placeName> where he 
intended to lay off <hi rend="italic">a Town</hi>, but declined it after we made ours altho he
thinks that a Town might be layed off there to advantage,&#8212;a Town
there would certainly interfere some with ours&#8212;I have therefore
agreed to let him become interested in our <placeName><hi rend="italic">Ouchitaw </hi></placeName>location <hi rend="italic">one
Eighth </hi>by his paying that porportion of the cost of the claim in twelve
months&#8212; and also in consideration of his agreeing to go immediately
down to that country (with authority from <persName>Genl Rector</persName> to survey
the claims if he will give it) and to survey all our locations, lay off the
Town at the <placeName>Little Rock</placeName>, at the <persName>Ouchitaw </persName>and on <persName>Red River</persName></p>

<p>he is fully competent to this business and it will be some object for
us to have our Towns in Market <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>&#8212;the contract I have
made is to let him be interested one Eighth in our <placeName>Ouchitaw </placeName>location
as above stated&#8212;give him two lots if he draws, or one if he chooses it,
in the <placeName><hi rend="italic">Little Rock</hi> Town</placeName>&#8212; this contract however is subject to your
sanction, or rejection, as I think if he becomes interested, we aught
<hi rend="italic">both </hi>to relinquish a part as it will be for our joint benefit&#8212;if you
approve of the arrangement therefor you can take his note for the
Money and give <hi rend="italic">a Bond</hi> in our joint names, for the <hi rend="italic">title</hi>.</p>

<p>Make every exertion to get an order of survey and to get <persName>Andrews</persName>
appointed the <persName><hi rend="italic">Surveyor</hi></persName>&#8212;but do not let it be known that he is 
interested in the location,</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Mr. William M. O'hara</persName> <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>.</p>
