<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>It is with Regret I see so much confushion and Trouble in the
<placeName>Spanish Provences</placeName> But It can only a lone be attributed to The
Imperfect manner of the organization of the <persName>government</persName>&#8212;The 
<placeName>Districk of Nacogdoches</placeName> had Been Left Intirely to the management of
a few Ignorant Designing <persName>men </persName>without Principle and with out laws,
men who wished to show their Power and acted with more Tyranny
Then Ever was, Excersised under the <persName>king of spain</persName>. Love of change
and an Idia that Land could be obtained for a mear Trifle, and
others for crimes Done Caused a considerable Imigration To that
<placeName>country </placeName>Expecting or thinking It a <placeName>Republick </placeName>similar to the one they
had left and finding no Laws nor Regulation orthised by the 
<persName>government</persName>, and all Those that Pretended to act from orthority, without
Principle or Justice no wonder, that <persName>americans </persName>Eight from the<placeName> Land
of Liberty</placeName>, should wish a change Letters and addresses to the
<persName>government </persName>was never attended to, the mail Robed and no 
communication through that Depart could be Depended on, with a<pb n="1603"/>
thousand other causes, has led the Independent <persName>americans </persName>to Deeds
of violence That they would heave abhord, Provided the 
<persName>government </persName>could heave been properly organised so that they could heave
In joyed Peace and asshir anees for their Property&#8212;I Sir Removed
to that <placeName>country </placeName>from choice, and heave as much wright to complaine
as almost any other Person&#8212;I sir fell under the Displeasure of the
<persName>Petty Tayrant</persName> for Raising a <persName>company of volunteers</persName> by his own
Request to go to the assistance of your <placeName>Colony</placeName>, I was Denyed the
Priviledge of Taking oath of Eligence to the <persName>government</persName>, and when
I Purchesed <placeName>land </placeName>denyed the Right to hold land and could not heave
a Deed acnoledged, without any cause shewn I considered Those
Ingerys unorthised by the <persName>government </persName>and, was one of the Leading
causes of Puting the <persName>Rascal </persName>Down and appointing an other in his
Place that I thought would Do Justice&#8212;But as to Raising the Flag
I was opposed to It, and Done Every thing I could to git It Down&#8212;
I Refare you to my friend <persName>Capn Joseph Dust</persName> for Infermation as
he alone in that <placeName>Town </placeName>knew my Polocy and we acted togather&#8212;</p>

<p>as Respects the <persName>Prisnors </persName>they never Took an active Part against
The government they were in opposition to <persName>Norris &amp; Co&#8212;</persName> <persName>W.
Wilson</persName> in Particular is my friend (and a more manly Independant
man is not in that <placeName>Provence</placeName>) and he I assure you never approbated
the Raising the Flag nor would Ever Serve under It, and I hope
my <persName>friend </persName>you will Do Every thing you can for him as well as all
the Rest for should the <persName>Prisners </persName>be Put To Death there will be
Troubles In the <placeName>country </placeName>that you can heave but little Idea off</p>

<p>when the <persName>coms </persName>ware sent to make Peace The <persName>People </persName>on the <placeName>Aish
Bayou,</placeName> would gladly heave Imbraced the oppertunity with out, the
Trouble and Dappredations that has Been committed there by men
I fear without Principles or Honesty and whose Friendship or honor
can not be Relyed on I Proposed sending on a <persName>man </persName>to the 
government to Represent our situation, which would heave Ben done, If
the times had not heave changed as soon as they Did.</p>

<p>I left the <placeName>country </placeName>because I say that Peace could not be 
Established, untill the <persName>Troops </persName>would arrive and heave Rented Land for
this crop, with the Intention of Returning to the <placeName>country </placeName>as soon
as Times would Become Better&#8212;But hearing I am threatened as
one of the <persName>Promoters of the Rebellion</persName>, I shall not Return, untill
times can be Better Regulated,</p>

<p>I should be glad to see you and Think if I could or was orthised
That I could Bring the <persName>Party </persName>That is on this side to a compromise,
Provided They could be Pardoned for their offence, and I think all
But the <persName>Edwards </persName>would be glad to Return to that <placeName>country </placeName>Provided
they could Do It in Peace&#8212;I am settled  <placeName>20 miles from thesabine</placeName>
But would meet you There at any Time [desired] and I Do not Hesi-<pb n="1604"/>
tate in saying that [I can] Bring all the <persName>Party</persName>, (and There is near
30 men) to Terms of Peace Provided It is by your Request and
that of the <persName>officers of the army</persName> I should be glad you and your <persName>Brother</persName>
could come and spend a few Days with us. I could give you Every
Information on the subject and I Do assure will Do Every thing in
my Power to Establish Peace</p>

<p>Be assured I new you ay an old and particuler friend I wish you
helth and Hapiness</p>
