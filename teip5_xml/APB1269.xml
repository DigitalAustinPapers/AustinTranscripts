<p>Station On <placeName>Rio Labaca</placeName> <date when="1826-09-03">Sept 3rd 1826</date>.</p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>This will inform you I have stationed myself for the present on
this <placeName>creek </placeName> <placeName>a bout 6 miles above the head of tide water</placeName>, where I intend
settling some 10 or 12 <persName>families </persName>in the form of a station in order that
we may be more secure from the <persName>Indians </persName>untill we can collect strength
enough to venture out on our <placeName>lands</placeName>.</p>

<p>I should have written you before this time, but have been so 
undetermined in the place where I would actually settle for the present;
and so much occupied in moving out from the <placeName>bay </placeName>that I had not time
to write you, which neglect I hope you will pardon.</p>

<p>I have contracted for the runing of the Schooner Despatch, <persName>W. J.
Russell, master,</persName> for the term of 4 years&#8212;she has made her first trip;
and is a new vessel only 18 months old; burthen 50 Tons and well
Edged, I have also contracted for the building of a flat boat 30 by 12
feet, which is already begun; for which is for the purpose of unload-<pb n="1445"/>
ing and lighting the schooner so that she can pass in at the<placeName> mouth of
the Labaca</placeName>&#8212;the schooner will be at the <placeName>landing </placeName>a gain in about 3
weeks, with some <persName>Emigrants </persName>and [al]so some cargo for this <placeName>country</placeName>.
I have also contracted for the building of a <placeName>ware house</placeName> <placeName>at or near the
mouth of the Labaca</placeName> which will be immediately commenced for the
convenience of <persName>emigrants </persName>and others destined for either of these 
<placeName>colonies</placeName>, that their <persName>property </persName>and <persName>families </persName>may have a place of shelter and
safety on landing in this vast <placeName><hi rend="italic">wilderness</hi></placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Mr Kerr</persName> has just returned from <persName>San Antonio</persName> and will be able to
give you all the News of that place; touching my business with the
Government.</p>

<p>If you should write shortly to <persName>Baron De Bastrop</persName> I would wish to
be particularly remembered to him; inform him what I am doing etc
etc and that I will shortly write hiin lengthly,</p>

<p>When on my way to this <placeName>country </placeName>I called at landing of <placeName>Mr Elias
Bates</placeName> in order to ask for letters for you and your <persName>brother</persName>; but was
informed by <persName>Mr John Geizer</persName> that none of the <persName>family </persName>were at <placeName>home</placeName>
and that <persName>Mrs Bates</persName> and <persName>Mrs Honey</persName> were both dead.</p>

<p>I intend visiting you so soon as I can leave this place with safety,
when I shall have many things to say and much advice to ask of you,
as <persName>Empresarios </persName>have much trouble to en counter, but I the most of
all; your assistance to <persName>Mr Kerr</persName> has been deeply felt by him and
equally so by me.   My compliments to <persName>Mr Williams</persName></p>

<p><persName>G. Dewitt</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>
