<p><date when="1831-11-21">Novr 21. 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>Joel </persName>intends to go and see you which gives an opportunity to
write<pb n="710"/></p>

<p>lf <persName>Mrs Holley</persName> wishes to come up I want the Dearborn to go into
<placeName>Bolivar </placeName>after her, and as the <placeName>road is bad through the bottom by
<persName>Harris</persName></placeName> I think you had better go in with it to <placeName>Bolivar </placeName>yourself and
you can then have the iron work done, which is much needed or
it well break worse&#8212; If <persName>Mrs Holley</persName> does not wish to come up she
will send word out to <persName>Mrs Bradleys </persName>for the Dearborn not to come
in after her&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Dr. Angier</persName> talks of going to <placeName>Anahuac </placeName>and perhaps you might
trade your Horses to his <persName>wife </persName>for her cattle&#8212;- <persName>John Austin </persName>says that
cattle are falling, and I also think they are, and that they can be
had cheaper by <date n="Spring - 1832">Spring</date>&#8212;I shall leave here in a few days for 
<placeName>Anahuac</placeName>, and from there I shall hire a boat and go direct to your place&#8212;
you must then furnish me with horses to go to <placeName>Bolivar </placeName>and 
<placeName>Brazoria</placeName>&#8212;  It probably will be <date when="1831-12-05">two weeks</date> before I get to your <placeName>place</placeName>.</p>

<p>In the <placeName>bend on the north or upper side of Pleasant Creek close
to the timber some distance up the creek from its mouth</placeName> is very
rich <placeName>Shumac prairie</placeName> and a field there would be protected from the
heavy winds from the sea which sometimes whip out the corn and
blow it down</p>

<p>I have spoken to <persName>Cap John Austin</persName> for a number of orange fig
and peach trees&#8212; you must be very particular to go into <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>
after them in <date n="02-xx-1832">February</date>, also pomegranite&#8212; when you move down
you can take peach trees as many as you want from here but get
from all sides so as [to] have a greater variety&#8212; attend to this
for a season lost in planting fruit trees is a great deal&#8212; from 
<placeName>Bolivar </placeName>you can get <hi rend="italic">plums </hi>at <placeName><persName>Henry</persName>s</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The place for the <placeName>garden </placeName>and <placeName>orchard </placeName>is on the <placeName>South side of
Pleasant Bayou</placeName> and it ought to be broken up the first</p>

<p>I am in better spirits than I have been for Six months&#8212;all things
are working around right</p>

<p>I want you to send for the Mares and horses I have at <placeName><persName>Cole</persName>s</placeName> as
soon as you can take care of them, tho When I see you we can
arrange about that   <persName>Emily </persName>has a -<hi rend="italic">fine </hi>fat <persName>boy </persName>and all well&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Sinse writing this <persName>Mrs Bradley</persName> has had an application to stay up
here some time longer,</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James F. Perry</persName></p>
<p>pr. <persName>Joel</persName></p>
