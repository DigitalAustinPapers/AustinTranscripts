<p><placeName>San Antonio</placeName> <date when="1826-08-22">August 22 de 1826 (Wednesday)</date> </p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>I arrived at this place last <hi rend="italic"><date when="1826-08-18">fryday </date></hi>but declined writing untill
the present moment as I had not collected matter sufficient for a
lengthy letter and the mail does not go out untill <date when="1826-08-24">thursday</date>. on
my arrival here I found a letter from you and last mail brought
another; your " triste " letter by last mail has almost given me the
<hi rend="italic">horrors</hi>, to see you so gloomy&#8212;I am happy to hear your health is
so much improved&#8212;and I hope a favourable <persName>Slave </persName>Law will have
a <hi rend="italic">salutary effect</hi> in removing the <hi rend="italic">hippo </hi>and other <hi rend="italic">affecting </hi>
complaints&#8212;such as the frets, lowering the eye brows etc etc&#8212;</p>

<p>now for the news&#8212;in the first place <persName>Bernardo Gutierris</persName> has been
removed from office and yr friend <persName>Genl Anastacio Bustamente</persName> 
appointed in his place&#8212; The <persName>Government </persName>is much displeased at the
conduct of <persName>Gutierris</persName> he has deceived them on every point relative
to the state of <persName>Indian </persName>affairs in this Department&#8212;the <persName>Government</persName>
has made sufficient appropriations to carry on the <persName>Indian </persName>War with
energy but it appears he applied the appropriations of Govt to his
own private use; and represented to the Govt that the Campaign
was proceeding with all possible vigor&#8212; <persName>Bustamante </persName>will make
this <placeName>head Quarters</placeName> untill the war is finished&#8212;no doubt exists that he
is on the way&#8212;his proclamación to the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of this 
Department has already arrived   you will receive one by this mail&#8212;</p>

<p>I perceive by your letter that the <persName>Slave </persName>question has caused 
considerable sensation in the <placeName>Colony </placeName>I have had much conversation
with <persName>Saucedo </persName>and others on this subject I see no reason why you
should apprehend the abolition of the <persName>Slaves </persName>belonging to the <persName>300
families</persName>; the thing is decided with regard to that point&#8212;<hi rend="italic">those
<persName>slaves </persName>are guaranteed to the <persName>settlers </persName>by the Law of Colonization and
they cam, not he deprived of them</hi>&#8212;this is the opinion that prevails
in this place&#8212; The <hi rend="italic"><persName>Ayuntamiento </persName></hi>of this place presented a 
memorial to the <persName>Legislature </persName>as soon as the project arrived&#8212;praying that
the discussion on that important point might be suspended untill
they could have time to <hi rend="italic">consider </hi>upon it, and inform the other
<persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>of the Department that they might do the same.
Since then they have given it the attention it merited&#8212;and by the
last mail <hi rend="italic">have sent</hi> up a <hi rend="italic">representation couched</hi> in the strongest<pb n="1431"/>
language they could express in <hi rend="italic">favor </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">admission <placeName></hi>in the New
<hi rend="italic">Colonies</hi></placeName>&#8212;they <hi rend="italic">declare </hi>it to be <hi rend="italic">indispensable </hi>to the prosperity of
this Department; in fact they have said all they can say&#8212;as to
the prospect of freeing the <persName>slaves </persName>of the <persName>300 families</persName> they declare
it to [be] an unjust abuse of the rights of the <persName>Colonists</persName>&#8212; As to the
plan of indemnifying the <persName>Settlers </persName>for their <persName>slaves </persName>it is absurd
where is the <placeName>State </placeName>to obtain <hi rend="italic">500,000</hi>&#8212;in. <hi rend="italic">cash </hi>to pay for the <persName>slaves</persName>
that are already introduced&#8212;for it is not expected they will be
deprived of them&#8212;and lay out of their capital 3 or 4 years&#8212;all
these things have been considered&#8212;and <hi rend="italic">for my part</hi> I have a more
flattering hope of a favourable <persName>slave </persName>law&#8212;at this time than I have
ever had before&#8212;your <hi rend="italic">representation </hi>has been sent on&#8212;they say
it is "algo duro"&#8212;but they make allowances&#8212;<persName>Saucedo </persName>showed
me a letter from the <persName>Baron </persName>and the <persName>Senator Cevallos</persName> on this subject
the <hi rend="italic"><persName>viejo </persName></hi>is very warm on the subject&#8212;you will receive a copy of
it by mail&#8212; The <persName>Old Baron</persName> has strove hard for us&#8212;I know not
what would have been our fate if he had not been a member of the
Legislature&#8212; Our situation would have been a deplorable one 
indeed&#8212;</p>

<p>If a favourable <persName>Slave </persName>Law is passed it will be attributed in a great
measure to the <hi rend="italic">unremitted </hi>exertions of the <persName>Baron </persName>and I wish the
<persName>Settlers </persName>to know it&#8212;as many of them are inimical to him&#8212;popular
opinion has changed very much in his <hi rend="italic">favor </hi>within the last year in
this place&#8212;I wrote him a lengthy letter last mail to act a " contra "
to the " Triste " one I supposed you had written At all events if it
comes to the worst and the <persName>slaves </persName>of the <persName>300 families</persName> are <hi rend="italic">freed </hi>we
have a right to appeal to <persName>Congress</persName>&#8212;where I am convinced all will
go right&#8212;</p>

<p>I have conversed with <persName>Saucedo </persName>and <persName>Flores </persName>relative to yr. contract
with <persName>Burnett </persName>and <persName>Fullerton</persName>&#8212;<persName>Saucedo </persName>is fully of the opinion that
you are at <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>to make any contract of that kind you may think
proper&#8212;and recommends the plan as the surest and most expeditious
to settle the <placeName>New Colony</placeName>&#8212;he and <persName>Flores </persName>also observes that no 
objection can be made as to reserving a certain extent of <placeName>country </placeName>for them
and having it <hi rend="italic">surveyed </hi>against they arrive&#8212;even if they should not
arrive under a year&#8212;as the Law allows six years for the settling of
the <placeName>new Colonies</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand the law relative to the introduction of
<persName>100 families</persName> before they can receive possession&#8212;<persName>Saucedo </persName>say's that as
fast as they arrive they can have the quantity of land designated to
them the law allows&#8212;and they can go on to it and go to work and
when the <persName>Commissioner </persName><hi rend="italic">arrives </hi>they can be put in possession&#8212;<persName>Flores</persName>
will wait untill he hears more from you&#8212;or untill the <persName>Slave </persName>
question is decided but he tells me to inform you that you may expect<pb n="1432"/>
the utmost <hi rend="italic">latitude </hi>from him that can be given&#8212;without infringing
the Law of Colonization too much&#8212;</p>

<p>I have fully explained to <persName>Saucedo </persName>the necessity of your <hi rend="italic">receiving</hi>
something to satisfy you for your trouble and the expense you
are at&#8212;</p>

<p>he feels fully convinced that it is just and right you should do
so&#8212;and says there will be no difficulty on that head&#8212;If you can make
a <hi rend="italic">contract </hi>with the <persName>new Settlers </persName>to pay 20, 30, or 100 dollars; if you
please over and above what the Govt requires&#8212;he says you have a
right to do so&#8212;as the Law makes all contracts on the part of the
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Empresario </persName></hi>and <persName>Colonists </persName>binding provided it is with their consent&#8212;
however&#8212;he has promised me to do all he can for you on this point&#8212;
The <persName>New Arancel Mr. Kerr</persName>&#8212;will take on&#8212;I have seen the 
instructions of <persName>Flores </persName>they are very <hi rend="italic">full </hi>and <hi rend="italic">explicit </hi>but they are so lengthy
that owing to my <hi rend="italic">bad health</hi> I shall not be able to copy them for
you&#8212;With the advice of <persName>Saucedo </persName>I do not think it necessary for me
to go on to <hi rend="italic">Saltillo </hi>but I have written the <persName>Baron </persName>that should it be
necessary&#8212;to write me Directed to <placeName>san Carlos</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I shall leave this the <date n="8-24-1826">day after to morrow </date>for <placeName>Laredo</placeName>&#8212;I wish you
to write to me directed to <placeName>San Carlos</placeName>&#8212;you must expect no assistance
from this place untill the <persName>Comdt Genl Bustamante</persName> arrives then I 
expect <persName>troops </persName>will be stationed on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Ahumada </persName>will be removed
to <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>&#8212;with the <persName>Troops </persName>under his command, and a 
<persName>garrison </persName>will be placed on the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>&#8212;the Govt has appropriated an 
immense sum for the payment of <persName>Troops </persName>stationed in this Department
$60,000 dollars arrived not long since and 30,000 will arrive next
week&#8212;and 30,000 more is <hi rend="italic">already </hi> "habilitado "&#8212;</p>

<p>Your draft on the Govt at this place has been duly <hi rend="italic">honored </hi>and I
can get the money today&#8212;</p>

<p>The <placeName>French </placeName>fleet has met with a <hi rend="italic">total defeat</hi> <placeName>10 miles the other
side of the San Marks</placeName>&#8212;6 <persName>Indians </persName>stole 80&#8212;mules and 25 horses and
left them completely on foot&#8212;they have procured 30 yoke of oxen
in this place&#8212;and have been a week gone to bring in the waggons&#8212;</p>

<p>The order for an Election for <persName>Electors </persName>was published in this
place on <date when="1826-08-20">Sunday last</date>&#8212;and the same will be forwarded on to the
<placeName>Brazos </placeName>by this mail&#8212;It appears the <persName>Electors </persName>are to meet at this
place on the <date when="1826-09-06">6th of next month</date> for the purpose of Electing an <persName>Elector</persName>
to vote for <persName>Deputies to Congress</persName> the <persName>Elector </persName>that is appointed has
to go all the way to <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>to give in his vote&#8212;and has to bear
his own expense there and back; the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of this place are
very much disgusted with so absurd a regulation&#8212;and I believe they
have come to the conclusion to vote for the <persName>Baron</persName>; as he is already
there and it is well known he will only vote for those that are 
favourably disposed towards this Department&#8212;they speak of <persName>Dn Victor
Blanco</persName>, <persName>Gonzales</persName>, <persName>Cevallos</persName>, or <persName>Yesca [Viesca]</persName>&#8212;we are entitled to 4<pb n="1433"/>
<persName>Electors </persName>and they must be instructed to vote for the <persName>Baron </persName>as
<persName>Elector</persName>&#8212;O! how the <persName>Citizens </persName>of this place do curse the day they
connected themselves to <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Coahuila</placeName></hi></p>

<p>I cannot tell when I shall return I am determined not to do so
untill I do something&#8212;If slavery is not permitted I have come to
the conclusion provided I can get 100 mules to employ 4 or 5000
dollars in goods and bring them to this place&#8212;I have never seen so
good a prospect to clean 8 or 9000 dollars as offers at this time&#8212;
here (and owing to the prohibition laws which they have lately 
received the strictest orders to enforce) And the additional <hi rend="italic">number</hi>
of <persName>troops </persName>to be stationed here, the prospect will be better&#8212;6 or 7
months hence&#8212;</p>

<p>As to the <placeName>Colony </placeName><persName>Saucedo </persName>says there is no restriction&#8212;there is
one thing I wish to caution you&#8212;There has lately arrived here a
new <hi rend="italic">decree </hi>relative to passports and you must be particular to whom
you give pasports hereafter&#8212;(the same order has been sent on to
you) you will have to express in the pasports whether they are
<persName>Colonists </persName>or not&#8212;if they bring goods the <hi rend="italic">kind </hi>and the amt The
cause of this last Decree relating to pasports is owing [to] <hi rend="italic">abuses</hi>
comitted by <persName>strangers </persName><placeName>on the Coast</placeName> against the <hi rend="italic">Revenue </hi>laws&#8212;and
also for fear <placeName>Spain </placeName>may introduce <persName>Emissaries </persName>into this <placeName>republic </placeName>as
she has lately done in <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName></hi>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Berrimende</persName> and <persName>Dn Erasmo's son Juan </persName>will start on the <date when="1826-09-01">1st of next
month</date> for <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> they calculate to go by <placeName>Sn Felipe</placeName> you must
try and be at home&#8212;I wish you to be <hi rend="italic">very particular</hi> in yr attentions
to <hi rend="italic"><persName>Juan </persName>for my sake</hi> for I am certainly <hi rend="italic">indebted </hi>to his <persName>family </persName>for
inumerable favors&#8212;<[should] he want a new supply of provisions
furnish him with the best let it cost what it may&#8212;Also he will want
letters of recomendation to <persName>persons </persName>in 
 which I wish
you to furnish him with he goes on to purchase goods, probably
to the amt of 1000 or 1,200&#8212;Also tell <persName>Mrs. Picket</persName> to have some good
<hi rend="italic">butter </hi>for him to take along on the road&#8212;I would rather that you
and <persName>J. E. G[ross]</persName>&#8212;would come to some understanding different
from the one you are now on&#8212;as to Keep from what I have learned
since I left you&#8212;it is his intention to leave the <placeName>country </placeName>shortly&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Parker </persName>has been imprisoned in <placeName>La Bahia</placeName> very unjustly I have
procured an order for his release&#8212;which the <persName>Govr </persName>has sent on to
day-</p>
<p>Do, let me beg of you to assume more cheerfulness you always
put the worst construction on things and thereby render yourself
fretful and melancholy&#8212;you are . . . [three lines torn away] there
has been and is still much sickness on this place</p>

<p>I wish you to inform <persName>Huber </persName>that he can do well in this place; as to
His procuring a situation in the army it is uncertain untill the arrival<pb n="1434"/>
of <persName>Bustamante </persName>for the <persName>Comte</persName>- of this place has petitioned for a
<persName>surgeon </persName>some time since&#8212;And the Govt- has promisd to <hi rend="italic">furnish</hi>
one&#8212;but in the mean time <persName>Huber </persName>could come on and learn the
language and form acquaintances&#8212;The obligation of <persName>Roxo the
Chief</persName> has [been] received and enclosed I send you his receipt&#8212;
<persName>Saucedo </persName>has informed me that from recent information reced- (not
officially) <persName>Edwards </persName>will not be <hi rend="italic">permitted </hi>to go on with his <placeName>Colony</placeName>
but will have to leave the <placeName>Country </placeName>beyond a doubt&#8212;</p>

<p>I think <persName>Burnett</persName>'s prospect pretty good&#8212;If <persName>Burnett </persName>gets the
settling of that <placeName>country </placeName>I think you ought to make some 
arrangement to have an interest in it.</p>

<p>Do not neglect to ascertain if <persName>Bingham </persName>will sell his <placeName>Gin </placeName>and for
what price&#8212;and let <persName>Musquis </persName>know by next mail if possible&#8212;I wrote
to him on the subject before I left home&#8212;Also I wrote to<persName> Capt.
Hirams</persName> to collect me a few pounds of Turpentine and to send it to
<persName>Williams</persName>&#8212;to be forwarded on to <persName>Dn Erasmo</persName> by the <persName>mail rider</persName>&#8212;it
is for <persName>Musquis </persName>and . . . [three lines torn away.]</p>

<p>Tell <persName>Williams </persName>that <persName>Dn. Erasmo</persName> has not time to write him this
mail owing to Multiplicty of business&#8212; he thinks he had better come
on here&#8212;</p>

<p>Enclosed I send you the measure of <persName>Saucedo </persName>for a pair of shoes
which do not fail to send him by the <persName>Mail rider</persName> if they can be 
procured.</p>

<p>My health is bad&#8212; I continue weak and you must excuse errors in
this lengthy scrawl&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Lewis </persName>is still in <placeName>Santa Rosa</placeName> his business is unfinished as yet but
has taken <hi rend="italic">favourable turn</hi>&#8212; I am told he is engaged in working
a mine&#8212;</p>

<p>(<date when="1826-08-24">Thursday</date>) Since writing the above Owing to my weakness and
the <persName>company </persName>that starts to day for <placeName>Laredo </placeName>not being sufficiently
strong I shall wait until the <date when="1826-09-01">1st. of next month</date>&#8212; When we can make
up a considerable <persName>party</persName>&#8212; I am <hi rend="italic">informed </hi>the <placeName>road </placeName>is infested by
<persName>Indians</persName>.</p>

<p>Give my respects to <persName>Williams </persName>and <persName>Burnett</persName>&#8212; I am glad to hear
that <persName>Williams </persName>" <hi rend="italic">devil</hi>" has started I hope he will have more peace
of mind than formerly&#8212;The mail has just arrived from the 
<placeName>interior</placeName>&#8212;The first part of the Constitution has arrived&#8212; (that is the
project) no part of it has yet been adopted The Discussion comd
