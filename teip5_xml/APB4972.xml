<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1835-10-21">21 October 1835</date></p>
<p>My Dear Sir&#8212;</p>

<p>I have lately written you two letters merely informing you of what has
been passing here, in regard to <placeName>Texas </placeName>since you left this <placeName>city</placeName>&#8212; The news
of your long (by me) expected war movement reached this <placeName>city </placeName>on the
<date when="1835-10-12">12th Inst</date> and I immy called a public meeting of our <persName>citizens </persName>at the <placeName>Bank
Arcade</placeName> for the Evening of the <date when="1835-10-13">13th</date> you may judge of the prepared 
[profound] excitement of the Public Mind, when I assure you the meeting was
the largest ever known in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>&#8212;and by acclamation we passed
the resolutions you will find inclosed&#8212; So great was the <persName>crowd </persName>that the
large Room would not hold them and we had to retire to another&#8212; we
<date when="1835-10-20">yesterday </date>sent off two <persName>divisions of about <persName>60 men</persName> each</persName>, one by way of the
<placeName>River </placeName>to <placeName>Nagatodges</placeName>-the other by the <placeName>Sc Columbus</placeName> to <placeName>Brassoria</placeName>, well<pb n="198"/>
armed and equipped with cannon, guns, powder, Balls, Lead&#8212;Saddles
Bridles etc. etc. and in a few days we will dispatch the Sc. Louisiana with
a <persName>third Division</persName>&#8212;those gone, are all fine looking <persName>young men</persName>&#8212;genteel in
appearance, and I have no doubt will do honor to themselves&#8212;many of
them have left respectable situations of $1200 to $1500 a year in 
<placeName>Counting houses</placeName> here&#8212;besides&#8212;The <persName>Creoles of the <placeName>Lower Fauburg</placeName></persName> not to be
outdone by us, have I am trully informed raised a <persName>corps of 150 men</persName> at
their expense&#8212;who will depart immy&#8212; Thus you see my Dear Sir&#8212;your
cause must and will succeed, because all feel you are in the Right&#8212; There
are men engaged in your cause here, who by their power, wealth and 
influence can do almost anything&#8212; The excitement is still at its height&#8212;
hundreds of applications are daily making to join the Rank&#8212; but we allow
only those <hi rend="italic">we </hi>choose to muster in them.&#8212;</p>

<p>This movement of ours here will be followed by similar ones thru' the
<placeName>whole valley of the Mississippi</placeName>&#8212;<placeName>Natches </placeName>is up already&#8212;from <placeName>N. York
</placeName><placeName>Bostn </placeName>and <placeName>Philada</placeName>- also means will come to us&#8212;and the only fears I 
entertain are&#8212;in the first place that more will be received than required&#8212;.
and that from the <placeName>upper Country</placeName> a population may be entered among you,
that will be of little use afterwards&#8212;however the Crisis is alarming and
for the sake of health we must take the Bitter with the Sweet&#8212;</p>

<p>It is with feelings of indescribable emotion, that all here, wait with 
intense anxiety for news from your <placeName>Quarter</placeName>&#8212; What have the division that
went after <persName>Coss </persName>done? Where is <persName>Col. Austin</persName>? Have they declared a
<persName>provisional Govt</persName> adhering to the Constitution of <date n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date>???&#8212; Upon this
last act&#8212; <hi rend="italic">"hangs all the Law and the Prophets"</hi> <persName>Coss </persName>must be checked&#8212;
The <placeName>state of Zacatecas</placeName> and <persName>more than one half the people of the <placeName>Mexican
Republic</placeName></persName>&#8212;only await one conquering cry to flash out, to rally with 
redoubled energy&#8212;then the Fate of the Tyrant is inevitable&#8212;and your 
country I hope, placed upon a different and more permanent basis of True
Liberty than it has ever yet enjoyed&#8212;then how Glorious for <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;what
a spectacle for the world to behold&#8212;</p>

<p>as for myself my dear sir&#8212;I have the same opinions now I expressed to
you here&#8212;a thousand times a day I am asked are you going?&#8212; When
do you go?&#8212; my answer is this I await further intelligence from <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;
I wait to hear of the formation of a <persName>Provl. Govt</persName>-&#8212;and if that body require
me&#8212;I am in a moment ready&#8212;mean time I can do some good to the great
cause here&#8212;but sir if that <persName>Govt</persName>. should appoint me, I will instantly obey
the call&#8212;</p>

<p>above all things, keep the <persName>Committee </persName>here (whose names are inclosed)
in constant information of all your movements, even by <persName>express </persName>if 
necessary&#8212;I will keep you constantly informd by every oppy- of what is going
on in this <placeName>Quarter</placeName>&#8212; do you the same by us relative to yours&#8212;in a moment.<pb n="199"/>
like this&#8212; I have but little time to write, the <persName>Divisions </persName>sail as soon as this
letter is closed&#8212;therefore no more&#8212;but&#8212;Victory and Liberty for Ever</p>

<p><persName>Jas Ramage </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Col. Stephen Austin</persName> <placeName>Texas</placeName></p>

<p>N. B. I had forgot to mention You will see in the inclosed paper
that <persName>Genl. Mehia</persName>, a man named <persName>Fisher </persName>and others were at the meeting&#8212;
we have our doubts&#8212; These expeditions are solely, purely, simply <persName>American </persName>in all their parts&#8212;</p>
