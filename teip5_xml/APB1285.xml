<p>To the <persName>Honble Judge Austin</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The petition of <persName>Nicholas Clopper</persName>, at <placeName>San felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1826-09-16">16
Septr 1826</date><pb n="1457"/></p>

<p>Humbly sheweth, that in a decision (filed in your <placeName>office</placeName>) had
before<persName> M. B. Nuckols Esq Alcalde of the <placeName>D. S. F. de Austin</placeName></persName> wherein
<persName>C. G. Alsbury</persName> was pit if and your <persName>petitioner </persName>deft your <persName>petitioner </persName>is
of opinion, that very great Injustice has been done him and 
therefore prays relief from your honor.</p>

<p>It will appear that the Judgt render'd in the Case aforsaid by
the <persName>Alcalde </persName>is for Seventy Three Dollars and fifty Cents, in Land
or Cattle. Now your Honor will perceive that by a true statement
of accote between <persName>Alsbury </persName>and your <persName>petitioner </persName>a considerable amot
see statement No 1 hereto annexed which he unjustly detains to
the great damage and loss of your <persName>petitioner</persName>, and when your 
<persName>petitioner </persName>agreed to let the said <persName>Alsbury </persName>have two Cows and Calves
from <persName>Capt Christman</persName>, it was for the express purpose of paying
for a Bay Mare which your <persName>petitioner </persName>had contracted for with
<persName>Mr. Hollyman</persName>, and the said <persName>Alsbury </persName>wrote a Letter to your 
<persName>petitioner </persName>stating that the reason he did not get the mare was that
she had a young Colt and supposed she would not suit whereas
your <persName>petitioner </persName>saw <persName>Mr Hollyman</persName> after receiving <persName>Alsbury</persName>s Letter
and <persName>Mr H</persName> said that it was not true the mare had not a Colt, nor
had<persName> Mr A</persName> said anything to him about the mare from which 
circumstances with others your <persName>petitioner </persName>is apprehensive that said
<persName>Alsbury </persName>is endeavouring to defraud him, for as late as the <date when="1826-09-07">7th day
of the present month</date>, the said <persName>Alsbury </persName>told your <persName>petitioner </persName>that he
had Cattle intended for your <persName>petitioner </persName>in the hands of <persName>Wm.
Robins,</persName> but your <persName>petitioner </persName>now doubting the truth of this 
assertion made it his business to see <persName>Mr Robins</persName> who said that there was
no contract between him and <persName>Alsbury </persName>nor any prospect of one,
and that he had no Cattle to deliver to said <persName>Alsbury</persName>, or his order,
this circumstance again excited strong suspicions in the mind of
your <persName>petitioner</persName>, that the said <persName>Alsbury </persName>intended a fraud&#8212;Your
<persName>petitioner </persName>wishes not to withhold any thing that is due from him
to another, and prays that you will set aside the Judgt&#8212;aforesaid,
which he doubts not you will at once see to be Erroneous; and will
direct such proceedings as that Justice may be done to both <persName>parties</persName>
&#8212;and that your <persName>petitioner </persName>may be secured in his just Rights.</p>

<p>And in duty bound, will ever pray</p>

<p>(Signed)           <persName>N. Clopper</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>I do hereby Certify that <persName>C. G. Alsbury</persName> Received from me an ordr to
<persName>Esqr Harris</persName> for four Cows and Calves two of which was on accot
of <persName>N. Clopper</persName> and two, on acct of <persName>J. C. Ludlow</persName> in Testimony whereof
I have herewith set my hand <date n="09-xx-1826">Septr 1826</date></p>
