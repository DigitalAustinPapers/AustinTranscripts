<p>[1812?]</p>
<p>Memorandum</p>

<p>It is to be observed that this Exhebit cannot be closed entirely in
consequence of the agency of <persName>Judethu Kendle</persName> Not having been 
settled and altho. the books of said <persName>Kendle </persName>have been obtained the
unsettled state of the accounts rendered it impossible to make a
close of them in time for this Exhebit it is also proper to Notice
that as many account of the <persName>company </persName>stand unsettled and may when
closed create a Debt or Cr to the <placeName>Lead Mine</placeName> A/c it would be improper
to close this Exhebit entirely untill such settlements are compleated&#8212;
It appears that the amount of Mineral Smelted by the <persName>companey </persName>from
<date n="xx-xx-1798">1798 </date>to <date n="xx-xx-1812">1812 </date>has been 2680 186 pound which has produced 1750 975
Lead about 65 1/2 pr on the Mineral Smelted&#8212;This Deft [defendant]
reserved to himself the right of correcting any Errors or omissions<pb n="222"/>
that may have taken place in this exhebit should any hereafter be
found to exist&#8212;</p>
<p><placeName>Boat Building</placeName></p>
<p>6 Boats 40 feet each is 240 [feet] @ 3 Dollars [per foot] 720 of
these boats 4 was lost in a storm in the <placeName>Mississippi </placeName>and two loaded
with about 14 thousand Pine staves and sent to <placeName>Orleans </placeName>which Debt
I beleave was sold for 20 Dollars pr thousand but as the Voyage
under the care of <persName>Elias A Elliot</persName> has not been settled it cannot now
be stated what will be the actual loss on this stave business, all the
money advanced by this Deft for the purchase of staves are 
included in the above account the true state of this business cannot
be Known untill <persName>Moses </persName>and <persName>James Austin</persName> settles there A/c with the
companey also.</p>
