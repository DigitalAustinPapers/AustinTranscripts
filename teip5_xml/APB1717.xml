<p>[From Bexar Archives]</p>

<p>Dear Sir I feel it my duty to inform you that there is and has
lately been a very considerable quantity of contraband passed on in
the Direction of <placeName>Bejar </placeName>and I beleave both <persName>Mexicans </persName>and <persName>Americans</persName>
are ingaged in that traffic&#8212; There are two <placeName>roads </placeName>formed within a
few months which cross the <placeName>Guadaluop </placeName><placeName>below this place one about a
league, and the other about three leagues below this Town</placeName>&#8212; I have
no <persName>troops </persName>at my command&#8212;and therefore it is out of my power to
detect it without it should come through this <placeName>town </placeName>which they
always avoid&#8212; This contraband is not owned by <persName>people </persName>under my
Jurisdiction; neither do they wish it to pass through this 
<placeName>neighborhood</placeName>, least they should be blamed for incouraging it; And you well
remember the censure which has been thrown on me at the <placeName>Labaca</placeName>
on account of contraband of which I never took any part&#8212; And
now again passing so near me compells me to give you this 
information; and hope there may be mean[s] taken to prevent its coming
through our <placeName>vicinity</placeName></p>

<p>The threats of the <persName>Indians </persName>I fear will greatly retard the settling
of the <placeName>country</placeName>; but should a Campaign be sent against them in a
properly manner I think there can be an end put to them at once.</p>

<p>Could a few <persName>troops </persName>be furnished us at this time, it would greatly
add to the settling of the <placeName>colony</placeName>, and there by strengthen the <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>I would be truly happy to recieve a line from you respecting the
<persName>Indians </persName>and the probability of our geting some <persName>troops </persName>at this place
etc.</p>
