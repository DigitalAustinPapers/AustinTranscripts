<p>Dear <persName>Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of informing you that my long and unremitted
exertions have been finally crowned with success having received a
<placeName>Grant </placeName>bounded as asked for when you was in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>with the 
exception of the part lying <placeName>below the San Antonio road</placeName><placeName> in the fork of the
Rivers Brassos</placeName> and <placeName>Navisote </placeName>being informed by <persName>Baron de Bastrop
</persName>that this part has already been disposed of I changed my application
making the road the line.
</p>
<p>Several others have obtained <placeName>grants </placeName>of which <persName>Capt DeWitt</persName> will
inform you this being the case it becomes necessary that all the
<persName>Empresarios </persName>should make such disposition of their <placeName>lands </placeName>that will
not effect the interest of an other and that will be satisfactory to the
<persName>emigrants </persName>and that will promote the immediate settlement of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
to affect this it will require that some uniform mode be established
to Govern the whole which I have no doubt that each of the 
<persName>Empresarios </persName>are disposed to agree to.</p>

<p>I presume that you still adhere to your first price established viz
12 1/2 cts per acre the exps of surveying and making the title which I
am of Opinion is low enough when we take into consideration the
trouble and hardships we have to undergo in settling a <placeName>wilderness</placeName>.</p>
<p>On the subject I wish you to write me by<persName> Capt De Witt</persName> who can
put the letter in the first <placeName>post Office</placeName> that he reaches in the <placeName>United
States</placeName> unless a vessel should sail from your place to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>
in a short time.</p>

<p>I will suggest to you that it is very important to the interest of
<placeName>Texas </placeName>that <persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName> should be reelected as from what I
have seen of him I presume that you can send no person that will
use the same exertions for that section of <placeName>Country </placeName>or that is as well
qualified for your representation. And I can assure you that he is
devoted to your interest</p>

<p>I refer you to <persName>Capt De Witt</persName> for a detail of the news in this part
of the <placeName>Country</placeName></p>

<p>Wishing you health and prosperity.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p><persName>[Robert Leftwich?]</persName></p>
<p>[or <persName>Haden Edwards?]</persName></p>
