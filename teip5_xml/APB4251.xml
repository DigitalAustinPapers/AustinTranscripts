<p><placeName>Gin Place </placeName><date when="1831-08-04">4th August 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>Col. S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dr Sir. I received your favour of the <date when="1831-08-01">1st Inst</date> by <persName>Mr Hunter</persName>,
I am truely sorry I could not obtain the <placeName>Clear Creek tract</placeName>.  I am a<pb n="686"/>
<persName>stranger </persName>in the <placeName>country </placeName>and my health has been and still remains
so bad I have had no oppertunity of travling to make a Selection-
even one or two rides to <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>has weakened me in such a manner
I have been compeld to take two days to it. <persName>Mr Hunter</persName> informs me
that <hi rend="italic"><persName>Major Douglass</persName></hi> has made an Entry of my <persName>Negroes </persName>in your office
as his <persName>property</persName>&#8212; Now fair, I wish to prove to you that I am, and
know, I shall always remain above <hi rend="italic">falsehood</hi>, I told you the 
<persName>property </persName>was mine Enclosed you will receive Vouchers sufficient to 
satisfy you and every other <persName>person </persName>that he does not, nor ever did own
any part of the <persName>property </persName>in my possession nor does he own one Dollars 
worth in the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;his statement is gratuitous and false and
unauthorized by me&#8212;</p>

<p>When the <persName>Major </persName>went to <placeName>San Phillipe</placeName> <date n="03-xx-1831">last March</date>, I asked him to
take an <persName>Indenture </persName>that he was a <persName>witness </persName>to and prove it before the
<persName>proper authority</persName> in <placeName>San Phillipe</placeName>, when he returnd I asked him why
he had not done so&#8212; he then told me that himself and <persName>Mr S.
Williams</persName> had a misunderstanding&#8212;but he did not tell me he had
presumed to enter the property as his, and I do hope his imprudent
conduct will not be suffered to weigh one jot against me&#8212;</p>

<p>I also inclose you a letter from <persName>Capt- John Austin</persName>, and I think
I may venture to say (without egotism) that they are few men that
have settled in this <placeName>Colony </placeName>that have behaved better, and have made
more <persName>friends </persName>in so short a time.</p>

<p>I have been anxious, and nothing but delicate health has 
presented me from coming to<placeName> San Phillipe</placeName> long since, to comply with
the terms of the Law, <persName>Mr Hall</persName> can inform you I have been very
sick&#8212;but I say again, as soon as my health permits I will come up
and do every thing that is necessary to make a <persName>Citizen</persName>-&#8212; Under
those considerations I do hope sir you will reconsider my <hi rend="italic">Case </hi>and
if it is a possible thing give me the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Clear Creek tract of land</placeName></hi>&#8212; I
assure your sir I remain your very obednt and humble Servant</p>

<p><persName>Sylvester Murphy</persName></p>

<p>NB you will observe the <persName>Major </persName>acted as <persName>agent </persName>for me in clearing
the <persName>Negroes</persName>, my health was so bad I could not attend to it, and
on the back of the Manifest he acknowledges that fact&#8212;   <persName>S M</persName></p>
