<p><persName>Stephen F Austin Esqr</persName></p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I have so repeatedly written you and have never received aline
from you, that I have frequently almost determined to decline the<pb n="1399"/>
matter I am still using great industry in geting up <persName>Company </persName>to
visit your <placeName>grant </placeName>and have left nothing undone on my part since the
death of my <placeName>Brother </placeName>I have been a perfect <persName>slave </persName>and have great 
difficulty in Keeping the two <persName>families </persName>from actual want they ware left
without One Dollar I have gotten <persName>George the Eldest son of my
Brother</persName> in the <persName>Navy </persName>and he is ordered into the service I inclosed to
you my two <placeName>Grants </placeName>of land By <persName>J E B Austin</persName> do the best you can
with them for me hand the letters inclosed and say what is 
necessary, from the intimacy and friendship between the <persName>families </persName>I had
hoped to been by you advised etc as to the interest we had taken in
the <placeName>Grant </placeName>you are labouring under fals impressions as to <persName>Botts </persName>and
my self On <date n="08/28/1826">Next monday</date> there is to be a large meeting of <persName>Citizens</persName>
at <placeName>Versailles Woodford County</placeName> on the subject of going to your 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>I find it stands higher than any other grant the colonel
is about starting please [write] me and <persName>Mrs. J. H. Hawkin</persName>s when
you find it Convenient so soon as I can place the <persName>families </persName>in that 
situation that will Keep them from actual want It is my intention to
come to the <placeName>Country </placeName>Change if necessary my two <placeName>grants </placeName>and have
them located where you think best particularly the One on 
<placeName>Guadeloupe </placeName>if best so to do the reports as to the inundation of the lands on
<placeName>Brassos </placeName>and <placeName>Colorado Rivers</placeName> is unfavourable and I am disprising (?)
those impressions believing they are not true</p>

<p>god bless you and your friends</p>

<p><persName>L Hawkins</persName></p>

<p>Please speak of me to your <persName>Brother   </persName>I would give all I possess to
have two hours conversation with you</p>
