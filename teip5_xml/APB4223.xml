<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I feel to Congratulate you on Your return, and have much to
say and inquire when your business which (now necessarily presses
on your first arrival) shall give you leisure. But Relative to my
Surveys and returns It must be remembered that <placeName>Coast Surveys</placeName>
require four times the work in Surveying as well as plotting to
what just<placeName> square Leagues</placeName> do, and great time is Spent in hunting
land, to suit people such was the fact on, and about, <placeName>Spring Creek</placeName>,
<persName>Mr Hubert</persName> Said he believed he could explore and find land that
would be taken and If I would let him Survey it he would take
the trouble to explore, While I was there; had I known; where,
was any <placeName>land </placeName>I could soon survey, ec. but no one knew of any;
but it seems he has found some and surveyed&#8212;which would 
otherwise been unknown, I have myself been exploring a good deal
over this section and I run back and forwards to<placeName> Spring Creek </placeName>for
notes which I am now blamed for I could do little else and my
services would be lost to the <placeName>office</placeName>.</p>

<p>You know I am industrious: But I shall obey every order, and be
there, for whatever I may be wanted; and I am expense to myself
of paying for the surveying of the land I did not know was found.
Some mistakes, I am sorry for; that any should occur, But believe
me ever the same</p>

<p><persName>E. R. Wightman </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Col. S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>Hubert </persName>is not much of a <persName>Surveyor </persName>I did think as he had been
out with me and carried the Compass some that he could run Cor-<pb n="666"/>
rectly all he would find<placeName> on and adjacent to Spring Creek </placeName>and if
his minutes had not been sent to all the <persName>Surveyors </persName>to be Condensced
I Could understood them but this was his fault he should have
sent them enclosed to me, for it is not to be expected that other
<persName>Surveyors </persName>would take the trouble if they could understand them
neither <persName>Jones </persName>nor <persName>Cook</persName>'s minutes could be understood by those 
unaquainted with their notes</p>
