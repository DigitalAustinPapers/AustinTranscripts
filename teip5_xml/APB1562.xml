<p>[About July 1, 1828.]</p>
<p>My Dear <persName>Stephen </persName>,</p>
<p>We received your letter of <date when="1828-03-31">March 31st</date>, which was most welcome,
for it was better than <date n="03-xx-1827">twelve months</date> since we had recived a line
from eather your or <persName>Brown</persName>, I had began to think that the 
unfavourable reports that we heard was true or that you had got so
much taken up Colonizing that your <persName>Sister </persName>was forgotten; you
accuse me of neglect, and forgitfullness you sencure me wrongfully
my Dear <persName>Brother</persName>, your are never absent from my thoughts; often
O! how often do I think of you, and lament that we cannot meet
once in a while, if you could only look in on me, and see what a
<persName>family </persName>I am surrounded with, you would not be surprised that every
moment of my time was Imploy'd. I shoud of writen you oftener
but <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> being obliged to write on business, thought that it
would be just the same as if I had written myself, I wil indeavor to<pb n="67"/>
write to you of tener in filter; but you do not receive all the 
letters, that are sent to you I wrote you a very long letter by <persName>Mr. John
McCormick,</persName> and also wrote to you by<persName> James Cole</persName> <date n="WInter - 1827">last winter</date>
neather of those letters I dont expect you have ever received, as I
have heard that the men never went to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, so you see My Dear
<persName>Brother </persName>that you are still remembered by your <persName>Sister </persName>and all your
old <persName>Friends</persName>; <persName>Judge Carr</persName> is now hear, he always inquires very 
particularly after you, he is still a <persName>Widdower</persName>, his Daugh [ter] <persName>Maria</persName>, I
am told has grown up a very pretty and Amiable Girl, she keeps
house for her <persName>father</persName>, and you know how particular he is, <persName>Verginia </persName>and
<persName>Cordelia </persName>are also with him he has but three <persName>Children</persName>, and Welthy&#8212;
<persName>Adeline Lewis</persName> is also a Widdowe with one <persName>Child </persName>a Girl, she keeps
house for her <persName>Father</persName>, in <placeName>Herculaneum</placeName>&#8212; <persName>Elias </persName>looks old he is 
inclined to be disapated, him and <persName>Honey </persName>are still ingaged in 
manufacturing Shot but do not do the business that they formily did.
<placeName>H[erculaneum]</placeName> I am told looks as if it was poverty struck, 
business is very dull every where, led is low, the <placeName>Fever River mines</placeName> have
drawn great numbers of the <persName>miners </persName>from this part of the <placeName>country</placeName>,
the <persName>Cir. Court</persName> sits hear this week the Suit of <persName>Price agaisnt the Perrys</persName>
comes on. the <persName>Supreme Court</persName> gave it against <persName>price</persName>, but that did not
sattisfye him, and he has now sued <persName>Ruggles </persName><persName>Samuel </persName><persName>John </persName>and
<persName>James Perry</persName>, God knows how it wil terminate this time <persName>Price </persName>since
he has been in possession of the <placeName>Mine A Burton Propperty</placeName> has
nearly extricated himself from debt; their has been an immencé
quantity of mineral raised off of that land, and still continue to
make discoverys, it is the opinion of all your old <persName>Friends </persName>that if you
would come on, their might be something done in the business. I
cannot se for my part why you cant visit <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, what are you
spending toiling and labouring your life a way for in that Wild
<placeName>Country </placeName>you have no <persName>Family </persName>to provide for, is it possible that you
cannot relize a nought [enough] (after incountering all you have
for several year back) to ennable you to Visit and Spend a few
months, with those old <persName>Friends </persName>and <persName>acquaintances </persName>that never will
for git you, you ought to recollect that our <persName>Family </persName>are a very short
lived race, a few years more and we shall be mouldering in the dust
with our <persName>fore Fathers</persName>&#8212; why then my Dear <persName>Stephen </persName>will you bury
yourself in that <placeName>remote region</placeName>, your life is pretty well spent few
years more you will be 40&#8212;you are now alone not incumbered with
a <persName>family</persName>&#8212; You have now open'd the road for <persName>Brown </persName>and since he
has made Choice of a <persName>companion </persName>to share with him the cares and
vexation of the troublsome world, it is necessary that he should
make evry exertion to make himself comfortable and independent;
but you my dear <persName>Stephen </persName>have no one but your self, and is it 
possible that after an absence of so many year that you cannot visit
your <persName>Sister</persName>, who you very well know cannot go to see you I have<pb n="68"/>
thought a great deal on this subject and have almost concled within
myself that you have lost all desire to see me or my <persName>children </persName>again
I am very well convincd that <persName>Brown </persName>and his <persName>Lady </persName>will visit me, if
kind Providence will only Smile on them I am in hopes that we shall
be able to git some thing from <persName>Fox </persName><persName>Mr. Learning</persName> says that the
<placeName>estate </placeName>is worth 6 or 7 thousand Dollars, and that he thinks <persName>Fox </persName>will
compromise&#8212;which will be much better than going to Law, I wish
My Dear S. that you would try and settle and arrange your 
busines so that you could spend the <date n="Fall - 1828">nex Fall</date> and <date n="Winter - 1828">Winter </date>in <placeName>Missouri</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>[E. M. Perry.]</p>
