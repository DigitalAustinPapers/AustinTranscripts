<p><persName>Mr. Austin</persName></p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>From a <placeName>New-Orleans Paper</placeName> I have perused with much 
satisfaction an extract of a Letter from you to a Gentleman in that City
and am highly gratified to find that you intend to carry into 
execution the noble enterprise contemplated by your honoured <persName>Father</persName>.</p>

<p>I would like very much to settle on your <placeName>Grant </placeName>for which reason
I will state to you the following particulars I have been used to
the Seafaring business for which reason I would prefer settling as
near <placeName>Mata Gorda</placeName> as I could get Farming Land after the <placeName>Port </placeName>
became settled I could act either as a <persName>pilot</persName>, <persName>Master of a Coaster</persName> (as I
would not wish to leave my [family long] at a time) <persName>Surveyor </persName>or
<persName>Farmer </persName>(the last [preferably] on the whole)    I understand Survey-<pb n="424"/>
ing by Calculation A number of people to whom I have talked are
anxious to move to that <placeName>Province </placeName>but are ignorant in what manner
to proceed to get Land you will therefore be (if you please) as
particular on this subject as your leisure will permit and if you have
got the number of <persName>Families </persName>contemplated you will inform me what
would be the best steps to take to get land from the <persName>Spanish 
Government</persName> and whether it could be got to join your Grant or not I would
likewise wish to know the quantity of Land that your <placeName>Grant </placeName>[con-
tains].</p>

<p>I would be glad to know at what time you will be at <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>
There some of my <persName>Neighbors </persName>and me will meet you and if you will
grant us land we will proceed on and make corn. My <persName>Family </persName>is small
consisting of a <persName>wife </persName>and two <persName>children</persName>.</p>

<p>My <persName>neighbors </persName>who contemplate moving hold <persName>slaves </persName>though their
<persName>white Families</persName> are small except one <persName>Family</persName>.</p>

<p>I am doing Public business at present and have an opportunity of
making your communication Public and if you wish for more 
settlers you will get a great many from this Country provided they like
your conditions</p>

<p><persName>Wm N. Henderson</persName></p>

<p>P. S. I wish to take two young [men] out with me both <persName>Farmers</persName>
You will Please to inform me whether you will grant them land or
not.    Direct to <persName>Wm. N. Henderson</persName><placeName> Opeolusas Louisiana</placeName>.</p>

<p>On receipt of this I would be glad if you would answer me 
Immediately as we wish to arrange our business in such a manner as to raise
corn <date n="Summer-1822">next summer</date> build a small sloop or Schooner and, move our
furniture farming utensils, tools etc in the <date n="Fall-1822">fall </date>in this mode we
could move all that we have at a small expense as we only live 20
Miles from the <placeName>Quelquese [Calcasieu]</placeName> an excellent navigable river
and we have <persName>slaves </persName>who are good <persName>sawyers </persName><persName>carpenters </persName>etc</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Stephen F. Austin Esq.</persName>    <placeName>Herculaneum   Missouri</placeName></p>
