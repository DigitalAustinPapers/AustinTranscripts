<p>My communication of the <date when="1826-04-30">30th of last April</date>, informed you of my
preparations for an attack upon the <persName>Waco</persName>, <persName>Tahuacano </persName>and <persName>Tahuiase</persName>
<placeName>villages</placeName>. All my arrangements were made for the <date when="1826-05-25">25th of this
month</date>; the concentration of the <persName>militia </persName>was to take place at <placeName><persName>James
Cortes</persName>' house</placeName>, at the <placeName>crossing of the San Antonio road</placeName> on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>,
on the <date when="1826-05-17">17th Instant</date>. The <persName>Cherokee Indians </persName>had been directed to 
attack the <placeName><persName>Tahuacano </persName>village</placeName> <placeName>on the head waters of the Navasota, about ten leagues East of the other villages</placeName>; the best spirit prevailed
among the <persName>militia</persName>. The above arrangements were made pursuant to
your communication of the <date when="1826-04-10">10th of April</date>, when, <date when="1826-05-08">today</date>, at 12 o'clock,
I received your reserved [reservado'] communication of the <date when="1826-05-04">4th 
Instant</date>, in which you order me to suspend any hostile movements
against the <persName>Indians </persName>for the present; and to send you, by the return
<pb n="1324"/>
of the <persName>Express </persName>a statement of the force at my disposal for an 
<persName>expedition </persName>; and, also, to appoint a place where I could meet you, your 
intentions being to take the field with 250 <persName>men </persName>in the month of <date n="07-xx-1826">July</date>.</p>

<p>In consequence of this order, I sent, at 3 o'clock P. M. an express
to the <persName>Cherokees </persName>to suspend their operations, alleging a hope of a
treaty of peace between the <persName>Indians </persName>and the <persName>Colonists</persName>, in order to
conceal the true motive; stating to them at the same time, that they
must remain in readiness to march at the earliest notice, in case the
peace could not be affected. I had already written my orders to the
<persName>Captains of Militia</persName>, informing them that the contemplated 
expedition was suspended in consequence of some hope of peace, which I
did, to give a reason for the counterorder without exposing the
true motive; but previous to these orders leaving my office, I 
received, at 6. o'clock P. M. by <persName>express </persName>a note from <persName>Captain Sims</persName> of
the <persName>Company of Militia of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName></persName>, <placeName>District of Bravo</placeName>, near the
<placeName>road to Bexar</placeName>, informing me that while he was executing my orders
to explore a <placeName>covered road</placeName> to the <placeName>Indian Villages</placeName>, along the <placeName>bottom
of the river</placeName>, to avoid being noticed on a march through <placeName>prairie
lands</placeName>, he discovered, at about <placeName>twenty five leagues above the road to
Bexar</placeName>, trails of mounted <persName>Indians</persName>, and a party on foot, leading to the
<placeName>settlement</placeName>. He returned at once to give information. I doubt not
but a <persName>party </persName>left their <placeName>villages </placeName>to attack us, and our <placeName>settlements </placeName>are
so scattered that it is difficult to determine upon what point they will
fall first. I have already transmitted orders in every direction to
send out <persName>spies</persName>. In consequence of this notice I have thought it
highly important not to communicate your order to suspend any
hostile movements against the <persName>Indians</persName>, because the <persName>Militia </persName>are now
ready to march to the <placeName>villages</placeName>, and I think, that if we are so 
fortunate as to discover the party that came to attack us, it would be
advisable, after having routed them, to proceed by forced marches
to their <placeName>villages</placeName>, and to fall on them before they had recovered from
the terror inseparable from defeat. I hope these circumstances
will be considered a sufficient excuse for my not suspending hostile
movements as you order me to do.</p>

<p>If the occurrences above alluded to do not compel me to march to
the <placeName>Indian Villages</placeName>, I shall defer the <persName>expedition </persName>agreeably to your
orders, in which event, I think we ought to meet at the <placeName>crossing of
the road to Bexar</placeName>, on the <date when="1826-06-27">27th of June</date>, so as to attack the <placeName>villages </placeName>by
the <date when="1826-07-04">4th of July</date>. Thus time would be afforded me to call on the
<persName>Militia of <placeName>Trinity </placeName>and <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>,</persName> the <persName>Cherokee </persName>and other <persName>tribes</persName>
in that section of the <placeName>country</placeName>. In the meantime I shall take every
step, my situation permits, to ascertain the movements of the 
<persName>Indians</persName>, etc. The number of <persName>men </persName>in this <placeName>Colony </placeName>on whom I can 
depend is from 175 to 200; 100 <persName>men</persName>, I believe may be expected from<pb n="1325"/>
the <placeName>Trinity </placeName>and <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>; and, perhaps, 100 <persName>Cherokees</persName>, <persName>Shawnees</persName>
and other trusty tribes of that section of the <placeName>Country</placeName>; provided you
think proper to give orders to these <persName>tribes </persName>and the <persName>militia </persName>to join us
in the contemplated expedition</p>

<p>The above is in answer to your reserved communication.</p>

<p>God and Liberty.</p>
