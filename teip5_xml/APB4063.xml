<p><placeName>New York</placeName><date when="1830-10-27"> Oct&#8212;27th 1830</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I have been here <date when="1830-10-22">five days</date> waiting on my Goods shiped from <placeName>Phila</placeName>
here to ship per Schooner Nelson they have at length arrived and
I hope to be ready to start&#8212;homeward <date when="1830-10-27">this afternoon</date>. The Nelson
is now owned by <persName>Messrs Wade and Sayer </persName>of this place and 
commanded by <persName>Capt. Fuller</persName> apparently a very clever man. The Nelson
will sail on <date when="1830-10-29">Friday </date>or <date when="1830-10-30">Saturday </date>and is intended to run regularly
between <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> and the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>. There is a number of 
<persName>passengers </persName>going in her among them is <persName>Mr. Wm T. Austin</persName> his <persName>Lady</persName>
and <persName>child </persName>(he is a <persName>brother of John Austin</persName> of <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>) <persName>Col. 
Woodburry</persName> and two of his <persName>Sons </persName>is also expected. I have seen <persName>Archibald
</persName>and <persName>John Austin,</persName> <persName>brothers of Captn Henry Austin</persName> since I arrived
here they both are very much interested in your sucksess and are
very clever men they have treated me with a great deal of kindness
since I have been here. I have purchased between 4 &amp; 5 thousand
"Dollars worth of Goods in <placeName>Phila </placeName>and will have about 3thd to send
from home which with some groceries from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> will make<pb n="523"/>
a very good assortment enough I think to make a tryal on. <persName>Mr.
Hunter</persName> will be in readiness to start as soon as I return from 
<placeName>Missouri </placeName>I will consigne our goods to <persName>McKinstrey </persName>and <persName>Austin </persName>at
<persName>Brazoria</persName>, part of the articles you wrote for is packed among the
goods viz Holsters Bridle Martingale Spurs and Boots and Vattel's
Laws of Nations in <persName>English</persName>. I could not get it in <persName>Spanish </persName>neither
in <placeName>Phila </placeName>nor in this place, the other <persName>Spanish </persName>Book you wrote for
is not to be found I have made every inquiry I could both in
<placeName>Phila </placeName>and here. Your other cloths was not finished when I left
<placeName>Phila </placeName>the undress suit was partly finished but, the uniform could
not be made for want of information how to make it Since I
arrived here <persName>Mr. James Treat the Mexican Consul </persName>gave me a
letter of introduction to <persName>Col [Mexia's] Ladey</persName> She shewed me her
<persName>husband</persName>s uniform and with the assistance of the <persName>Messrs Austin</persName>, I
have got a <persName>Taylor </persName>here to take a particular description of it and
when I return to <placeName>Phila </placeName>I will have it made and forwarded together
with the other coat vest Pantaloons Sword Sash appailetts and
belt by the way of <placeName>New Orleans.</placeName></p>

<p>I bought a poartable writing desk here for you had your name
engraved on it and put in the charge of <persName>Mr. Wm Austin</persName> for you I
have not procured the Book Case and Secretary for you my funds
run out but will buy and bring you one from<placeName> New Orleans</placeName>&#8212; I saw
<persName>Mr Learning</persName> in <placeName>Phila</placeName>. he has sent you some <placeName>maps </placeName>they will be put
in the care of <persName>Mr W. Austin</persName> for you the law suit with <persName>Fox </persName>does not
come to issue untill <date n="12-xx-1830">december </date>and <persName>Mr. Learning</persName> says it is very 
probable that it may be 12 or 18 months before there is anything recovered
from that <placeName>quarter </placeName>he was absent from the <placeName>city </placeName>most of the time I
was there and had not the Geonogical account which you requested
him to send you ready but he promised he wuld prepare it soon and
send it to you<persName> Messrs Gill, Ferguson &amp; Co</persName> has promised me to
forward to you the <placeName>Gazette </placeName>and the <placeName>Quarterly Review </placeName>I have not
got the paper that the advertisements you mentioned was in I expect
to get the one that yours was in but the one <persName>Smith</persName>s was in I am
afraid I will not find but I will try and if I can find them will send
them by <persName>Mr Hunter</persName>. I have recd letters from <placeName>home</placeName>. They were all
well. I am afraid <persName>Woodbury </persName>will have trouble about his <placeName>colony</placeName>,
as I am told that <persName>Prentice </persName>(the same that broke the <persName>Kentucky 
Insurance Company</persName>) and <persName>Col Mexar [Mexia]</persName> has claims to it. What the
nature of these claims is I know not&#8212; <persName>Col Mexhas Lady</persName> told me
her <persName>husband </persName>was going to <placeName>Texas </placeName><date n="Spring-1831">next Spring</date> to Settle that <placeName>colony</placeName>
and they say <persName>Woodbury </persName>has no claim to it, that he is merely an <persName>agent</persName>
for the others. It will be impossible for me to move my <persName>family</persName>
before <date n="03-xx-1831">March </date>and if you are elected to the Legislature it is possible<pb n="524"/>
that you will be home against the time we get there   adieu   may
God bless and preserve you</p>

<p><persName>James F. Perry</persName></p>

<p>I will send you the <placeName>Quarterly Review</placeName> by <persName>Mr. Hunter</persName> I expect
he will be there nearly as soon as the Nelson as he will be in readiness
as soon as I get <placeName>home</placeName>.</p>

<p>I have failed in procuring the necessary description of the uniform
Coat the <persName>Taylor </persName>could not describe it so that it could be made by
the description, as I have procured the cloth in <placeName>Phila</placeName>. I will send
it on my return to our mutial friends <persName>Austin </persName>and <persName>Taylor </persName>who have
prepared to attend to having it made here and forward to <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> by the first opportunity and will probably be there against
<persName>Mr. W. M. Hunter</persName> arrives at <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></p>
