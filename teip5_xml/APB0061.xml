<p><persName>Mr Moses Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir I herewith inclose you Account of Sales of your five
Hogsheads of Sugar recd per the Schooner Nancy from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>.<pb n="77"/>
I am very sorry that the Sales will be so little to your Satisfaction,
but it was the highest price that I could possibly procure&#8212; the
<persName>Sugar B[r]okers</persName> would give but 8 1/2 dollars p Cwt and pay the
amot in Loaff Sugar Those Sugars of yours were of the very worst
Quality which was agravated by a comparison with a parcele by
the same Vessell of an excellent quality which were landed at the
same time. <persName>James and Wm Miller </persName>had a number of Hhds consigned
them by same Vessell of as bad a kind as yours.&#8212;Add to this, there
is no exportation of any consequence to <placeName>Europe </placeName><placeName>West India</placeName> produce
haveing declined there. It would have been better for us both if
you had shipped the Dollars, even if the duty was deducted.&#8212;You
will observe I charge no Commissions. I enclose your Acct. Currt.
by which you will see how the Interest swells the Ballance . . . [torn]
Business here, so that you must know well, how our <persName>British Creditors</persName>
charge us Interest up to the very day and the Interest we receive
but poorly reemburses us. I had on the Rect of your letter from
<placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, anticipated the Settlement of your acct and should
have been much pleased on transmitting you a Receipt in full, and
I rather suppose this might have been done, as I have been informed
you took . . . [torn] dollars home with you in Cash.</p>

<p>I still hope you will bear this acct. in mind and do, pray my good
Sir, forward the Ballance as quick as possible. Our politicall 
Ballance since the election of <persName>Governor McKean</persName> has all turned one
way, the <persName>Democratic </persName>Interest preponderates thro the <placeName>State </placeName>and even
our <placeName>City </placeName>has degenerated; I suppose the next election will be 
altogether on that side. <persName>George Wescott</persName> has been in very ill health
but is now better. <persName>Henry Wescott</persName> when on a visit to the <placeName>Copper
Mine in Maryland</placeName> last <date n="12-xx-1800">December</date>, fell down one of the <placeName>Shafts </placeName>36
feet and broke both his Legs&#8212; after laying on his back 4 Months,
he got home in <date n="05-xx-1801">May </date>and still in that position, and it is not till
within this month that he has been able to walk with Crutches;
indeed his Recovery is a Miracle&#8212; <persName>Bob Morris</persName> is at length at
large, he has obtained his Liberty by the Act of Bankruptcy.
<persName>Nickolson </persName>you might have heard died in <placeName>prison</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Shall be glad of a line when this gets to hand, and if you can
accompany it with something substantial in the money way, you
will render me a great service, and confer a great Obligation on</p>
