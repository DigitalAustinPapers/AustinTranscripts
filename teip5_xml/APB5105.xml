<p><hi rend="italic">Copy of a Letter to Col. D. C. Barrett.</hi></p>

<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, <date when="1836-01-17">Jan. 17, 1836</date>.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p><placeName>Texas </placeName>stands high all over this <placeName>country</placeName>. We have effected a loan for
<hi rend="italic">two hundred thousand</hi> dollars and expect to procure another for 40 or
50,000. The enclosed contract contains the terms of the first loan, it will
no doubt be ratified by the <persName>Convention </persName>as stipulated. The credit and 
prospects of the <placeName>country </placeName>will be totally ruined if it is not. The last news from
<placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> and <placeName>Tampico </placeName>is, that the <persName>Federal Party </persName>had united with <persName>Santa
Anna</persName> against <placeName>Texas</placeName>. This leaves us but one course, which is an absolute
Declaration of Independence. Such a measure is expected and called for
by the <persName>people of the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>, from one end of this union to the other.
We could not have obtained the loan here except on the firm belief by the
<persName>lenders </persName>that a Declaration of Independence would be made in <date n="03-xx-1836">March next</date>
by the <persName>Convention</persName>.</p>

<p>The negotiation that is now pending for another loan has been 
embarrassed by a rumor that there has been a <persName>mob at <placeName>San Felipe</placeName></persName> to destroy the
<persName>Government</persName>, and restore the old state of things under <placeName>Coahuila and Texas</placeName>.
I do not believe there has been any such thing. <placeName>Texas </placeName>must be united and
act together and in harmony and never recede one inch. It may perhaps
be necessary to stop and rest a while on the way, but never to retrace our<pb n="306"/>
political march. It must be <hi rend="italic">forward</hi>. The <placeName>country </placeName>has rested a short time
under the declaration of <date when="1835-11-07">7th November</date>, in order to look around and gain
a little more strength and a little more information as to the road yet to be
traveled over&#8212;and we are now ready for another move and a final one.
Whatever difference of opinion there may have been as to the time for this
move, I hope there will be none now. The <placeName>whole nation</placeName> of all <persName>parties </persName>are
against us; they have left us but one [course]&#8212;INDEPENDENCE&#8212; It
is now necessary as a measure of self defence. The <placeName>United States</placeName> as a
people are ready to sustain it&#8212;we shall sink in their estimation if we do
not adopt it.</p>

<p>My health is greatly improved&#8212; I wish it had been as good in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; I
should then have been more active and followed my- own impulses and
judgment, both of which are sufficiently indicated by my communications
of <date when="1835-11-30">30th November</date>, <date when="1835-12-02">2nd December</date> and letter to you about that time.
I shall try to be at <placeName>home </placeName>by the <date n="03-xx-1836">first week in March</date> and preach 
Independence.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin.</persName></p>
