<p><placeName>Velasco </placeName><date when="1836-06-27">Monday 27 June 36</date></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>After rolling at anchor nearly all day I have just landed&#8212; My head still
has the sea sick motion, so I can say but a few words in reply to your 
request, in your note to the <persName>president</persName>, to give you the news from the <placeName>U.S.</placeName></p>

<p>There is a general and pritty universal and ardent interest <placeName>all over the
U.S.</placeName> in favor of <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; This feeling pervades both houses of <persName>Congress</persName>
and the <persName>cabinet</persName>.</p>

<p>I believe that nothing was wanting to procure a recognition of our 
independence but <hi rend="italic">official manuscript accounts</hi> of the battle of <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> and
the actual state of things in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;Some proof of our capacity to sustain
ourselves etc. Nothing of the kind was rec'd&#8212;nothing but <placeName>newspaper </placeName>
accounts had reached there when I left.</p>

<p><persName>Grayson </persName>and <persName>Collingsworth </persName>took accounts to <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> that no more
<persName>volunteers </persName>were needed. This will do great harm and must be immediately
counteracted if we expect any more aid from there.</p>

<p>The reports about treating with <persName>Santa Anna</persName> etc have injured the cause
of <placeName>Texas </placeName>beyond anything you can conceive of.</p>

<p>Our course now appears to be a plain one. The <placeName>country </placeName>must rally
<hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> and meet the <persName>enemy</persName>. It seems that their creed is extermination.
If so, ought we to have faith in such an <persName>enemy </persName>or to extend mercy or favors?</p>

<p>A great error (as I think) has been committed in not communicating
with the <persName>agents of <placeName>Texas </placeName>in <placeName>Washington City</placeName></persName>. I recommend that a report
or an account in an official form be sent to them by every opportunity of
every important event that transpires.</p>

<p><persName>80 men</persName> ought to be at <placeName>Galveston </placeName><date when="1836-06-28">tomorrow </date>in the schooner San Jacinto
from <placeName>Orleans</placeName>&#8212;the <persName>men are from <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName></persName> commanded by <persName>Capt. Allen</persName>,
a fine fellow. <persName>300 </persName>more are on the way from <placeName>Lexington </placeName>and <placeName>Louisville</placeName>&#8212;
<persName>1000 </persName>more would have been on&#8212;but the report that "the war is ended" will
stop them.<pb n="373"/></p>

<p>In Gods name no more armistices or treaties with <persName>prisoners</persName>.</p>

<p>In the <placeName>Mississippi </placeName>I saw a vessel direct from <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>which confirms
the news rec'd here as to the advance of the <persName>Mexicans </persName>10,000 to <persName>12,000
</persName>strong. There is no doubt of it&#8212;all <placeName>Mexico </placeName>is in motion. No treaty made
with <persName>Santa Anna</persName> will be respected by them. <persName>Gen Urrea</persName> is <persName>commander in
chief</persName>.<persName> Gen Cortazar</persName> was at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>with <persName>5000 men</persName> and coming on by
forced marches. <persName>Gen Filisolo</persName> had rec'd orders to halt his retreat and
fight etc. Such is the substance of the news from <placeName>Matamoros</placeName>&#8212;also that
an <persName>expedition </persName>was fitting out by water. I shall try and be with you in the
<persName>army </persName>as soon as I can, as a <persName>private soldier</persName>&#8212; <persName>every man in <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> must
shoulder his arms. Farewell</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>Gen M B Lamar</persName></p>

<p><persName>Majr Gen. M. B. Lamar</persName></p>

<p>Permit me to suggest that it would be best to avoid (if possible) any
harsh treatment towards <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>'s person. In the present 
excitement perhaps this will be difficult, tho. you know more of the <hi rend="italic">temper of the
times</hi> than I do as to the matter.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
