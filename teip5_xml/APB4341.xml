<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1832-04-22">April 22d 1832</date></p>
<p><persName>Colonel S. F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir, The variety of subjects, on which I desired 
conversations, previous to your departure for the seat of Government; and
the little time allowed us, in the hurry of our interviews, one of
the most important subjects, was neglected, or forgotten.</p>

<p>Connected with the settlement of the <placeName>new colony</placeName>, (without regard
to the character of the settle [r]s, or the <placeName>nations </placeName>from which they<pb n="766"/>
may be taken,) the most important matter, is the improvement of
the <placeName>River Brasos</placeName>, (To say nothing, of the advantages, that must
accrue to the present <persName>settlers </persName>on said <placeName>River</placeName>,) This improvement, is
of vital importance, to the great interests of the <placeName>country </placeName>we inhabit;
and its accomplishment would give a new character, and a powerful
impulse to its growth.</p>

<p>If a grant can be obtained, by myself and company, to make the
said improvements for reasonable tolls, the work shall be finished
in two years, <placeName>From the head of tide water to the Waco village
</placeName>for boats, of twelve feet breadth; drawing thirty inches water.</p>

<p>With this reservation to the <placeName>State</placeName>, that it may, at any time, after
the completion of the work, possess itself of two thirds of the
improvements, by paying to the <persName>company </persName>two thirds of the amount
expended in making the same.</p>

<p>You know as well as myself, the importance of the undertaking;
and infinitely better, how to obtain the <placeName>grant</placeName>, on reasonable terms.
I will therefore confide its details to your management.</p>

<p>Have the goodness to let me hear from you on this subject, before
the <date when="1832-06-01">1st of June</date>; as I shall start for the <placeName>United States</placeName> at that time.
Should the <placeName>grant </placeName>be obtained, I will bring with me the force to
commence the work <date n="Fall-1832">next fall</date></p>

<p>Connected with this business, <persName>six of us</persName> have associated, to get
a small steam boat, calculated to draw thirty inches of water, with
an engine, of thirty five horse power, adapted to sawing timber
on board the Boat.</p>

<p>Nothing new in this <placeName>neighbourhood </placeName>since you left us.</p>

<p><persName>B. T. Archer</persName></p>
<p><persName>Colo S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:]   <persName>Colonel Stephen F. Austin </persName>   Mail <placeName>Leona  Vicario</placeName></p>
