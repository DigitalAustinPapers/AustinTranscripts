<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]</p>

<p><date when="1831-04-18">April 18. 1831</date></p>

<p>I have drawn on you this day for one hundred dollars in favor
of <persName>Mr. Joseph Powel</persName>, who let me have that amt. here. I think I can
get along with this. I should not have wanted any but I have agreed
to pay the office charges on the petitions that are pending from all
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, which will amt. to upwards of 200 dollars I expect.</p>

<p>The present <persName>governor </persName>has carefully separated from the petitions
all who are not <persName>native Mexicans</persName>, and will reject them all, he hates
all <persName>foreigners </persName>as he does the devil and he must hate the <persName>old boy
</persName>mortally for he is a <persName>fanatic en extremo</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Arciniega </persName>can safely go on and issue the titles, that had the 
restriction, there will be no difficulty altho no definite or satisfactory
answer could be had from the <persName>Govr</persName>. As a genl, rule you must tell
<persName>Arciniega </persName>never to consult on any subject, unless he wishes to get
himself and everybody else into trouble.</p>

<p>I have done all I could for <persName>Madero</persName>, which is as much as to say
that I have effected nothing, for this <persName>Govr</persName>. thinks that <persName>Madero </persName>is
a <persName>heretic </persName>and the more he suffers the better, as it will only be a
taste of hell in advance.   At <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>I may [do] something and<pb n="649"/>
will attend to it. Inform <persName>Madero </persName>of this, or if as I presume from
a hint I saw in one of your letters that you and <persName>Madero </persName>and his
<persName>Comitiva </persName>are at cross questions because a paper was sent through
another hand than yours, you can get <persName>Arciniega </persName>to communicate.</p>

<p>There is nothing new here since my last which was on the <date when="1831-04-16">16th&#8212;</date>
the retail bill is asleep and I think it probably will so remain. The
<persName>pasquinades </persName>that were put up against <persName>Aguirre </persName>have not had the
effect which the <persName>shop gentry</persName> expected, and I think the matter will
not be moved again.</p>

<p>I send <persName>Johnson </persName>two seals, such as are used in this place.</p>

<p><persName>S F Austin  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>I paid forty dollars on the <placeName>grants </placeName>which I sent by <persName>Rodriguez </persName>which
you must collect</p>

<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Mr. Samuel M. Williams</persName><placeName> San Felipe de Austin
</placeName><persName>Mr. Powel</persName></p>
