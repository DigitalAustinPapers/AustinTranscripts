<p><placeName>Nashville </placeName><date when="1826-11-01">Nov1" 1st 1826</date>.</p>
<p>My dear <persName>Judge</persName>.</p>

<p>After a lapse of several years since our first and only acquaintance
took place, and altho we have never since that time corresponded
with each other&#8212;on my part I have often turned my memory to
scenes and events in which you were a party concerned; and have
carefully noted the progress of your arduous and responsible 
undertaking with feelings anxious for your complete and full success.
I have had the pleasure several times of reading letters from you
to our common acquaintance <persName>Colo Erwin</persName>&#8212;in which you have 
somewhat in detail given a history of the progress of your <placeName>settlement</placeName>, your
views, prospects, etc and I feel well assured from my knowledge
of you that you will realize all you have anticipated.</p>

<p>My principal reason for addressing you at this time&#8212;is, to take
the liberty of introducing to your <persName>acquaintance </persName>my acquaintance
and <persName>friend </persName><persName>Colo Benjamin F. Foster</persName>, who will hand you this. <persName>Col°
Foster</persName> is a young <persName>gentleman </persName>of high character and respectability
in this <placeName>State </placeName>both on his own account, and the numerous respectable
<persName>connexions </persName>he has here. He has been selected by the <persName>Texas 
Association</persName> of this place to go out to <placeName>Texas </placeName>as their <persName>agent</persName>, for the 
purpose of procuring <persName>settlers </persName>on the <placeName>land granted to them by the 
<persName>Mexican Government</persName> </placeName>and make such other arrangements as will tend to
the benefit of the <persName>company</persName>.</p>

<p>A young man and a <persName>stranger</persName>&#8212;<placeName>in a foreign land</placeName>&#8212;he will no doubt
be much assisted by the <persName>council </persName>and advice which you my dear sir
will be able to give him, in relation to his undertaking; And I can
say to you with truth that you could not extend your kindness and
friendship to one more deserving of them than <persName>Col° Foster</persName>. And I
assure you my dear sir that it would be highly gratifying to me
that you would do so.</p>

<p>I have often thought of paying you a visit and may yet drop
unexpectedly upon you. I should much like to talk over our <placeName>Mexican</placeName>
connexion, and all the viscissitudes we have since underwent, which
I fondly hope will some time or other take place&#8212;perhaps your
business may at no distant day call you into <placeName>this part of the world</placeName>&#8212;
if so depend upon it I will not forego the opportunity of seeing you.
If you have an opportunity and are not too much engaged in forming
your new <placeName>settlement</placeName>, I would be very glad to receive a letter from
you&#8212;in which I would like to find all the little matters relating to
yourself particularly&#8212;whether you think of marrying&#8212;if you have
any prospect there&#8212;or whether you could not make an adventure
among us.    as also the general condition of your <placeName>settlement </placeName>and your<pb n="1486"/>
opinion as to its future advancement&#8212;Nothing connected with you
and your new <placeName>country </placeName>would be uninteresting, to me¡ who subscribes
himself,</p>

<p><persName>John D. Martin</persName>.</p>
<p><persName>Colo. S. F. Austin</persName>.   </p>
