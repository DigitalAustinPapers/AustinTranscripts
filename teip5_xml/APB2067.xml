<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have been much longer detained in this <placeName>Country </placeName>than I had any
Idea of when I started from your <placeName>settlement</placeName>, It was Six Weeks,
before we reached <placeName>Refugio</placeName>, and have been longer in Settling my
business than I had any Idea of. I then went up the <placeName>Country </placeName>and
bought Some Wool to bring on to the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>but by high waters
and loosing Mules and Horses, it is only the other day I was able to
get my Cargos and Mules Collected in <placeName>Camargo </placeName>to start, but am
again prevented by high waters all the <placeName>Water Courses</placeName> are up so
that mules with Cargo cannot proceed and I am uncertain when I will
be able to travel with my cargo there has been a great deal of Rain
in this <placeName>Country </placeName>the <placeName>Rio Grande</placeName> is very high and likewise the
<placeName>Nueces</placeName>; and as I am unable to proceed, I have concluded to go down
to <placeName>Refugio </placeName>and purchase a few goods, to see if I can make up my lost
time; I shall be with you as soon as it is practicable; as I have since
I first saw the <placeName>Country </placeName>been determined to become a <persName>Settler</persName>; and
have refused some good offers to make money, in consequence of
making all my arrangements to go and settle with you; I hope <persName>Captn
Jones</persName> has attended to my business and that all things are well my
absence from the <placeName>Colonies </placeName>has not been my fault; which I know you
are sensible of&#8212; If <persName>Captn Jones </persName>has not been able to pay you the
balance; I will settle with you to your satisfaction.</p>

<p><persName>James Grant</persName>.</p>
