<p>TO THE <persName>PRESIDENT OF THE CONVENTION OF <placeName>TEXAS</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>Sir,&#8212;I have the honor to inform you that the <persName>enemy</persName>, to the number of
about three hundred <persName>cavalry </persName>and one hundred <persName>infantry</persName>, as nearly as can<pb n="217"/>
be ascertained, with two pieces of cannon, at sunrise <date when="1835-10-28">this morning</date>, attacked
a <persName>detachment from the army</persName>, consisting of ninety <persName>men</persName>, under the command
of <persName>colonel Bowie</persName> and <persName>captain Fanning</persName>, who were posted at this place; and
after a warm engagement of three hours, were repulsed with the loss of one
piece of cannon, (a six-pounder) and about thirty muskets, sixteen <persName>men</persName>
left dead <placeName>on the field</placeName>, and, from the best accounts, nearly as many more
were carried off. The number of <persName>wounded </persName>we can only conjecture, with
the exception of two that remained <placeName>on the field</placeName>. It is with great regret I
have to say, that on our side we had one man, <persName>Richard Andrews, of <placeName>Mina</placeName></persName>,
dangerously wounded&#8212;I fear mortally. But we have sustained no other
loss, except a few horses.</p>

<p>The main body of the <persName>army </persName>came up, in about thirty minutes after the
<persName>enemy </persName>had retired. A more circumstantial account of this action, which
has resulted so gloriously to the <persName>federal army</persName>, and more particularly to the
individuals immediately engaged, will be given as soon as it can be
made out.</p>

<p>The overwhelming superiority of force, and the brilliancy of the victory
gained over them, speak for themselves in terms too expressive to require
from me any further eulogy</p>

<p>I have just learned that the <persName>cavalry of the enemy</persName> was commanded by
<persName>colonel Ugartechea</persName>, and the <persName>infantry </persName>by <persName>colonel Mariano Cos</persName>, <persName>brother of
the general, Martin Perfecto</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
