<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you by <date when="1830-06-23">yesterday</date>s mail though in the greatest haste and
having the present oportunity of immediate conveyance I again
request that you give me whatever information you may be in 
possession of as to the business of this <placeName>section </placeName>what will be the result
as to buisness already commenced, I am fearful we have lost in
<persName>Padilla </persName>more than we will easily regain or perhaps more that we
will at all who is the <persName>comisioner </persName>destined for this place and what
do you think of his appointment viz do you think he will suit us.</p>

<p>From what I have heard of your health I think you-would 
perhaps not do amiss to come and spend the sickly season with us on
the <placeName>Ayish byou</placeName> we will move in two or three days to that <placeName>section</placeName>
and would be sincerly glad If you could come and remain with us<pb n="431"/>
until the season Changes I shall then take a tour through the
<placeName>country </placeName>and go to the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>I am desirous of seeing <persName>Mr. Fisher
</persName>and getting some information necessary for commencing the 
coasting trade in the <date n="SPring - 1831">spring </date>or sooner If practicable your letters
directed to this place will be received without delay should I not be
here.</p>

<p><persName>Thomas F. McKinney </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>NB You mentioned somthing when I saw you last of the <persName>Chief
of Department</persName> having said to you somthing of the subject of 
receiving the appointment of <persName>Xefe de Partido</persName> of this part of the <placeName>Country</placeName>
I hope the plan has not been abandoned I am sure you could render
invaluable services to this <placeName>country </placeName>You have some enimies from
envious principles but the large majority would be gratified with
an arrangement of that kind As soon as I arrived from the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>
I wrote a single letter to each of the <placeName>districts </placeName>recommending to them
to petition to you to come on with the <persName>Commissioner </persName>and to 
subscribe to you for doing so subscriptions could not be circulated
before news arrived of the <persName>Comisioner </persName>leaving<placeName> St Philepe</placeName> though
considerably above a thousand Dollars were subscribed and three
times the amt would have been subscribed but on hearing he had left
<placeName>St Philipe </placeName>the matter was droped   respt</p>
