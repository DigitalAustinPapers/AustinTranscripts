<p><placeName>Brazoria </placeName><date when="1831-08-26">26 August /31</date></p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>My health is so far restored that I am on my way to the <placeName>mouth
of the River</placeName> for shells for my <placeName>buildings </placeName>and have hopes I have
conquered the desease&#8212; I have been extremely anxious about you
and [your] <persName>Sister's family</persName>, the fever is so prevalent that 
travelling in such intense heat as we have had is extremly hazardous,
to <persName>persons </persName>unacclimated and even to you who are so hardy&#8212; <persName>John</persName>
has brought on fever by riding <placeName>in the sun </placeName>but is nearly recovered&#8212;
It positively will not do for either myself or <persName>Mr Perry</persName> to think of
keeping our <persName>familys </persName>in <placeName>this part of the country</placeName> in the summer
months, the insects alone would drive them mad. They have 
operated upon me at <placeName>Bolivar </placeName>like a perpetual blister. I wish much
to accompany you to the <placeName>upper country</placeName> when you go. I beg you
will advise me of your movements&#8212; at present I have five <persName>men</persName>
under pay till the <date when="1831-09-10">10th proxo</date> and as nothing is done unless I am
present, I do not wish to leave until then, still should you go
sooner I would endeavour to join you.<pb n="691"/></p>

<p>I had hopes you would have taken your <persName>Sisters family</persName> to <placeName>Coles
Settlement</placeName> until the heats were over, would it not be best for
them to go there now ?&#8212;</p>

<p>Should you come to <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>do me the favor to let me know
when, if oppy offers for <placeName>Boliva</placeName>r</p>

<p>I have a letter from <placeName>Ware </placeName>altho he had no accounts from me he
had contracted for Machinery with the intention of working it in
<placeName>Louisiana </placeName>in case my report should be unfavorable for <placeName>Texas</placeName>, the
advise of the failure of a<placeName> house in Orleans </placeName>whose paper he held for
10600$ payable <date when="1831-06-01">1 June</date> here caused him to suspend the contract
until he could ascertain the result of that and his other <placeName>N Orleans
</placeName>papers this being part of the sum appropriated to <placeName>Texas </placeName>
Speculations, his letter was obviously written at the moment of receiving
the unpleasant news, as he seems to consider all his <placeName>Orleans paper
</placeName>in Jeopardy&#8212; so much for lending Money at 12 prct&#8212;the receipt
of my letters and ascertaining the actual extent of loss will probably
put him in better spirits</p>

<p>My best regards to <persName>Emily </persName>and Compes to <persName>Mr Perry</persName>&#8212;I will 
indeavour to visit <placeName>St Felepe </placeName>by the <date when="1831-09-15"><placeName>middle of Septr</placeName></date> at all events</p>

<p><persName>H Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col S F Austin</persName>   <placeName>St Felepe</placeName></p>
