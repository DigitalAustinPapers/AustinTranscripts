<p>Dr Sir;</p>

<p>I have taken considerable pains to find out whether or not the
<placeName>Military claims</placeName> contracted by the expedition of <persName>Gutierrez </persName>and <persName>Mener [Mina]</persName>
 are sanctioned by the <persName>Government </persName>I have been informed by
the Most correct source that they are I have even taken the pains
to wride a journey of sumthing like 300 Miles to inform myself More
particularly on that subject and find from information that Military
claims that were contracted in the campaigns of either of these two
gentlemen have an advantage over others If you can give me any
further information on the subject I would be glad you would do
so as you have a better source of information I have also another
request to ask of you which is this to write me by <persName>Mr. Chance</persName> whether
or not the <placeName>6th 7th and 8th leagues in Bay Prarara</placeName> are deeded away or
not or either of them I presume you have not reserved either of
them as I have understood you have relinquished your claims in
that <placeName>section of the Country</placeName> I have endeavoured to find out the
<persName>proprieters </persName>of those <placeName>leagues </placeName>but never found any I hope you will
therefore have no objection in letting me know whether they are
deeded away or not and who to and where the claimants reside I
am thus explicit because I do intend to lay my claims in this <placeName>colony</placeName>
if possible and am entitled to every advantage that the <persName>Government</persName>
allows me I am in hopes you will be candid and give me your
opinion for I do not wish to delay time untill the <placeName>province </placeName>is picked
and culled and then take the refuse when I am informed that 
<placeName>Military Claims</placeName> have the prefferance which if so it is by an order of the
<persName>Govt </persName>and I have a right to provide for myself I think I recollect
sumthing of the kind in the old Colonization Law</p>

<p>I wish to do nothing but what is right in this case, and will loose
no pains in informing myself which I can probably do in <placeName>Labahia</placeName>
so that I may not Err I want to lay my Claim on the <placeName>7th and 8th
leagues in B. Prarara</placeName> so that I may get off <placeName>of your reserve</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Aylett C. Buckner.</persName></p>

<p>N B. <persName>Mr. Powel</persName> wishes to know whether you intend giving him
land or not and where   he is willing to take that you intended for
<persName>Sarver   </persName>he wishes you to inform him as soon as possible for he wants
to know where his <placeName>land </placeName>is to be if any that he May improve it   he
says you made sum objection in Consequence of [which he?] talked
of going to the <placeName>Guadaloupe </placeName>but he says he has your letter to show
you offered him land sum time ago before you made any close of
your business   he says you reinstated him upon the same footing as
at first.</p>

<p><persName>A. C. Buckner</persName>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo S. F Austin</persName> <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName></p>
