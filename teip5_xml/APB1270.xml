<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I have this moment received your letter= I am fully convinced
and always have been of the necessity and importance of the <persName>Baron</persName>s
Speedy return to the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;I know his long absence has caused
you much uneasiness of mind&#8212;But I am sorry you think that your
anxiety, is a subject of "<hi rend="italic">mirth </hi>and " <hi rend="italic">Ridicule </hi>" for me I can assure
you it is not, nor ever has been&#8212; my object when I have seen you
in such low spirits has only been to divert your attention to 
something else and prevent your absolutely <hi rend="italic">dying </hi>with melancholy</p>

<p>I have concluded to go to <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>first as I have to go by 
<placeName>Monterrey </placeName>to go to <placeName>San Carlos</placeName>&#8212;owing to the drought&#8212;the <placeName>lower Route</placeName>&#8212;
If there is any possible way of getting the <persName>Baron </persName>off I will do so
and bring him on immediately I saw a <persName>gentleman (Yturri)</persName> direct
from <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>he says the <persName>Baron </persName>is Extremely anxious to return&#8212;
but thinks he cannot untill <date n="12-xx-1826">Decembr </date>at any rate   I will go and see&#8212;</p>
<pb n="1446"/>

<p>Try and Keep the <persName>Slave holders</persName> from going until they hear the
result of the <persName>Slave </persName>question-&#8212; Tell them they are safe yet&#8212;and
there is but little doubt but part of the laws will be favourable&#8212;that
is&#8212;what&#8212;relates to the <persName>Slaves </persName>already in the <placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212; The
<persName>Ayuntam </persName>of this place have made as <hi rend="italic">Warm </hi>a Representation in
favor of it as you have&#8212; Your Representation is thought well
of&#8212;the attempt to comitt such an outrage on the rights of the 
<persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212;-(they say) perfectly justifies you in expressing your feelings
in the strongest terms&#8212;they have done the same&#8212; You will receive
a Copy of the Represenon&#8212;they have made this mail&#8212; The <persName>Cabildo</persName>
are quite Sanguine of obtaining a favorable <persName>slave </persName>law&#8212; I had a
relapse a few days ago&#8212;and am so weak can hardly write&#8212; I shall
start however <date when="1826-09-04">to morrow </date>in company with what <persName>Americans </persName>are here&#8212; and a <persName>convoy </persName>going to <placeName>Laredo</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Respects to <persName>Williams</persName>&#8212;sorry to hear he has been in such low
health&#8212;would write him but have no&#8212;time&#8212; Remr me to <persName>Mrs
Picket </persName>and <persName>Elisa</persName></p>

<p><persName>J. B. Austin</persName></p>

<p>You may direct your next letter to <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>P. S<persName>&#8212;Martin de Leon</persName> has just arrived I do not know the object
of his Visit&#8212;</p>

<p>I shall see <persName>D.n Victor</persName> and you can write me in <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>if you could
make any arrangement to buy&#8212;the <placeName>mill</placeName>&#8212;for any thing but Cash
