<p><persName>Mr James F Perry</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir. On my arrival here I found a <persName>Mr Bradley</persName> here with a
note of our friend <persName>Col Austin</persName> for something upwards of 700$ which
has been due some months, and which would have been paid ere this
but from the necessity of providing funds for him in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>

<p>After his arrest he wrote to me and requested me to dispose of his
property to provide means for him, he has also sent you a letter of
attorney for the same purpose. As yet I have not found it necessary
to make any sale nor do I believe it will be necessary for I can 
continue to raise means for all his wants in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and he has authority
to draw for another thousand dollars over and above what he has
drawn for, and this note is the only one he has out&#8212;</p>

<p>I find that at this place there is no money to be had at the moment.
<persName>Mr White</persName> at <placeName>Columbia </placeName>is likewise destitute if you have as much as
500$ by you I wish you would advance, it, and should you require it
in the <date n="Winter-1834">winter </date>I can return it to you, and if you should want in <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> I can manage to furnish it to you there, if you have it I
should like to hear from you immediately&#8212;I can get along with the
sum mentioned.</p>

<p>I am happy to state that there is a wonderful reaction in favor of
the <persName>Col.</persName> and altho some what tardily I am proud in the Conviction
that his <persName>Colonists </persName>are disposed to do him justice.</p>

<p>Present me kindly to your family.</p>
