<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>I avail myself of the departure of <persName>Mr Wm. Bryan</persName> to forward you some
public Documents and papers which I hope and trust may wile away a
leisure hour&#8212;</p>

<p>I have much to say to you that cannot well be included within the narrow
limits of a letter&#8212; I must however congratulate you on the Prospect before
you, never in my opinion has <placeName>Texas </placeName>stood upon the same high ground in
the estimation of <placeName>civilized nations</placeName> that she does at this Moment&#8212; Another
revolution in <placeName>Mex</placeName>. must inevitably be the result of the recent struggle in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, will ward off any immediate apprehension of Danger from 
invasion ; the great and glorious resolutions of the <persName>Senate and H of R</persName> will have
in a moral point of view a greater bearing on your fate, than all which has
preceded it; add to this the interest which the <persName>Press in <placeName>England </placeName></persName>has taken
in your cause and the whole will I think justify the remark above Made&#8212;
that you now stand on higher ground than you ever have done before.&#8212;
Yet my dear Sir, I have my doubts and fears&#8212;and they arise not from your
external foes but from your <persName>enemies </persName>within&#8212; You have had from strong
necessity a class of people thrown among you, who when the excitement
ceases which collected them, will exhibit the evils attendant on ill organised
minds and unbridled passions.</p>

<p>I know of nothing that would be so favourable for <placeName>Texas </placeName>at this moment
as the election of yourself as <persName>Presdt of the <placeName>Republic</placeName></persName>&#8212; I not only give this
as my own opinion but I have it corroborated by some of the best 
authorities in <placeName>Washtn</placeName>- That such an election would hasten the proclamation of
the <persName>President</persName>, acknowledging your Independence is VERY CERTAIN.</p>

<p><persName>Mr Bryan</persName> who will deliver you this has been shamefully treated by the
<persName>existing government of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>. The Current of public opinion runs strongly
in his favour here and against the intrigues and Maneouvers which 
appointed his <persName>succesor</persName>. On this subject however you are well informed&#8212; I
tell you from my personal Knowledge that <persName>Mr Bryan</persName> stood by your cause
in its gloomiest moments while his successor proved recreant to it.<pb n="405"/></p>

<p>In conclusion I again congratulate you upon what I consider a happy
state of your affairs</p>

<p><persName>Jas Ramage</persName></p>

<p>The <persName>Honble S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Texas</placeName></p>

<p>P. S. I saw nothing of <persName>A&#8212;r</persName> when he was here and but little of <persName>W&#8212;n&#8212;</persName>
indeed I felt no inclination to see either&#8212;upon you and the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>
now depends your salvation.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] The <persName>Honble S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Texas </placeName>by <persName>Mr. Bryan</persName>.</p>
