generosity from the <persName>Executive of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>. Per Schr Flora you&#8212;<persName>Dr Archer</persName>
and <persName>Col Wharton</persName> will receive packages of papers,</p>

<p>Also I send you two of this date. No late arrivals from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. By
the arrival of <persName>Mr Hamecan</persName>, I had the pleasure to learn your safe arrival
and trust to receive advices from you next vessel</p>
