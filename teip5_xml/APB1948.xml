because it tends to disaffect colonists who feel strong loyalty to Mexico. They
do not want to belong to the united States. The law will not affect Austin's
colony, however, where immigration will continue as before. Terán the

<p>To <persName>Capt. Henry Austin&#8212;</persName></p>

<p>My dear Sir&#8212;I have never heard what was the result of your
application for a <placeName>grant of land</placeName> which you informed me you had
presented to the <persName>Govt of this State</persName>&#8212;have you received any answer ?
I presume you have of course seen the law of the <date when="1830-04-06">6th of April</date>&#8212; that
law will be a <hi rend="italic">dead letter</hi> in <placeName>Texas </placeName>so far as regards my <placeName>colony </placeName>for
the 10th Article covers me entirely:<pb n="405"/></p>

<p>A more impolitic measure could not have been adopted by this
<persName>Govt</persName>&#8212; All the <persName>new settlers</persName> were opposed to a change of Govt or a
sale of <placeName>Texas </placeName>to the <placeName>U. S</placeName>.&#8212;they were becoming sincerely attached
to this <persName>Govt</persName> and they always have been faithful and always would
be&#8212; This <persName>Govt </persName>has a stronger hold on <placeName>Texas </placeName>in the respect which
the <persName>new settlers</persName> have for their oaths to support the constitution of
their <placeName>adopted country</placeName>, than any hold which a <persName>military </persName>force could
give them&#8212; I wish you to write when the long expected <persName>army of
<placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> is to be on, and its number etc&#8212; I now believe that the
Federal constitution will fall and that the Govt will assume an
arristocratical or monarchical form&#8212; I know not what will be the
ultimate fate of <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; I am myself opposed to a union with the
<placeName>U. S</placeName>. unless we first receive some <hi rend="italic">guarantees</hi>, amongst them I should
insist on the perpetual exclusion of slavery from this <placeName>country </placeName>write
me how you are getting on, whether you can visit <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; Are you
friendly with <persName>Teran</persName>&#8212; he and myself are on the very best of terms&#8212;
he has committed a capital error in advising the present measures
against <placeName>Texas</placeName>, for the fact is he is the <persName>author </persName>of them although he
has no idea that I am apprised of that fact&#8212; <hi rend="italic">I have always known
it</hi>&#8212; The most perfect peace and harmony reigns all over <persName>Texas </persName>and
will no doubt so continue&#8212; The timorous will hesitate about 
immigrating here, but all who are fully informed on the subject will
not,&#8212;for the fact is there is nothing to fear, neither will any
embarrissments be interposed to stop emigration to my <placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212;
I have letters of late date from <persName>Arch </persName>and <persName>John P Austin </persName><hi rend="italic">all well</hi></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin.</persName>
