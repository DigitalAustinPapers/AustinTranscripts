<p><date when="1829-04-16">April 16&#8212;[1829]</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I have not yet heard of the arrival of the <persName>comr </persName>at <placeName>St Antonio</placeName>,
tho I expect he has arrived there, and I think it probable that he will
be here some time <date n="05-xx-1829">next month</date>&#8212;he will not be able to attend to 
business for some time after his arrival here&#8212;I shall advertise the time
when he will be ready to receive applications, and it will be 
necessary for <persName>Mrs Powel</persName> to come up at that time</p>

<p>I find that it will be necessary for me to insist that the 
<persName>commissioner </persName>shall attend to the duties which the law requires him to attend<pb n="206"/>
to, and if he does so, I shall be totally relieved from the vexation of
distributing land to the <persName>settlers</persName>, for the law imposes all that duty on
the <persName>commissioner</persName>, but heretofore the <persName>comr </persName>imposed it all on me&#8212;he
will be compelled to form some general rules on the subject and to
follow them with very great rigor, or there will be much confusion.
I wish to get a complete list of all those who have not yet recd
land, in order to convince the <persName>commissioner </persName>of the necessity of his
staying here untill the business is all finished, for if I do not do this,
he will only remain a short time and leave me as the other 
<persName>commissioners </persName>have [be]fore the business is half finished&#8212;I have [asked]
the favor of <persName>Mr Ingram</persName> to get a list of all in that <placeName>section</placeName>, and I
must ask the favor of you to aid him in doing so&#8212;</p>

<p>Things are getting on better here, and there is some more harmony
than there was&#8212; The <persName>people </persName>must be more particular in electing a
man for <persName>Alcalde</persName>&#8212;If it will not injure you too much I think you
ought to be the next <persName>Alcalde</persName>&#8212;-many persons speak of you&#8212;in fact I
do not think there would be any opposition at all&#8212; I have been
spoken to by many, and I wish to get that idea out of their heads,
for I am compelled to visit the <placeName>United States</placeName> <date n="Fall-1829">next fall</date>, and I shall
spend the season there&#8212; It will not do for me to be <persName>Alcalde</persName>&#8212; I
have not the same patience that I once had&#8212; I have also other
things to attend to of much more importance to the <placeName>colony </placeName>than
settling little <placeName>neighborhood </placeName>disputes about cows and calves-
There are some erronious impressions about the <persName>Ayuntamiento</persName>,
amongst the <persName>settlers</persName>&#8212;those kind of impressions are very injurious
and ought to be corrected<persName>&#8212;Mr Ingram</persName> can give you much 
information on [this?] and I will promptly afford all the information in my
power to any one who will [write] me or take the trouble to inquire&#8212;
Our <placeName>Academy </placeName>subscription goes on very well there is over 1300
dollars subscribed and I think we shall be able to get a <placeName>brick 
building.</placeName> I am anxious to see the matter succeed for I think it will be
attended with much public good</p>

<p>I will be down and try and spend some time in that <placeName>quarter </placeName>after
the <persName>commissioner </persName>arrives&#8212;</p>

<p>My respects to <persName>Mrs Bell </persName>                           <persName> S. F. Austin</persName> [Rubric]</p>
