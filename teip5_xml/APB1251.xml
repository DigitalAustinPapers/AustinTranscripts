<p><placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName> <date when="1826-08-21">August 21st 1826</date></p>
<p><persName>Col Steven F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear <persName>Colonel </persName>I beg leave to call on you for information on 
certain points Relative to the Conduct of some of your <persName>people</persName>.</p>

<p>when <persName>Col Pettis</persName> was at <placeName>Ayish Bayou</placeName> he asserted there was no law
nor authority in <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>and that <persName>Jose Anty Sauceda Esqr</persName>. had
no authority to do what he Done and that your <persName>Honer </persName>had Command
to the <placeName>River Sabine</placeName> by which he stimulated the <persName>Opposers of the
Law</persName> and authority to Raise a <persName>Company </persName>for that purpose promising
them you would Recognize them for which <persName>John A Williams</persName> went
to the <placeName>Brassos</placeName></p>

<p>And by the Last mail <persName>John Sprowl Esqr</persName>. of the <placeName>Ayish Bayou</placeName> has
Recd a Letter as he states from <persName>Jesse Thomson</persName> and <persName>Payton </persName>in the
hand write of <persName>Joseph white</persName> and Bound him to profound Secrecy on
which the said <persName>Sprowl</persName>s prophicied that <placeName>one half of your Colony</placeName> and
the <persName>people </persName>here would be out of the <placeName>Country </placeName>he was askd If they
would be drove out he answered no they would go out of their
Own accord I insisted on knowing If it was anything that might
Effect the <persName>Government </persName>or the interest of the people he Refused
to answer me But Told <persName>Mr. Thomas</persName> It was the subject of Slavery
and that no hope Remained on that Subject thereby Creating much
Rumor</p>

<p>from what I have seen and heard among the <persName>friends of Edwards</persName>
and many others and now from your <placeName>Quarter </placeName>I am led to believe
something like a Revolution has been aimed at and probably yet
on foot<pb n="1429"/></p>

<p>I beg you to write me on those points and Explain those 
particulars so as no more Confusion may arise to the injury of the
<persName>Government </persName>your <placeName>Colony </placeName>nor here.</p>

<p>Please inform me If <persName>Mr. David G Burnett</persName> is yet with you he
wrote me a Letter when I was sick and before I was able to answer
I heard he had left your <placeName>Colony</placeName>, But If he should yet be with you
give him my Compliments and inform him I am Ready to 
Correspond with him and serve him in all cases in my power agreeable
to the Duty Of a <persName>friend</persName></p>

<p>                             <persName>Jas Gaines</persName></p>
