<p><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Saltillo</placeName></hi></p>
<p>My dear Sir.</p>

<p>Since my last via <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>new matter has occurred of very
serious import. The enclosed " Notice to <persName>Immigrants</persName>" put a dead
stop to the emigration and I was told the orders of the <persName>minister </persName>went
farther than the notice. I called upon the <persName>Consul </persName>for information;
He showed me the <persName>minister</persName>s officio from <placeName>Washington </placeName>and <persName>General
Teran</persName>s on the same subject. The <persName>minister </persName>says the <date when="1830-04-06">law of 6 april
</date>has no exception in favor of the <placeName>Colonys of Austin and Dewit</placeName> [and
for] him to publish the notice and the concluding clause is " those
who have obtained a location there since the publication of that law
(being of the <placeName>U S</placeName>.) <hi rend="italic">are liable to be expelled at the pleasure of the
<persName>Govt</persName></hi>"   This clause the <persName>Consul </persName>suppressed because he thought it<pb n="633"/>
unjust towards you and because it did not correspond with the 
instructions of <persName>Genl Teran</persName> whose <hi rend="italic">orders; no, not orders, instructions
</hi>he was instructed by Govt to follow in all matters relating to <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
He then shewed me <persName>General Teran</persName>s officio, which tells him not to
grant pasports for <placeName>Texas </placeName>to any <persName>emigrants </persName>but <hi rend="italic">" los qe dependen
a las colonias"</hi> of <placeName>Austin</placeName> and <placeName>Dewit </placeName>I endeavourd to construe the
word dependence as applicable to all who were bonafide destined to
those <placeName>colonies</placeName>, he took fire at this and I had to back out admitting
my imperfect knowledge of the.<persName>Spanish </persName>language I then took the
ground that the publications and notices by letters, that <persName>persons</persName>
qualified according to law, who should present themselves at <placeName>Sta
Felipe</placeName> during the term of your contracts should receive lands 
agreeably to law, was virtually a contract between you and them and
brought them within the exception. He said you had undoubtedly
agents in all parts of the <placeName>country </placeName>to pick up <persName>Settlers </persName>and all who had
contracted with them might go. I assured him there were no such
<persName>agents</persName>. He then said if I could produce a copy of a notice or a
letter or a note from <persName>Mr Breedlove</persName> that he had knowledge notice
had been given, he would consider it as an engagement with the
<persName>emigrants </persName>and grant them passports. Your letter of <date when="1830-01-19">Jany 19 1830
</date>to <persName>Mr Breedlove</persName> contained a postscript exactly in point. <persName>Mr B</persName> wrote
him a note which I handed him and obtained a reply a copy of which
I annex. This removes the difficulty here for the present but will
not counteract the effect in the <placeName>country </placeName>where you will see it is
ordered to be published He expressed the most friendly disposition
towards you and the <placeName>colonys</placeName>, said the Govt could not pass ex post
facto laws, and stopping the emigration to your <placeName>colonies </placeName>would be
ex post facto etc. but they are doing the thing whatever they may
say. He professes to coincide with me in opinion that the Govt
has no disposition to deviate from the just and liberal policy 
heretofore shown to the <persName>colonists</persName>, appeared anxious to convince me that
his personal disposition was the best possible, and published these
notices only by Superior order so I got along with him very
smoothly.</p>

<p>In my own affairs I am at a dead stand still<persName> Mr. W</persName>. about whose
propositions to establish a <placeName>Cotton factory</placeName> of a 1000 spindles in the
<placeName>Colony </placeName>I wrote you via <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>made it a sine qua non, that I
should take the direction of the business or he would not embark
in it, I acceded, conditionally, we matured the plan, agreed upon
terms, and were to reduce the matter to contract so soon as I had
advices that my solicitation was granted,&#8212; <persName>Buy</persName>s story that he had
the exclusive right to establish <placeName>cotton manufactorys</placeName> in <placeName>Texas </placeName>not
true and assurances that a premium in land would be granted for
the establishment of the <placeName>cotton factory</placeName> of 1000 spindles no advices<pb n="634"/>
came, altho it is three months since your arrival in <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and six
weeks since my letters on this subject. My friend is getting uneasy
at these consular notices, impatient of so much delay and has
gone to day to attend the sale of a <placeName>sugar plantation</placeName>. If he buys
it it will absorb 200,000 dollars of his Capital and I shall be thrown
out of the saddle after all besides if the<persName> minister</persName>s construction of
the law is to obtain, we cannot get a legal title to land enough
to [settle] the <placeName>manufactory </placeName>upon. However whichever way things
turn I must take a hand in the game somehow or other. I hope
I may soon hear from you as I have already been here two months
on expense and must soon be in action or raise the wind.</p>

<p>[Inclosure]</p>

<p>Copy of a Letter from the <persName>Mexican Consul</persName></p>

<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1831-03-30">March 30&#8212;1831</date>.</p>

<p><persName>Mr J. W. Bredlove</persName></p>

<p>Sir I have recd your letter of this morning in answer to it I
inform you that I will have no kind of objection to give passports
to any person whatsoever, if you will send me by those Persons an
assurance that they are going to<placeName> <persName>Mr Austin</persName>s Colony</placeName> to settle, It has
never been my intention to refuse granting passports to <persName>Persons</persName>
going to <placeName>Texas </placeName>on their private business or with a view of seeing the
country.</p>

<p><persName>Frano Pizarro Martinez</persName></p>

<p>[By Henry Austin:] ps <date when="1831-04-02">April 2d</date>&#8212;I have just recd your favor
of <date when="1831-03-05">March 5th</date> <persName>Mr W</persName> has not yet concluded the purchase of the
<placeName>Sugar plantation</placeName> but is in treaty for it I may yet do something with
him. <persName>Tailor </persName>has purchased and paid 50.000$ cash&#8212;I shall leave
this for the <placeName>colony </placeName>shortly. The consular notices and reports
that<persName> Mexican troops</persName> in great numbers are pouring into the <placeName>colony</placeName>
are doing much harm. <persName>Morgan </persName>and <persName>Reed </persName>have given up their 
intention of going out altho they had made purchases and <persName>Reed </persName>had
come from<placeName> North Carolina</placeName>. The <persName>consul </persName>told them they could not
take their <persName>negroes </persName>there on any terms&#8212;and that <persName>Genl Teran</persName> was
going to the <placeName>colony </placeName>to inforce the law and set all <persName>negroes </persName>free that
had been taken there contrary to law etc.</p>

<p>I find it in vain to combat the many reports afloat here, some of
which are that the <persName>colonists </persName>will have to fight for their <placeName>lands </placeName>or
lose them, that the <persName>Govt </persName>is determined to drive them out etc. These
reports have a bad effect every way, those who have money do not
like to hazard it where there is but little security.</p>
