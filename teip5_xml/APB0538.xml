<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>permit me to address a few lines to you to inform you that I and
family is well at present - We have had severall reports respecting<pb n="546"/>
you since you have left <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> some was that you were Drowned
others killed by <persName>Indians </persName>and some affirmed that you were actually
dead all of which I have endeavoured to silence as soon as possible I
haveing heard better by some fiew who wished to tell the truth -
the emigration is considerably stoped to that country for the 
present in consiquence of the badness of the crops on the <placeName>Brazos and
Colorado Rivers</placeName> still there appears to be a considerable number who
wishes to go on -</p>

<p>A great many is very anxious to know the system of government
which now exists and whether slavery is abolished or not a good
many appear to wish that it may be a free country from slavery
others in favour of slavery I wish you to forward me a fiew lines
as soon as possible with as generall a sketch of the existing 
government as possable -</p>

<p>the <persName>bearers </persName>of these lines is from all appearance both gentlemen of
respectablety and candar and if they should need any of your 
interference I think them worthy of your attention -</p>

<p><persName>Hugh McGuffin</persName></p>

<p>To <persName>Mr S. F. Austin</persName></p>
