<p><placeName>San Antonio</placeName> <date when="1826-08-23">23. August 1826</date>.</p>
<p>Dr sir,</p>

<p>I came here <date when="1826-08-17">last thursday evening</date> in Company with your <persName>Brother</persName>
and <persName>others</persName>, your <persName>Brother</persName>, myself and <persName>others </persName>of the <persName>Company </persName>have
been very unwell tho we are all on the mend. <persName>Capt. Bowen</persName> and <persName>Mr.
Moor</persName> are also mending. There is considerable Sickness here amongst
the <persName>soldiers </persName>and <persName>inhabitants</persName>.</p>

<p>Your <persName>Brother </persName>has written you relative to the suspension of <persName>Genl
San Bernardo</persName>, and the appointment of your friend <persName>Bustemantas </persName>to
the office of <persName>Comt- General</persName>, in his stead&#8212;He has also given you all
the information that has been recd> here in relation to the <persName>Slaves</persName>
and <persName>Slave </persName>Law.</p>

<p>I am happy to learn that you have recovered your health; and
regret to hear that <persName>Mr. Williams</persName> has been so very sick&#8212;hope he has
ere this recovered.</p>

<p><persName>Delion </persName>has Commited some atrocious Outrages on some <persName>American
travelers</persName> who were on the way here on business with the Govt-
What the result will be I am not able to say. I shall lay the
Memorial of <persName>Mr. Stout</persName> before the <persName>Chief </persName>to day relative to <persName>Delion</persName>s
ill treating and robing of him.</p>

<p>I find the <persName>Chief </persName>to be a man of easy access, and is very afible with
me It appears that he (the chief) is Determined to Consider
<persName>Delion</persName>, An <persName>Empresario </persName>Over an <placeName>undefined District</placeName> for 40 <persName>familes</persName>;
and wishes the<placeName> bounds between <persName>Dewitt </persName>and <persName>Delion</persName></placeName> to be agreed ou
between themselves.</p>

<p>I have proposed to let <persName>Delion </persName>Go <placeName>Eastward to the Grassite [Gar-
citas], and up and Down the Guadalupe</placeName> for quantity; giving to
<persName>Dewitt </persName><placeName>all the Labacca</placeName>; but he will not make an order to that effect,
without the consent of <persName>Delion</persName>, or the consent of the <persName>Commissioner </persName>on
the part of <persName>Delion</persName>, who is not yet appointed. It appears to me that
<persName>Dewitt </persName>will have to appeal to the Govt to obtain his right; this 
however will I presume Depend on the advice you may give on the
subject.</p>

<p>The <persName>Chief </persName>has promised to furnish the fee bill to me, to Day.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to your <persName>Brother </persName>for his polite attention, and
assistance here,</p>

<p>I have mentioned to the <persName>Chief </persName>the propriety of inviting <persName>fields </persName>to
partisipate in the War against the hostile <persName>Indians</persName>; he said that he
had written to him to come here and to bring his title papers to <placeName>land</placeName>
if he had any with a view to assertain the strength of his claim, and
to make some arrangements with him in assisting to Defend the
<placeName>frontiers</placeName>.   He requested me to write <persName>fields </persName>on the subject by the first<pb n="1436"/>
oppertunity and urge him to come on. The mail leaves here <date when="1826-08-24">to
morrow</date>, and I somewhat expect I shall do so too; but I cannot say
when I shall be able to get to <placeName>San felipe</placeName>.</p>

<p>You will perceive from reading this that my mind is too weak and,
Ideas too scattering to write. A few nights ago I Dreamd, that the
last object of my hopes was laid<placeName> beneath the Sod on the Gloomy hill
in the prairie near San felipe</placeName>: This with other difficulties keeps me
in Despair</p>

<p>My Respects to <persName>Mr &amp; Mrs pettes</persName> also <persName>Mrs Williams</persName> and <persName>Wightman</persName></p>

<p><persName>James Kerr</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] Al <persName>Tente Coronl. Estevan F. Austin.</persName> En <placeName>Sn. Felipe
de Austin</placeName>                           </p>
