<p><date when="1830-12-03">Dec. 3. 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr E. R. Weightman</persName></p>

<p>Dr Sir <persName>Mr Brush</persName> has entered his <placeName>quarter </placeName>I perceive that the
<placeName>29th, 30 and 31st leagues on Trespalacios</placeName>, as you have returned them
in the book of that Creek <placeName>cross the trespalacios creek</placeName>   I know not<pb n="549"/>
whether this will interfere with the place <persName>Mr Brush</persName> wants&#8212;the <placeName>29th
league</placeName> is deeded to the <persName>heirs of Richard Graves</persName> as you have returned
it and cannot be altered&#8212;the <placeName>30. and 31. are still vacant</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Brush</persName>es
can cross the <placeName>bayou </placeName>if it will not interfere with other tracts</p>

<p>The <placeName><persName>Bowman </persName>and <persName>William</persName>s League on the East of Colorado</placeName> next
<placeName>below <persName>Betts </persName></placeName>is not run as I gave you the memorandum, and the 
consequence is that the <placeName>quarter which was selected by <persName>John McLarren</persName>
</placeName>will be nearly all taken on the front by <persName>Bowman </persName>and <persName>Williams</persName>&#8212;
their League was deeded in the <placeName>old colony</placeName> and the lines cannot now
be altered&#8212; Agreeably to the deed it begins <placeName>at Betts lower corner
thence ST. 62E 5500 vars thence S. 28E to a point from which a line
S. 62. W. to the river </placeName>will make one League&#8212; by refering to the
plot you will see that this will cut off more than <placeName>half the front of
<persName>McLarren</persName>'s quarter</placeName>&#8212; I sent you the notes of this league and am
surprised that it was not run in conformity&#8212; it must be so run
and the fraction between it and <persName>E. Hall</persName> must then be calculated and
plotted in a quarter it will be in a triangular shape with a very
narrow front on the river&#8212; Explain this to <persName>McLarren </persName>without
delay so that he can choose another quarter if he doesnt like to take
the same after the correction is made&#8212; I have not made an exact
calculation but think that <persName>Bowman </persName>and <persName>Williams </persName>will leave but a
<placeName>few hundred yards above <persName>Hall</persName>s upper corner&#8212;</placeName> As I have said this
tract must be run as it was first deeded, no alteration can be made at
all in it</p>

<p><persName>S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>I shall start on the <date when="1830-12-15">15 of this month</date> positively&#8212; Send me the
notes or begining of <placeName><persName>Brush</persName>es tract</placeName> is you can do so&#8212;that I may
finish his deed</p>

<p><persName>A</persName></p>
