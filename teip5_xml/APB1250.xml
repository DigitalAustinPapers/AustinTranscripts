<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName><date when="1826-08-21"> Augt. 21, 1826</date>
</p>
<p>Dr <persName>Sister</persName>,</p>

<p>I embrace the opportunity by <persName>Col. Matson</persName> to drop you a line, he
has promised to stay one night at <placeName><persName>Mr Perry</persName>s</placeName> and as he has seen a
good deal of this <placeName>country </placeName>he can give you information relative to it&#8212;
<persName>Brother </persName>has taken a trip into the <placeName>interior </placeName>about six hundred miles
and I do not expect him back before <date n="01-xx-1827">January</date>, he started <date when="1826-08-01">three weeks
ago</date> and I have heard from him once, he was well&#8212;the affairs of the
<placeName>colony </placeName>are going on tolorably well tho imigration is not very rapid
we have had some difficulties with the <persName>Indians </persName>which no doubt are
very much magnified <placeName>abroad</placeName>, they are not serious and I think will
soon terminate, the <persName>tribe </persName>that troubles us is not over 200 strong and
their depredations are confined to stealing horses, you need not be at
all uneasy about any reports you hear on this subject&#8212;we have had
some sickness owing to an unusual wet season, tho but few deaths
and those confined to new comers&#8212;</p>

<p>The constitution of this <placeName>State </placeName>will be finished shortly and when I
see it I can give <persName>Mr Perry</persName> more certain advice as to the prospect of
a removal here, and untill then I do not wish him to derange his
business where he is by making any preparations for a removal&#8212;</p>

<p>I have heard by report that the suit between <persName>Price</persName> and <persName>Sam1 Perry</persName>
has been decided in favor of <persName>Perry</persName>&#8212;if so does it not fully decide
the principle that the whole <placeName>Estate </placeName>can be recovered? I have not
heard from you since the <date when="1826-01-08">8 of January</date> and feel very anxious to know
the particulars&#8212;My prospects of making a fortune here are bad, I
shall be but poorly compensated tho. expect to pay my debts and
make a comfortable support for my old age&#8212;If <persName>brother </persName>succeeds in
procuring Stock as he expects and which is the object of his journey
I shall settle down on a stock farm and perhaps follow the example
of <persName>Mr Perry</persName> and hunt a jolly old <persName>widow</persName> to comfort me in my old
age&#8212;The truth is that both <persName>brother </persName>and myself are too much 
unsettled as yet to trammel ourselves with a <persName>family</persName>, or one of us would
no doubt have been married before this&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mr Andrews</persName> and <persName>family </persName>and the <persName>Allys </persName>are all well and appear
very well contented&#8212;I think it probable that slavery will not be
allowed in this <placeName>country</placeName>, tho the constitution will decide it, and as
soon as I know the result I will write you&#8212;</p>

<p>We have most extraordinary crops this year corn is plenty at 25
cents, pork and Beef is also cheap and abundant, our cotton is of a
superior quality and produces very well the average highth of 
cotton on the <placeName>bottom lands</placeName> is from 9 to 12 feet and yields generally 2500
to 3000 pounds to the acre<pb n="1428"/></p>

<p>We are begining to have some little trade with <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, tho not
much as yet.</p>

<p>Kiss all the <persName>children </persName>for me and be sure and make <persName>business men</persName>
of them, learn them some occupation or profession that will support
them through life&#8212;I am not in a situation to take any of them yet,
and it is rather uncertain when I shall be</p>

<p>I have nothing very particular to write as you perceive&#8212;your 
letters must have miscarried for I have not heard from you since <date n="01-xx-1826">Jany</date>
except by report of <persName>travellers </persName>which informed me of your health&#8212;</p>

<p>Remember me to my old <persName>friend </persName><persName>Mrs John Perry</persName> and her <persName>husband</persName>
and all the <persName>Perrys </persName>and all other <persName>friends </persName>and write oftener&#8212;
your <persName>brother</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mrs. Emily M. Perry</persName> <placeName>Mine á Burton Washington
County Missouri</placeName>   <persName>Col. Matson</persName></p>
