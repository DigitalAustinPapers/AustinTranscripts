<p><persName>Col S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>My Dear Sir I have just recd yours pr<persName> D[r.] Archer</persName> and am
sorry to find the disappointment as to the Dearborn vexes you so
much&#8212;as matters have turned out it was perhaps a fortunate 
circumstance the cold winter storm for a week past would have rendered
the journey dangerous if not impracticable&#8212;<persName> She [Mrs. Holley]</persName>
recd your letter stating your intention to go to <placeName>Anahuac </placeName>and see her
on your return, before I left She therefore determine [d] to remain
at <placeName>Bolivar </placeName>until my return with my <persName>family </persName>and then if you were at
<placeName>St Felipe</placeName> to go up with me on horse back if I could not get a 
carriage&#8212;   I have now arranged for one here if wanted on my return</p>

<p>I have been detained here<date when="1831-11-22"> six days</date> by the storm, there is no
chance of the Nelson getting in until it be over&#8212; we are now 
informed that <persName>Genl Teran</persName> has returned to <placeName>Matamoras</placeName>, and conclude
you will not now leave <placeName>St Felipe</placeName> until quite well. However severe
your disappointment in not seeing <persName>Teran </persName>I think it is better than
that you should have made the journey for travelling in this bad
weather would in all probability have killed you&#8212; you have no
doubt better information as to his departure than we have If it
be true that he has removed the <persName>Garrison </persName>to <placeName>Galveston Island </placeName>and
Suspended the collection of duties till <date n="04-xx-1832">April </date>as report says I see no
reason to regret his visit or sudden departure, it gives time to observe
the moving of the waters I am told <placeName>Jalisco </placeName>and <placeName>two other states
</placeName>have withdrawn from the <placeName>union</placeName>, if so there may be a general break
up next thaw and <persName>Teran </persName>will have enough to look after at home&#8212; I
have seen your letter to <persName>John</persName>&#8212;you ought not to permit these matters
to worry you so much The <persName>bablers </persName>are mostly <persName>men of little 
influence</persName> the substantial part of the <placeName>community </placeName>are not disposed to
take any steps in public matters without your previous 
approbation&#8212;The <persName>talkers </persName>in the case of<persName> Capt Doon </persName>were mostly the <persName>shopkeepers</persName>
and <persName>whisky drinkers</persName>. I arrived here a few days after and
defended the conduct of the <persName>officer </persName>who had done no more than his<pb n="714"/>
duty and had shown more lenity than would have been shown in
such a ease in any other country</p>

<p>When the case was fairly understood all the <persName>reasonable men</persName> 
condemned <persName>Capt Doons</persName> conduct&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish much to have <persName>Mrs Holley </persName>see the <placeName>upper country</placeName> as she is
already preparing a work for publication on her return and I wish
her to have a fair opportunity to describe the <placeName>country </placeName>and to see
you long enoug[h] to get your ideas as to the representation best
calculated to make such impression on the public mind as will suit
your views of policy&#8212;</p>

<p>The affair of <persName>Hall </persName>and <persName>Phelps </persName>is like to do much mischief&#8212;
which ever way it goes if <persName>Hall </persName>gets the <placeName>land </placeName>it establishes the
principle that an individual may occupy the <placeName>property </placeName>of another
without the warrant of any public authority or judicial act which
might lead to much mischief and great disconfidence in titles generally- 
If <persName>Phelps </persName>has vitiated his title no act of <persName>Hall</persName>s can make
it good, but it strikes me as very dangerous to permit an individual
to appropriate the labor of another to himself <hi rend="italic">before any judicial
act of forfeiture is had</hi>&#8212;if permitted on one pretense now it will
soon be resorted to on another. I have already heard men speak
of denouncing <placeName>land </placeName>on the ground of forfeiture for non settlement,
having a <placeName>league </placeName>of the <persName>Hall family </persName>in view on which they say not
a tree has been cut&#8212; who can foretell the effect of such proceedings
upon the public mind here and in the <placeName>US</placeName> where the Matter will
not be understood and no doubt be much misrepresented&#8212; I am
very anxious about my <persName>family</persName>, the cold storm still continues.
The moment I get them housed I shall come to <placeName>St Felipe</placeName> and visit
the <placeName>upper country</placeName> if the weather will permit to look out a retreat
for the summer I would not keep my <persName>family </persName>at <placeName>Bolivar </placeName>through
such a Season as the last for all <placeName>Texas </placeName>it would be a certain
sacrifice of the lives of some of them-&#8212; I think somewhere near
<placeName><persName>Cole</persName>s</placeName> or <placeName><persName>Chrisman</persName>s</placeName> will from all accounts be healthiest and safest
there being a strong population there and in case I get the <persName>Swiss
families </persName>I have sent for I will place one of them there to commence
a <placeName>vineyard</placeName>&#8212; <persName>J W[e]stall</persName> has this moment come in with 
information that the Nelson is off the <placeName>Bar </placeName>and my <persName>family </persName>on shore at
<placeName><persName>Captn Chas</persName>es</placeName> all well&#8212;   It rains hard but I start at once</p>

<p><persName>H. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>My fingers and Ideas are froze up</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col S F Austin</persName>   <placeName>St Felipe de Austin</placeName></p>
