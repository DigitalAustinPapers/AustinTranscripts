<p>Dr <persName>Friend</persName>                              <placeName>Hercm</placeName>. <date when="1819-04-05">April 5, 1819</date></p>

<p>contrary to my expectations I am still in this country, tho just
on the wing, I shall commence loading my Boat <date when="1819-05-06">tomorrow </date>or next
day, and hope to start on <date when="1819-05-08">Saturday </date>or <date when="1819-05-09">Sunday morning</date>&#8212;the 150
Dollars I will send you before I stark&#8212;</p>

<p>I am in great sperits as to getting the <placeName>seat of Government at
little Rock</placeName>&#8212; you may rest assured no exertions of mine shall be
wanting, one principle thing however is an <hi rend="italic">order of Survey</hi>&#8212; I
wrote you on this Subject by <persName>R. Andrews</persName>, and wish if possible he
could be appointed the deputy&#8212; have you heard anything from
<persName>T. Rector</persName> since his return that will be interesting? have you
seen the law for <placeName>Arkansaw Territory</placeName> ? if you have any paper that
has it, please send it to me&#8212; do you know who are to be <persName>officers
in that <placeName>Territory</placeName></persName> &amp;c&#8212;</p>

<p>My <persName>Father </persName>has purchased <hi rend="italic">much </hi>Bank Stock and will be up 
immediately after my departure, the <persName>Bank </persName>held him to most <hi rend="italic">unreasonable
bail</hi>, such conduct in them is inexplicable to me. my <persName>Father </persName>and
<persName>family </persName>have been amongst the firmest supporters the Bank ever had,
and now to be ruined by its oppression I think is ungenerous, if
the money my <persName>Father </persName>owes was <hi rend="italic">all paid</hi> in at once, would it remain
in the vaults? or would it be lent out again?&#8212;it certainly would
be loaned out&#8212; if then he can make them <hi rend="italic">safe </hi>(which he has
already done) why not let the loan stand, or must <hi rend="italic">he </hi>be ruined to
satisfy some others who wish to borrow money ?&#8212; if the <persName>Directors</persName>
are governed by <hi rend="italic">that </hi>principle they need not calculate to have
<persName>Friends </persName>long of any kind, <hi rend="italic">but Shavers</hi>&#8212; one of my first objects
when I get below will be to get a <hi rend="italic">Bank </hi>under way which I have good
prospects of expecting, it then may be in our power to befriend and
aid the <persName>St Louis Bank</persName> most materially in the circulation of its notes&#8212;
if however it is to become an instrument of oppression to ruin men
without necessity&#8212;I shall wash <hi rend="italic">my </hi>hands of it, and endeavor to give
it the <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Standing </hi>in that Country which it will <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
merit My <persName>Father </persName>has nearly Stock enough to cover our debt at <hi rend="italic">Par</hi>,
which will be transfered into his name when he comes up and pledged
in addition to his mortgage if required&#8212; have you heard from
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Price</persName></hi>, or <persName>Barton</persName>, and what are the <hi rend="italic">hopes</hi>, We are <hi rend="italic">now </hi>more 
interested than ever in the fate of the <persName>Bank </persName>and what you communicate to
me shall be <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>Compliments to your <persName>Mother </persName>and <persName>Lady </persName>and believe me to be your</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. W. M. Ohara</persName> <placeName>St Louis</placeName></p>
