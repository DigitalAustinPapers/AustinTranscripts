<p>As the late regulation relative to the expenees to be paid On <placeName>Lands
in this Colony</placeName> has as I am informed caused some Animadversions
in a few persons I deem it a duty due to myself as well as to my
friends to enter into a full exposition of this subject and to give an
explanation of the Steps which I have taken since the first 
Commencement of this <placeName>Settlement</placeName>&#8212; To do this I must necessarily give
a short history of this establisht from its Origin up to the present
time&#8212;this will probably be satisfactory to all as it will more clearly
shew the efforts that I have made to secure to the <persName>settlers </persName>the Titles
to their lands, and that I have spared neither labor or expence to
complete those Titles in a way which will render them safe for ever
unless forfeited by a noncompliance on the part of the <persName>settlers </persName>with
the conditions required as to the Occupancy and improvement of the
land&#8212; I ask your candid attention to this Statement&#8212;Look at the
difficulties I have had to surmount, The risks of property, of Life,
of all, which I have exposed myself to&#8212;Consider the advantages
which you will receive from my labours, And then let your unbiassed
Judgment decide upon my Motives, And say whether I have been
right or wrong in the measures which I have adopted&#8212; It is well
known to you all that this <placeName>Settlement </placeName>was commenced uuder a 
permission granted to my Father <persName>Moses Austin</persName> by the Competent 
Authorities of the <persName>Spanish Government</persName> Anterior to the <persName>Mexican </persName>
Revolution&#8212; This permission emanated from the <persName>Deputation of the
Eastern Internal Provinces</persName> at <placeName>Monterrey </placeName>And on the <date when="1821-01-17">17th of January
1821</date> was duly approved by <persName>Joaquin Aredondo</persName> the then <persName>Commandant
General</persName> of said provinces, who Ordered the <persName>Governor of this 
Province Colonel Don Antonio Martinez</persName> to send a <persName>Commissioner </persName>to
<placeName>Nachitoches </placeName>to meet my <persName>Father </persName>and conduct him and the <persName>families</persName><pb n="812"/>
who might Accompany him into the <placeName>Province</placeName>&#8212; On the death of
my <persName>Father </persName>I proceeded to <placeName>Nachitoches </placeName>And met the said 
<persName>Commissioner </persName>who was The <persName>Honble Don Erasmo Seguin</persName> the present <persName>Deputy
in Congress</persName> from this <placeName>Province </placeName>And Accompanied him to <placeName>San 
Antonio de Bexar</placeName> where we Arrived in <date n="08-xx-1821">August 1821</date></p>

<p>On as full an investigation of the nature of the Grant to my
<persName>Father </persName>as the interpretations I received would enable me to make 1
found that the permission to introduce And settle the <persName>300 families</persName>
in this <placeName>Province </placeName>was complete And that the <persName>Governor </persName>had authority
from the <persName>Commandant Genl</persName> to designate the quantity of Land for
each <persName>family</persName>&#8212; After much Conversation with the said <persName>Governor </persName>as
to the quantity of Land And As to the place for the settlement he
by an official answer to a Letter of mine dated the <date when="1821-08-21">19th day of August
1821</date> Authorised me to promise the quantity of Land stated in
my first publication relative to this <placeName>settlement </placeName>which was 640
acres for the <persName>head of a family</persName>, 320 for his <persName>wife </persName>and 160 for each
<persName>child </persName>etc And also gave me written Authority to explore the 
<placeName>Province </placeName>and select the place for the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212; With this object I 
explored the <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName>from the <placeName>Tuscoset road</placeName> to its mouth and
thence along the <placeName>Coast </placeName>untill the <placeName>Labacca </placeName>Compelled us to bear up
to the road which we followed to the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>and explored some
distance down it and the <placeName>Brasos</placeName>&#8212; The result of this Trip was a
determination to settle on the <placeName>Brasos </placeName>And <placeName>Colorado</placeName>&#8212; And 
accordingly on my arrival at <placeName>Nachitoches </placeName>in <date n="10-xx-1821">October </date>I informed the 
<persName>Governor </persName>thereof And Also informed him that as the land which I was
to receive for myself would be no compensation for my labors and
expences in an enterprize of such magnitude I must receive some-
thing from the <persName>Settlers </persName>or I could not proceed with the Business-&#8212;
Accordingly on my arrival in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> sometime in <date n="11-xx-1821">November</date>
I published the terms of settling in this <placeName>Colony </placeName>and explicitly Stated
that those who settled under the said permission to my <persName>Father </persName>must
pay me 12 1/2 cts per Acre which would be in full for all expences of
Surveying and every thing else&#8212;- I wns particular to make these
terms as public as possible that no one might come without knowing
distinctly the Conditions of his reception&#8212; They were republished
in most of the <placeName>Western papers</placeName> And I considered it from that 
moment in the nature of an absolute contract between me and the
<persName>settlers</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I Bound myself on the one hand to procure for them a complete
Title for a certain specific quantity of Land according to the size
of their <persName>family </persName>for which they were to pay me a certain specific sum
which was to be in full for all expences of Surveying and All others
whatever they might be, And all this was done with the knowledge
of the then <persName>Governor of the <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> and besides if I had believed<pb n="813"/>
that I had no authority to make any such Contract with the <persName>settlers</persName>,
would I have laid myself liable to detection by the open frank and
public manner in which I avowed the terms of settlement; Would
I have published them in the <placeName>Newspapers </placeName>when I very well knew
that those papers were sent to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, to <placeName>Monterrey</placeName>, to <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>
and to an-hundred other places where the <persName>Government </persName>would see
or hear of them&#8212; Or would I myself have sent the paper which
contained the terms to the <persName>Governor of this <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> which I did in
<date n="11-xx-1821">Novr 1821</date> immediately after it was issued&#8212; Let me ask you as
candid men does this look like an intention on my part to deceive or
to do an act which I thought was not Authorised to&#8212; Put 
yourselves in my situation and look at the vast burthen of responsibility
which has Oppressed me like a deadly weight ever since I engaged
in this enterprize&#8212; An interprize which originated in the active
mind and indefatigable perseverance of my much honored and
lamented <persName>father </persName>who sacrificed his life by the too Ardent pursuit of
an object which it was always evident would result more to the
credit of the projectors enterprize and perseverance than to his
profit And in which the advantages secured to the <persName>settler </persName>and the
benefits accruing to this <placeName>Province </placeName>and <persName>Government </persName>would bear no
just proportion to the Compensation which was expected or asked&#8212;
for let it be remembered that at that time this <placeName>Province </placeName>with the
exception of <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> and <placeName>La Bahia</placeName> was a desart, that it was
interdicted to the <persName>American Settler</persName> who but a short time before had
been driven from it with fire and Sword; And untill this permission
was obtained by my <persName>Father</persName>, those who emigrated here did so as it
were by stealth and without any other security for their property
or lives than the Caprice of the <persName>Commandants </persName>who Governed, for
their Emigration was not sanctioned by the <persName>Superior Government</persName>&#8212;
Consider the difficulties which my <persName>Father </persName>must have had to 
Surmount, to obtain a permission which could never before be got by
any person&#8212; Consider that on his death I assumed upon myself
the responsibility not only of Securing to the <persName>Settler</persName>s Complete titles
to their lands, but Also of being personally responsible to the 
<persName>Government </persName>for their good conduct&#8212; and look at the labors and 
probable expences which such An enterprize was Calculated to cost, and
Ask yourselves whether any of you would in <date n="xx-xx-1821">1821</date> have taken upon
you the weight of responsibility which I then did? Whether you
would have jeopardized your property, hazarded your health, your
lives, Your all to make the fortunes of others and been Content to do
so without the hope of any greater Compensation than you could
give to an individual who joined you as a settler and who would
have no responsibility labour or expence to encounter more than
the care of his own <persName>family</persName>&#8212;   Would you have been content I ask<pb n="814"/>
to do it; or would it have been just that you should have done
so ? If not can you blame me for making the public declaration in
the beginning of this <placeName>Settlement </placeName>that the <persName>Settlers </persName>must aid me by
paying a specific sum for the benefits I secured to them; And was
there then any thing unjust or improper in such an arrangement in
its Origin ? &#8212;If not let us proceed to examine whether any thing
Occurred in the progress of the business which rendered an 
adherence to the Original terms of the Contract with the <persName>Settlers </persName>
improper&#8212;</p>

<p>When in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> in <date n="11-xx-1821">November </date>I dispatched a Vessel with
Men and provisions and tools for the <placeName>settlement </placeName>and proceeded on
by land myself to meet her at the <placeName>Mouth of the Colorado</placeName>&#8212;After a
three months trip wandering in the swamps and thickets of these
Rivers and in waiting at the <placeName>mouth of the Colorado</placeName> for said Vessel
I gave her up for lost and in <date n="03-xx-1822">March </date>proceeded to <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> to
inform the <persName>Governor </persName>that I had Commenced the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>and to
request him to send with me a <persName>Commr </persName>to superintend the partition of
the land Agreeably to the Arrangement made with him in August
previous&#8212;On my Arrival I was informed by the <persName>Govr </persName>that in
Consequence of the revolution and change of <persName>Governmt </persName>he felt 
unwilling to do anything in the business, that he was an <persName>European </persName>and
did not know at what monent he might be removed from office or
how the revolution would terminate, in consequence of which he
had determined not to transact any public business except Such as
could not be postponed&#8212;he Assured me that the <persName>Settlers </persName>would
be safe and that the permission granted to my <persName>Father </persName>would always
be respected by the <persName>Government</persName>, but that great delay might arise
before they could be legally put in possession of their lands and
receive titles therefor&#8212;this information was as unexpected as it
was mortifying to me&#8212;I felt myself bound in honor to Comply
fully with my part of the Contract with the <persName>Settlers </persName>and to procure
Complete titles for them to their lands&#8212;this was a new and 
unexpected difficulty which was never Anticipated or even dreamt of by
me&#8212;I applied to the <persName>Governor </persName>for advice informing him that I
had rather die than not effect what I had promised to the <persName>Settlers</persName>
and that without so much delay as he Anticipated&#8212;He advised me
to go to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and apply to <persName>Congress</persName>&#8212;One nights deliberation
determined me to accept of this advice and on the <date when="1822-03-15">15 day of March
1822</date> I departed for the <placeName>City of Mexico</placeName>&#8212;It is needless for me to
detail the difficulty I had in procuring funds for this unexpected trip,
or the immense sacrifices I was compelled to make of the little 
property I had saved from the wreck of my broken fortunes in the <placeName>U
States</placeName>, besides which I had to dispose of one half of the lands which
I might obtain before I could raise the means of progressing with<pb n="815"/>
the enterprize&#8212;Suffice it to say that I raised the means at all costs,
for success was now no longer Considered by me so much a matter
of Speculation as a point of honor to redeem my pledged word to
the <persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212;I therefore disregarded my own Interest which the then
prospects justified the belief would have been more promoted by an
abandmonment than a further prosecution of the enterprize&#8212;I 
arrived in the <placeName>City of Mexico</placeName> in <date n="34-xx-1822">April </date>without <persName>Acquantances</persName>, without
<persName>friends</persName>,&#8212;A <persName>Stranger </persName>in a City where untill very recently, <persName>foreigners</persName>
were prescribed by the Laws and Discountenanced by the people from
prejudice&#8212;Ignorant of the Language, of the Laws, the forms, the
dispositions, and feeling of the Government, with barely the means
of paying my Expences for a few months, and in fact I may say
destitute of almost every thing necessary to insure success in such a
Mission as I had undertaken, but the integrity of my intentions&#8212;
Added to all this I found the <placeName>City </placeName>in an unsettled State, the whole
people and <placeName>Country </placeName>still Agitated by the revolutionary Convulsion
which had just terminated in their emancipation, public Opinion 
Vacillating as to the form of Government which ought to be adopted&#8212;
Party spirit raging with that Acrimony which political Collision
is Calculated to excite And the recently established <persName>Governmt </persName>almost
sinking under its efforts to preserve the public peace and Order&#8212;In
this unfavourable State of things and Surrounded on every side by
difficulties I entered upon the Objects of my Mission, formed 
<persName>Acquaintances </persName>with the <persName>members of Congress</persName>, the <persName>Officers of Governmt</persName> and
<persName>Men of influence</persName> And by the <date when="1822-05-12">12th of May</date> had my business in a
favourable train before the <persName>Regency </persName>which then Composed the 
<persName>Supreme Executive power of the Nation</persName>&#8212;And my Memorial was also
before <persName>Congress </persName>and probably would soon have been acted on&#8212;But
on the night of the <date when="1822-05-18">18th of May</date> a new flame burst from the 
revolutionary crater whose fires it seemed had only subsided for a time
but were not extinguished.</p>

<p>The <persName>provisional Government</persName> was Overturned, And the <persName>Army </persName>in
the City usurping the Voice of the Nation proclaimed the <persName>Emperor</persName>
and enforced his election by <persName>Congress </persName>at the point of the Bayonet&#8212;
It is easy to imagine the Commotion which an event of such
magnitude was calculated to produce&#8212;fear silenced every tongue,
but the sullen gloom that hung round the Old and best tried <persName>patriots
of the revolution</persName> portended the Storm that was only Smothered
for a time that it might burst with greater effect upon those who
had usurped the Nations rights by the forcible establishment of a
system of Government which was evidently in Opposition to the
will of the majority of the people&#8212;The newly established 
Government foresaw the impending Storm And all their Attention was
devoted to such Measures as they thought likely to Avert it&#8212;Repub-<pb n="816"/>
licanism was proscribed as a Crime and <persName>Republicans </persName>persecuted
as Criminals, heavy restrictions were laid on <persName>foreigners </persName>by decrees
regulating the manner and conditions in which they were to enter
the Country&#8212;they were suspected and watched&#8212;in fact the whole
Attention of the <persName>New Imperial Government</persName> was directed to their
own Consolidation and preservation&#8212;In this state of things 
individual applications were lost amidst the multiplicity of more 
important and I may say of personal Interests which occupied the
<persName>Executive Department</persName>&#8212;And my Application Coming as it did
from a <persName>foreigner </persName>born and bred a republican and whose Object
was to form a <placeName>Colony </placeName>within the new <placeName>Empire </placeName>of Men who like
himself were Also born and bred in that land of liberty where 
Imperial Diadems were only estimated by the intrinsic value of the
materials which Composed them and where no Sceptre ruled but
the public will, was considered by my friends as a hopeless Object,
And I was Advised to save myself from further pecuniary ruin
and embarrassment by its Abandonment&#8212;-My Answer to this was,
that my faith was pledged to the <persName>Settlers </persName>to secure their titles, and
that I never would abandon their Interests&#8212;that the public 
Contract made with them to secure their lands should be complied with
on my part of such a thing was possible&#8212;Accordingly I presevered
through one whole year of Revolution and political Convulsions in
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>, And After the <persName>Congress </persName>was dispersed by the <persName>Emperor </persName>On
the <date when="1822-10-31">31 of October</date>&#8212;the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Junta Nacional Instituyente</persName></hi> which was 
substituted in its stead passed the Colonization Law which was finally
Approved by the <persName>Emperor </persName>and published on the <date when="1823-01-04">4th day of January
1823</date>&#8212;-I can without boasting say that my Constant Exertions and
importunity with the <persName>Members </persName>both directly and indirectly through
my <persName>friends </persName>produced this Law, for if it had been delayed a few
weeks longer the new revolutionary events of <date n="01-xx-1823">January </date>and 
<date n="02-xx-1823">February </date>would have prevented its passage at all during that year&#8212;
Immediately After the promulgation of the Colonization Law I
urged a decision of my busineas by the <persName>Government</persName>, And After
passing through the hands of the <persName>Captain General of the Internal
Provinces Don Anastacio Bustamente</persName> and the <persName>Council of State</persName>
who made separate reports on it&#8212;The <persName>Imperor </persName>on the <date when="1823-02-18">18 of february
1823</date> issued the Decree Authorising me to complete the <placeName>Colony </placeName>and
regulating the quantity of Lands to be distributed to the <persName>Settlers </persName>in
Conformity with the Colonization Law, a translation of which
Decree accompanies this Statement&#8212;marked A.&#8212;As Soon as I
received this decree of the <persName>Emperor </persName>I considered my business finished
and prepared to leave <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, but the Storm which the forcible
proclamation of the <persName>Emperor </persName>had engendered now burst forth from
every quarter and threatened to speedy Subversion of a throne which<pb n="817"/>
had been reared in opposition to the public will&#8212;New difficulties
now presented themselves which I doubted might possibly at some
period involve the Interests of the <persName>Settlers </persName>for whom I had been so
long labouring&#8212;It was an Avowed principle with the <persName>new 
revolutionists</persName> who had raised the Republican flag in opposition to the
Imperial that the <persName>Emperor </persName>was an <persName>Usurper</persName>, that the Legislative
Body created by him and called the <persName>Junta Nacional Instituyente
</persName>who passed the Colonization Law was illegally Constituted And that
all the Acts of the <persName>Imperial Government</persName> were void not even 
excepting those which were Sanctioned by <persName>Congress </persName>before its dispersion
for it was Contended that, that body acted from Coercion and not
with the liberty of a deliberative Assembly of the peoples 
representatives&#8212;How far this principle would be recognized by the new
Government that was to succeed the Imperial was problematical
And as I had Spent so much time and money I determined to await
the issue of the then pending revolution And if necessary apply to
the <persName>new Govt.</persName> for a Confirmation of the Grant which I had received
from the <persName>Emperor</persName>&#8212;Accordingly I waited untill the dethronement
of the <persName>Emperor </persName>the <date when="1823-03-31">last of March</date> and the final reestablishment of
the Congress, And then to remove All doubts which might Arise as
to the Competency of the Authority that gave me the <placeName>Grant </placeName>I 
presented a petition to <persName>Congress </persName>praying them to Confirm the said
Grant which was acted on the <date when="1823-04-10">10 of April</date> and passed to the <persName>Supreme
Executive power</persName> who were Authorized to confirm it if they thought
proper, And on the <date when="1824-04-14">14 of April</date> they did by their Decree Confirm
it, As will Appear by translations of the Said Decrees of <persName>Congress</persName>
and of the Executive power which also Accompanies this Statement
Marked B  and C&#8212;</p>

<p>My Business was now finished by the highest Authority known
to this or any other <placeName>Nation </placeName>that is governed by the representative
System to wit the <persName>Sovereign Congress</persName> of the people in the free and
legal exercise of their functions. And I left <placeName>Mexico </placeName>on the <date when="1824-04-18">18 of
April </date>wanting only 10 days to be One year from my Arrival in it
on this Mission&#8212;I took the precaution to have Copies of the 
documents relative to this <placeName>Colony </placeName>passed through the hands of the 
<persName>Commandant General of the <placeName>Eastern Internal provinces</placeName></persName>  at <placeName>Monterrey</placeName>
And Also to have them sent direct to the <persName>Government of this
<placeName>Province</placeName></persName> that records of them might remain in the <placeName>Archives </placeName>of
each As well as in the <placeName><persName>Secretary of State</persName>s Office in Mexico</placeName> to multiply
the chances of their preservation in case Accident should ever destroy
the records of either of those <placeName>Offices</placeName>.</p>

<p>I now hurried towards <placeName>Texas </placeName>to meet the <persName>settlers </persName>and inform
them of their safety and the happy result of my Mission, relieved
from the Oppressive burthen which had Come upon my mind for<pb n="818"/>
such a length of time&#8212;Owing to sundry delays in <placeName>Monterrey </placeName>which
I could not very well avoid and which were caused by my Anxiety
to perfect the work I had so far progressed with I did not arrive
in <placeName>San Antonio de Bexar</placeName> until <date n="07-xx-1823">July </date>in Company with the new
<persName>Governor Luciano Garcia</persName> who was appointed to succeed 
<persName>Trespalacios</persName>&#8212;You will perceive by the decree of the <persName>Emperor </persName>that the lands
were to be laid off for the <persName>Settlers </persName>and Titles given therefor by
myself in Conjunction with the <persName>Governor of this Province</persName> or a
<persName>Commissioner </persName>whom he should name&#8212;-The <persName>Governor </persName>appointed the
<persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName> this <persName>Comr</persName>. and we arrived in Company on the
<placeName>Colorado </placeName>in <date n="08-xx-1823">August</date>&#8212;On my arrival the <persName>Settlers </persName>were publicly
notified and informed of the manner in which they were to procure
their lands both by the <persName>Comr</persName>. and myself. And I was very particular
to inform them all and in the most public manner that the terms
originally established by me relative to the cost of their lands must
be adhered to&#8212;The first Object After my return was to get the
Land Surveyed, an object of equally as much importance as the
Titles themselves and one which was embraced in my original 
Contract with the <persName>Settlers</persName>, for I was bound not only to procure titles
for their Lands but also to survey them and pay all other Expences
whatever attending the completion of their Titles An Obligation
which was binding on me for ever, unless released therefrom by a
noncompliance on the part of the <persName>Settlers </persName>with their part of the said
Contract&#8212;Before I arrived in the <placeName>Colony </placeName>after my return from
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>I studied the whole subject with all the attention which my
feeble capacity would allow me to devote to one of such importance
to the <persName>settlers </persName>as well as to the <persName>Government </persName>whose interests it was
also our duty to promote.</p>

<p>Two plans presented themselves for Completing the <placeName>settlement</placeName>-
One was to let each <persName>Settler </persName>run his lines as he pleased, and mark
them or not, or define his Tract by natural or imaginary boundaries
and make out the Deeds accordingly&#8212;And only requiring them to
pay the Expenses which were due to the Government but by adopting
this plan I should as I considered have forfeited my part of the
Original Contract with the <persName>Settlers </persName>which was to survey and clear
out their lands as well as to procure Titles for them, A Contract
which I thought I had no right to change, besides I had seen and
we have all seen or heard of the difficulties and confusion which
arose and still exists in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName>Tennessee </placeName>And many other States
in consequence of locations being made without actual Surveys, tracts
or parts of tracts, when run out were found to interfere with each
other and hence arose a source of litigation which has involved
hundreds and I may say thousands in the perplexing mazes and
hopeless uncertainties of law Suits which after harrassing a <persName>family</persName><pb n="819"/>
for years and like a Moth devouring its substance finally involved
them in ruin and beggary&#8212;</p>

<p>To Comply therefore with my part of the Contract with the
<persName>Settlers </persName>in full And at the same time to save them from even the
possibility of difficulty hereafter relative to their lines I determined
to survey the Lands regularly and accurately and to continue upon
myself the responsibility which my original Contract with the
<persName>Settlers </persName>imposed on me of being personally responsible for the 
expence of Surveying, for the Expences due to the Governmt and
for all other Expences whatever; expecting that the settlers would
comply with their part of the Contract by paying the sum originally
stipulated&#8212;There were also other considerations which urged the
Adoption or rather the continuance of this plan&#8212;The fees due to
the <persName>Governmt </persName>would have to be paid in Cash&#8212;The Expenses of
Surveying if any was done would Also have been burthensome in
many instances to the <persName>Settlers </persName>to advance, besides the first <persName>Settlers</persName>
who had borne all the difficulties of establishing the Country would
have then been placed on an Equality with those who came later
after all the difficulties were over, provisions were plenty, and the
<persName>Indians </persName>forced into subjection&#8212;Whereas the plan which I adopted
relative to the payments would have removed all these difficulties
and enabled the first <persName>Settlers </persName>to reap the full fruits of their Arduous
labors to the extent they merited, and that without the delay which
a different plan would likely have produced. I informed the
<persName>Settlers </persName>on my arrival that I would receive any kind of property
from them, And give them their own time to pay it in, at the same
time requesting those who were able to do so to aid me all they
could, for that I had so far faithfully Complied with my part of
the Contract with them And thought that in justice they ought to
do the same towards me&#8212;I never said that any one ought to pay
one Cent before he received his Title&#8212;The new <persName>Settlers </persName>who came in
and who had no privations to undergo in Comparison to the first
<persName>Settlers </persName>I did say ought to make more prompt payment And in this
Arrangement I consulted the Interests of the old <persName>settlers</persName>, for the
sums I should have thus received would have enabled me to have
paid a part of the surveying fees, And Governing on the Lands
of the Old <persName>Settlers </persName>without harrassing them to raise the Money &#8212;
from those who did not pay money or some other property that could
be used I intended to have taken notes payable in Cotton in yearly
installments, of One two or Six years according to the situatn of
the person&#8212;This would not have been oppressive for every one
could have paid two or three hundred pounds of Cotton annually
without ever feeling it&#8212;these notes would have insured a certainty
of receiving a specific quantity of Cotton annually And this cer-<pb n="820"/>
tainly would have given me credit with some <persName>Merchant </persName>in <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> to advance me <placeName>Cotton Gins</placeName> and a Vessel, to prepare and
transport to market this as well as all other Cotton made in the
Country, and thus in One year the Cotton trade would have been
in full Operation which is the principal thing that is to raise us
from poverty&#8212;Besides Another branch of my plan was to hire as
many <persName>workmen </persName>As I could to build <placeName>Mills</placeName> <placeName>Cotton Gins</placeName> And Any other
Improvements that would have advanced the Country and thus
enable those who did not wish to clear their farms immediately and
raise Cotton to pay for their land in that way&#8212;-And in furtherance
of this plan I have already Commenced a <placeName>Mill </placeName>on the <placeName>Creek above
Town</placeName>&#8212;The Operation of this plan would have been to save the
Old <persName>Settlers </persName>from being harrassed in any way relative to their lands,
for a portion of that part of the Expences which they would have
been Compelled to advance under a different System would have
been paid by the New <persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212;The Land would have all been 
accurately and regularly run off whereby difficulties both immediate
and remote would have been avoided&#8212;The Cotton Trade would have
been established at once The Country would have been improved
by <persName>Mills </persName>and Machinery without delay, And by these means would
have advanced more during the next year than under a different
System it probably could have done in four or five&#8212;</p>

<p>It has been objected to this that I am making an immense 
fortune&#8212; A great Speculation out of the <persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212; Let us examine 
Carefully this subject by the application of Arithmetical calculation
to it and see what appears to be the result&#8212; The Surveying 
Averaging One League with Another and taking the <placeName>bends of the Rivers</placeName>
and <placeName>Oblong Leagues</placeName> will cost about $70 per League which for 300
wrould be $21,000&#8212; The Taxes due to the Government independent of
the Surveying as fixed by the late regulation is $165.4 Cash on each
League which for 300 [is] $49,600.4 making together the sum of
$70.600.4 to which I made myself personally responsible for and
$49.600.4 of that in Cash to the Government, And for the Whole
of which Sum I might have been called on for in one year&#8212; To
raise this sum I should have had claims on the Settlers for $555 per
League which for 300 would have made $166,500 payable in 
property at a distant period and in small installments and that property
received at double or treble what it would actually bring in Cash&#8212;
for I appeal to you all to say whether I would now get either here
or any where else 40, 50 or <hi rend="italic">60 Dlls</hi> for horses which I have received at
$100. 120 and 150 Dlls and all other property in the Same 
proportion&#8212; Independent of this Calculate the risk I run in transporting
this property to Market and converting it into Money&#8212; the 
probability of being Compelled to force Sales at any Sacrifice to raise<pb n="821"/>
Money to pay the <persName>Surveyors </persName>and Government fees&#8212; the time, Cost,
and labor expended in the business and the pecuniary responsibility
imposed on me by it&#8212; Then add to this the labor and expence 
incurred by my <persName>Father </persName>to obtain the original permission, his health
destroyed and Life sacrificed&#8212; Also the three years perplexing and
fatiguing Labors which I have undergone and the Money expended
to perfect the Grant, And to all this Add the vast burthen of 
responsibility which rests upon me, to be Accountable for the good Conduct
of the <persName>Settlers</persName>, And the perplexing task of administering the <persName>Civil
Government of the Colony</persName>, And then Ask yourselves whether you
would not rather take your Single League of Land in peace than to
receive what I am entitled to together with the 12 1/2 cts an acre And
be involved in the Labyrinth of trouble and Vexation and 
responsibility that I am&#8212; As regards the equivalent which you were to
receive for this 12 1/2 cts an Acre, <hi rend="italic">was it not worth it?</hi> And if you
could not have obtained it any other way would you have been
unwilling to pay that Sum for it? And could you or would vou ever
have obtained it unless through my exertions? I Have been thus
lengthy in this exposition because I deemed it my duty to explain
to you fully every step I had taken or intended to take in the 
Business&#8212; You now can form your own Opinion relative to the merits
or demerits of my exertions And particularly whether I ought in
justice to be charged with illegally and unjustly speculating on
the <persName>Settlers </persName>as I am told I have been by a few, And whether the
Conditions made public by me in the beginning of the <placeName>settlement</placeName>
was not in fact a proposal for a fair And specific Contract in which
I was one Party And All who applied to me for a settlement in this
<placeName>Colony </placeName>formed the other party ? And whether every honorable man
ought not to feel himself in Equity bound to that Contract, even
if the <persName>Government of this Province</persName> declared otherwise&#8212; It is a well
acknowledged rule that a Man's labor merits reward in proportion to
the benefits derived from it, and also that the value of an Article
is prized in proportion to the difficulty of obtaining it&#8212; Apply
this rule to the present case&#8212; When my <persName>Father </persName>obtained the 
permission for this <placeName>Settlement </placeName>no other person had ever been able 
before that time to procure such a privilege, And Altho hundreds of
applications have been made, no one has ever obtained it since,
And the <persName>families </persName>who have settled in different parts of the <placeName>Province</placeName>
out of this <placeName>Colony </placeName>are at the entire mercy of the <persName>Government </persName>
without the least Security whatever that they will ever get land or even
be permitted to rem[ai]n in the peaceable possession of the places
they have chosen,&#8212; the privilege therefore procured by my <persName>Father</persName>
and perfected by me was difficult to get for no one had ever succeeded
in getting it before him, nor since. And it has cost the life of my<pb n="822"/>
<persName>Father</persName>, More than three years of my labour, A Trip to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, And
immense expence, All which was at my own individual risk If 
therefore the above rule can be applied to this case, that an Article is
prized in proportion to the difficulty of obtaining it. Surely the
privileges I have obtained for the <persName>settlers of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> ought to
be prized highly&#8212; And Also if my labors are to be valued in 
proportion to the benefits which the <persName>Settlers </persName>receive from them, they are
worth Something, that is if it is considered that a League of Land
here is of any value&#8212; I therefore cannot help considering that the
Contract Originally made between me and the <persName>settlers </persName>in justice is
and ought to be obligatory on both parties And Whether the 
<persName>Governor of this <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> can properly interfere in my private Contracts,
And release the <persName>Settlers </persName>from all legal obligation to comply with
them, is a question Which I shall not enter upon&#8212; If however you
admit the principle and say that he can interfere in one private
Contract And dissolve it why may he not with equal justice do the
same in all? Where is the stopping place? Where is the Security
for any man who Contracts to do a certain Specific thing for a fixed
sum, if the Contract can be dissolved in this manner?</p>

<p>It might however be observed that if the <persName>Settlers </persName>Consider the
Original Contract dissolved on their parts why have not I the same
privilege to consider myself also free from all Obligation to procure
titles for their lands! and say to those who refuse to Comply with
the Original terms stipulated with them&#8212;Attend to your business-
Go elsewhere to procure your Titles&#8212;I will have nothing more to
do with the Business&#8212;A thing which I might in justice do, if the
Original Contract was disregarded, And which I certainly would do
were I to be governed solely by motives of self interest&#8212;for it must
be evident to you all that if I receive nothing from the <persName>settlers </persName>a
further prosecution of the object would only involve me still more
in pecuniary difficulty and ruin&#8212;for I am to get 22 1/2 Leagues of
Land half of which was disposed of in the beginning to raise funds
to enable me to effect the object as I before stated which leaves 11 1/4
Leagues to my share&#8212;Now suppose that these 11 1/4 Leagues were sold
at this time to raise money to replace what I have expended in the
Business And to pay the debts I have been obliged to contract with
<persName>Surveyors </persName>and others would it not still leave me in debt to say
nothing of my time And labour for more than 3 years past&#8212;
Whatever may be the determination of the <persName>Settlers </persName>in this point I hope
they will do me the justice to take a full end impartial view of the
whole subject and not be too ready to condemn me as a <persName>speculator</persName>
on the poor, a charge which I am told a few discontented Men have
made against me And One which I think is unmeritted And which
I do hope the reflecting And sound part of the <placeName>Colony </placeName>will pro-<pb n="828"/>
nounce to be unjust-for my plan so far from Oppressing the poor
was Calculated And intended to relieve them&#8212;I also wished to do
justice to myself and <persName>family </persName>which it was my duty to do&#8212;</p>

<p>It is well Known to you all that I have contracted to pay $5 per
Mile for the surveying that is Already done And that by the late
regulation I am only allowed $27 per League Now let any candid
man say whether it would be just for me to suffer this loss, a loss
which would be incurred by me solely for the individual benefit of
the <persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212;As regards the future surveys much difficulty presents
itself, unless my first plan is still continued, for it will be difficult to
procure <persName>surveyors </persName>at $27 per League and I am induced to believe 
impossible to procure them&#8212;The <persName>Settlers </persName>must therefore be content
with imperfect Surveys of their land or aid the <persName>surveyors </persName>in 
carrying the chain marking etc.&#8212;Another difficulty is that unless the land
is regularly run off, so as to join where the nature of the situation
will admit of some Confusion may Arise in making locations and
the Settlement of a <persName>neighbourhood </persName>be greatly disarranged which
might have been Compact, for the <persName>Governor </persName>has ordered that 
hereafter no sitio tracts can be run in any other way than in full Leagues
&#8212;So that if locations are made so as to leave fractions of 1/4 or 1/2 etc
etc of a League between them, those fractions could not be occupied
at all untill the public lands were generally disposed of&#8212;I wish to
make one observation as regards the Surveys generally&#8212;Many of
you say that you came here to procure Land for your <persName>children</persName>, if so
ought you to get that Land for them in a way that even by possibility
might involve them in lawsuits hereafter relative to their lines?
And if the surveys are not regularly and fully Completed and
marked will it be possible to avoid interference and consequent
future litigation and perhaps ruin to yourselves or to your <persName>heirs</persName>, and
is it not better that you should have your land surveyed in full even
at any reasonable cost than to locate at random&#8212;</p>

<p>I will now make a few observations relative to the <persName>Civil Government
of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> And then Close this Statement&#8212;The responsibility of
the public Order and Administration of justice in this <placeName>Colony </placeName>was
imposed upon me by the Superior Government as you see by the
Decree of the <placeName>Emperor</placeName>&#8212;This charge is however only provisional as
I have always informed you untill the <placeName>Colony </placeName>is filled up And you
have the members to appoint your <persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>or representative
bodies&#8212;The legal jurisdiction of each of these <persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>As
the <persName>Governor </persName>informs me is five Leagues square when the 
population Admits of that division&#8212;these divisions are called <placeName>partidos </placeName>or
<placeName>prescincts </placeName>And also elect their <persName>Alcaldes</persName>&#8212;A number of these 
prescincts forms a district, And the <persName>Ayuntamiento of the Capital of
the <placeName>District</placeName></persName> has in some respects a kind of superintendance in a few
things over the others, And there is Also appointed a <persName>Judge </persName>for each<pb n="824"/>
of said <placeName>Districts </placeName>called in Spanish a <persName>Juez de letras</persName> or <persName>Judge of 
Learning</persName>&#8212;In this way this <placeName>Colony </placeName>will be organized as soon as it can be
done&#8212;I wished the <persName>Governor </persName>to do it when here, but he thought it
too soon And promised to do it in the fall I am particularly Anxious
to see this arrangement Completed for it will release me from the
disagreeable task now imposed upon me and will probably be much
more satisfactory to the people as then they will be governed by Men
elected by themselves, for these <persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>are a species of Select
Men or <persName>Council </persName>elected Annually by the people of the <placeName>prescinct</placeName>, And
the <persName>Alcaldes </persName>are also elected in the same way</p>

<p>The office I now hold was never sought for by me from choice or
inclinotion but it must have been filled by some one untill the <placeName>Colony</placeName>
was organized and I thought it would promote the general interests
of us all much more to take it myself than to run the risk of haviug
an officer sent here who knew nothing of our language customs or
dispositions&#8212;I have never sought after appointments And never shall
but I deem it the duty of every one to serve his Country when called
on to do it so far as his Capacity will admit&#8212;</p>

<p><date when="1824-06-05">June 5: 1824</date>.</p>

<p>Your fellow Citizen</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName> in his memorial to the <persName>Mexican Government</persName>
first stated the quantity of land he had promised to the <persName>settlers </persName>under
the arrangement with <persName>Govr. Martinez</persName> And prayed the Govt to confirm
that quantity to them or designate the quantity they were to have
And also that certain fixed limits should be established for the
<placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;2ndly- He prayed that the mode of making out the titles and
delivering them to the <persName>Settlers </persName>should be fixed&#8212;3dly He asked for
permission to settle as many <persName>families </persName>in the limits which he prayed
for as the land in those limits would permit. 4thly He required to
know the quantity of land that wd be allowed to him for his own
use. 5thly- He asked for Authority to found a <placeName>Town</placeName>-&#8212;6&#8212;He asked
the Govt to designate the manner in which the Civil Govt of the
<placeName>Colony </placeName>should be administered in its commencement and untill it was
completed&#8212;</p>

<p>This Meml was presented 9 months before the passage of the 
Colonization Law and was referred to the Council of State who made a
lengthy report thereon after the said law was published, a copy of
which report also accompanies the decree of the <persName>Emperor </persName>and upon
that report was founded the following Decree of the <persName>Emperor</persName>.</p>
