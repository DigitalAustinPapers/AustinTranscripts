<p>My Dear Sir&#8212;</p>

<p>I have at last safely arrived with my <persName>family</persName>, after an unpleasant
and tedious passage. I am a good deal occupied endeavouring to
fix up some place to go in; and unfortunately am deprived of <persName>Mrs
Fisher</persName>'s management, in consequence of a fall she received a day
or two Since. Could I possibly have left my <persName>family </persName>I would have
gone up to See you as I am very anxious to have a conversation
with you. Since my arrival I have learned that our friend 
<persName>Lessassier </persName>has abandoned the practice of the Law, and turned <persName>teacher</persName>.
Now <persName>school masters</persName> are generally needy, and I hope I may not
experience delay or diffueulty in settling my business with him; he
must have collected a considerable sum on my account, and I am
already suffering for the means of Settling for my freight and
passage. I wrote to him to have it in readiness for me at <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>,
and perhaps he may have, but as my letters were directed to <placeName>San
Felipe </placeName>the chances are he has not received them. I write you in
confidence that you may advise me. be good enough to write me
when you expect to go to <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, and when you will return, 
enclosed is a letter from our friend <persName>Learning</persName>. Present me to<persName> Mr.
Williams</persName> and <persName>family </persName>and to my <persName>padrino</persName></p>

<p><persName>S Rhoads Fisher</persName></p>

<p><persName>Col. S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Enclosed is a letter to<persName> Mr. Lesassier </persName>which you will please deliver
to him, as it contains a request to send me immediately $300 by <persName>Mr
Jaques</persName>, who will return the day after he reaches <placeName>town</placeName>. Your 
suggestion to him of the inconvenience I am put to may probably
stimulate him to send it. <persName>Judge Cummins</persName> has received a good deal
of money belonging to me, but has spent it, and says he cannot pay
me a dollar, this to say the least is ungenerous, as I paid for him
to the <persName>Sheriff </persName>last year between 2 and 300 drs.</p>

<p><persName>S. R. F</persName></p>
