<p><persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir Previous to your deceased <persName>father</persName>'s visit to the 
<placeName>province of Texas</placeName>&#8212;I advanced him some funds&#8212;which on his return to
this <placeName>State </placeName>acknowledged&#8212;that is was partly through my 
befrending him in this instance, he was enabled to procure the greater part
of his <placeName>Grant</placeName>&#8212;which has since been confirmed to you&#8212;on his return
I made him still farther advances, and supplys for his <persName>family</persName>&#8212;the
sum total of the advances I made him&#8212;amounts to Two hundred
and sixty nine dollars and Ten cents for which sum, on his last visits
to this <placeName>place</placeName>, he executed to me his note, at Eighteen months after
date, say <date when="1821-04-14">April 14th 1821</date>&#8212;and made said note payable with interest,<pb n="1334"/>
in the <placeName>City of New Orleans</placeName>&#8212;It was solely at his request that the
Note was made payable at so distant a period&#8212;and after unfolding
to me his reasons&#8212;which were, that having obtained the <placeName>grant</placeName>, he
would if his life was sparred, be enabled by that time, to get many
<persName>settlers </persName>on the tract&#8212;and without doubt, would be enabled to settle
the same. He also made me handsome overtures to take a [part]
of the <placeName>grant </placeName>with him&#8212;but my business at that time being so 
extensive, I could not otherways do, than to decline his proposition-
Since that time, partly inconsequence of the change in the course of
trade&#8212;and having a large amount creditted out&#8212;the greater part of
which is Totally lost forever&#8212;and having to meet my own 
engagements&#8212;my situation became truly allarming to such a degree&#8212;(that
without being compelled to take the benifit of the insolvent laws)
I stripped myself of everything&#8212;and now am a[s] poor as a <persName>beggar</persName>&#8212;
not in any kind of business&#8212;not a dollar to my name, and supporting
myself, barely, by doing jobs of writing etc., for others&#8212;since my
situation has been such&#8212;One <persName>freind </persName>has loaned me, whenever he had
&#8212;and I am indebted to him&#8212;borrowed money, which he stands in
great need off&#8212;</p>

<p>I have been induced from my own personal acquaintance with
you, and from observations made by several of your <persName>freinds</persName>&#8212;to
apply to you&#8212;to discharge the note&#8212;and I do feel the most 
confident assurance that after taken all the circumstances in view, I
shall not be disappointed in my expectations&#8212;you are now the 
<persName>possessor of a grant</persName>, that was formally given to your <persName>Father</persName>&#8212;who
stated to me previous to his death, that it was pretty much through
my intrementality, that he obtained the <placeName>grant</placeName>&#8212;I am well apprized
that in consequence of the different changes of Government which
have taken place in the <placeName>republic of New Mexico</placeName>, since your <persName>father</persName>
visit to that place, that you must have had, a tedious and irksome
undertaking to have got the <placeName>grant </placeName>fully settled this your <persName>freinds</persName>
have told me is the present case, and, say that you have obtained an
additional one, adjoining&#8212;My dear Sir, you have my best wishes for
you[r] success and prosperity&#8212;and had I been in possession of the
means, I would have visited your <placeName>colony </placeName>before this&#8212;For Heavens
sake let me hear from you as early after the receipt of this, as may
be convenient&#8212;and I conclude, by trusting with the flattering hope
that you will communicate to me the pleasing information that&#8212;This
debt of your <persName>father</persName>s will be discharged by his <persName>son</persName>&#8212;since whose death.
I have taken no step towards its liquidation&#8212;</p>

<p>Expecting to have the pleasure of hearing from you&#8212;I am dear
Sir. your poverty stricken, but your warm freind</p>
