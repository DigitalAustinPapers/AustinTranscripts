<p><placeName>Columbia </placeName><date when="1835-05-05">5 May 35</date></p>

<p>Dear <persName>Perry</persName>,</p>

<p>There is an effort making for a new <hi rend="italic">fus </hi>and <persName>Wharton </persName>told me <persName>S. M Ws
[Williams']</persName> name was to one of the <persName>fire brand</persName> <placeName>Circulars </placeName>appended to the
govs proclamation The proclamation is well enough,</p>

<p>It only calls upon the people to support the supremacy of the laws,
But the article appended to it is, a tissue of falsehoods, got up 
apparently to break up <persName>Congress </persName>and prevent the repeal of the 400 league law
so that they may retain their speculation</p>

<p>It asserts that the <persName>Genl Govt</persName> are determined to ruin <placeName>Texas </placeName>and desire all
the <persName>N americans</persName> out of it&#8212;that they are about to seperate <placeName>Texas </placeName>from
<placeName>Coahuilla </placeName>and make it a <placeName>Military Commandancy</placeName>, for the purpose of having
it in their power to represent to the people that <placeName>Texas </placeName>is peopled with
<persName>foreigners </persName>and that then the <persName>English </persName>will in consideration of commercial
priveleges help them to conquer the <placeName>country </placeName>etc Calls upon the <persName>people</persName>
to take arms at once for self preservation etc now this is all <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>
<persName>Stephens </persName>last letter gives the lie to all of it&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Gray the printer</persName> has got a copy and as usual it will come out in the
next paper&#8212; It will be a dead stopper to immigration and Sales of land
and throw us back 2 years at least.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject I think the publication of those parts of
<persName>Stephen</persName>s letter which I marked with a pencil all important to appear in
<hi rend="italic">the next paper</hi> to Counteract this incendiary paper If you can get them
to the press this week even at some trouble and expense I beg you will do
so if you view the subject as I do</p>

<p>Cordially your friend</p>

<p>who sends many afft expressions to <persName>cousin Emilly</persName></p>

<p><persName>Henry Austin</persName></p>

<p>PS In the flour case today the <persName>Jury of <hi rend="italic">Talis men</persName></hi> pickd up in <placeName>Columbia</placeName>,
Were charged by the <persName>Judge </persName>that he considered the evidence of the <persName>Patroon
of the boat</persName> equivalent to a bill of lading</p>

<p>That <persName>Jury </persName>found the fact that <persName>Hall </persName>took the flour to his own use But
as <persName>Mr Davis</persName> swore that at the request of Hall he had charged a bbl of flour
delivd <persName>Jamieson </persName>on <persName>Captn A</persName>['s] order to him <persName>Hall </persName><persName>plaintif </persName>had recd no
Damage and must pay the costs</p>

<p>God save the people from a <persName><placeName>Texas </placeName>Jury</persName> Had the yeomanry been at
their post this would not have occurred, It has determined me to put my
household Gods in a place of safety off hand, in the dark vale</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Jas. F. Perry Esqr</persName><placeName> Peach Point</placeName> With Speede</p>
