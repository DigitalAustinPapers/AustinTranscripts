<p><date when="1831-11-25">Novr 25 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>T. H. Benton</persName></p>

<p><date n="06-xx-1830">About eighteen months</date> since I had the pleasure of receiving your
friendly letters introducing <persName>Col Woodbery</persName> who visited this <placeName>country</placeName>
with a view to a permanent Settlement and removal of his <persName>family</persName></p>

<p>I afforded <persName>Col. W.</persName> all the assistance and gave him all the 
information in my power, as it will always give me pleasure to do to any of
your <persName>friends </persName>who may visit this <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>The particular object of this letter (after acknowledgeing the
recept of yours by<persName> Col. W. </persName>and assuring you that our former 
acquaintance, in <placeName>Missouri </placeName>is still fresh on my memory,) is to 
recommend to you the bearer<persName> Mr. W. B. Travis</persName>, who probably will apply
for the appointment of<persName> U. S. consul for the <placeName>Harbor and Bay of
Galveston </placeName>in Texas</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>My personal acquaintance with<persName> Mr T.</persName> is very short and limited,
he has been recommended to me by <persName>persons of respectability</persName> and I
can with full confidence say that he has acquired the esteem and
respect of the better part of the people in the section of <placeName>country</placeName>
where he resides which is on the <placeName>Trinity river near the head of 
Galveston bay</placeName>, and I have my self no hesitation in recommending him
as a suitable person for the appointment of <persName>Consul</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><placeName>Texas </placeName>when thickly settled will no doubt require four <persName>consuls </persName>or
<persName>vice consuls</persName> on its <placeName>sea board</placeName>&#8212;one for <placeName>Galveston</placeName>, one for <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>at
the <placeName>mouth of the Brazos river</placeName>, one for <placeName>Matagorda bay</placeName>, and one for
<placeName>Aransao and the Neucis bay&#8212;</placeName>At this time I think the location of a
<persName>consul </persName>at some point on <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, with authority to appoint
<persName>vice consuls</persName> for the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>and <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>, would do&#8212;or <persName>consuls</persName>
might very properly I think be appointed now for the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>and
<placeName>Matagorda</placeName>&#8212;The most of the business of <placeName>Texas </placeName>is now done through
<placeName>Brazoria </placeName><placeName>near the mouth of the Brazos river</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I directed my <persName>friend </persName>in <placeName>Phia </placeName>to send you a copy of the <placeName>map </placeName>which
I compiled of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, published by <persName>Mr Tanner</persName> which I hope you recd,
and which will give you a correct general idea of the points I speak
of and of all <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it is not of course topografically correct, but
I think is as much so as the first maps of <placeName>unsurveyed countries</placeName> 
generally are, and perhaps more so&#8212;</p>
