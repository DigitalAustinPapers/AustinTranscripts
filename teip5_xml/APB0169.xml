<p>You must excuse my not writing sooner, agreeable to promise but
I must plead want of time as my excuse- I went to <placeName>Shepherdsville</placeName>
and <placeName>Bairdstown </placeName>after I left you at <placeName>Louisville </placeName>and returned home by
<placeName>Shelbyville </placeName>very much pleased with my trip- I met <persName>George Shannon</persName>
at <placeName>Shelbyville </placeName>and stayed a day or so with him. There is no news
here as usual except that I saw <persName>Eliza P.</persName> this morning, the little
girl you are so fond of, and I am very happy in letting you know
she was in a very good state of health; <persName>Mrs. Nat Hart </persName>has a <persName>Son</persName>
and has been very ill for several weeks but is now rather on the
mend. I got a Letter from <persName>Tho Butler</persName> at <placeName>Massac </placeName>this <date when="1810-05-17">Morning </date>he
intends Coming up this month, to see his friends and I think 
probably he will resign at least I think he is wrong if he does not for
he is now spending his time for nothing: I intend quitting <persName>Mrs.
Bodley</persName> in about six weeks and turn in to studying Law like a house
afire, for I have already spent my time with very little 
Consideration- I wish I had known two or three years ago the value of time
as well as I do now and I am sure I should have made a much
better use of it- A Young man knows not the value of time untill
it is past and then he sees his error.</p>

<p>I seen <persName>Betsey </persName><date when="1810-05-16">yesterday </date>but she was so guarded by her <persName>Mother</persName>
and <persName>Sister </persName>that I Could get no Opportunity of speaking to her. I
however intend making a movement Some of these days that shall
astonish all of them, there is nothing like acting with decision in
those Cases and I am very much mistaken if they dont experience
Some of it shortly. I then intend Coming down some where in
the <placeName>Lower Country</placeName> and try my fortune I hope you will not neglect
writing the first Opportunity or as soon as this Comes to hand; All
your <persName>Old Schoolmates</persName> or a good Many are going to the <placeName>University</placeName>
again.</p>

<p>If you see any of my old <persName>friends </persName>down Your way give my respects
to them and believe me</p>
