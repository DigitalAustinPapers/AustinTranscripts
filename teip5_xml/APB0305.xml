<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I wrote you this day to <placeName>Nachitosh </placeName>and now write again not 
knowing where to find [you]&#8212; I recd your letter from the <placeName>Arkansas </placeName>in
which you request me to purchase a <placeName>Madrid claim</placeName>&#8212; Orders have
lately come on the <placeName><persName>Surveyor</persName>s office</placeName> here to prepare the <placeName>Red River
Country</placeName> for <placeName>Market </placeName>as soon as possible and in consequence <placeName>Madrid
claims</placeName> have risen very much as the <persName>Speculators </persName>are purchasing them
up to locate on <placeName>Red River</placeName>. 12$ an acre have been offered for them
on a credit in this State of things I have determined to Sell all
your Flour here and buy a <placeName>Madrid claim</placeName> with the money, which I
will locate on My improvement in the <placeName>Long Prairie</placeName>&#8212; I advise you
to return as quick as possible with all the Money you [can] and buy
<placeName>Madrid Claims</placeName>- <persName>Doctor R. D. Dawson</persName> at <placeName>New Madrid</placeName> has some
that can be got reasonable for Cash, and if you return for this 
purpose go by there and See him</p>

<p>I hope to be off in <date n="02-xx-1818">Feby</date>. and am trying to raise your other Boat,
to go down in for the one you got from <persName>Butler </persName>is too unsafe to trust
anything in- I am anxious to hear what you think of the <placeName>Long
Prairie</placeName> In not sending the Boat I have done as if the property had
been My own-the claim if I get one shall be located for our joint
benefit- the <persName>family </persName>are all well- I should like to see you on <placeName>Red
River</placeName> but it is so uncertain when I shall be there that you ought not
to wate, but return by land as quick as you can, and Secure some land
there before it is too late</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James Bryan</persName> <placeName>Alexandria   Louisiana</placeName></p>
