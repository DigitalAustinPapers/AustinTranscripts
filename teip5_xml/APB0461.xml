<p>Dear <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I arrived here last night not as much Fatigued as I expected;
<persName>Henry Elliott</persName>, arrived the night before he left us at <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Cany Creek</placeName></hi>
where we lost one of our horses&#8212;which detained us several hours&#8212;</p>

<p>I went by <placeName><persName>Mc Donald</persName>s</placeName> for the horse but did not get him&#8212;the
horse had been stollen nearly two Years&#8212;I have examined the 
invoice of Goods left at this place&#8212; and find but few that would 
answer&#8212; and what few would answer it is impossible for me to take
on, for the want of a horse-&#8212; and time to pack the Goods&#8212; the notes
you gave me I shall leave in <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName>s Hands for Collection&#8212; as
you directed&#8212; I see in the invoice&#8212; 1 brass and one silver watch
also 1 Gun that had been lent out untill nearly ruined&#8212; If I do take
on any of the Goods they will be Madrass Hani (?) and some Beads
however there is but a poor probability of my taking on any&#8212; as
<persName>Mr. Eliott</persName> is so anxious to get on as fast as possible that if I was
not ready he would not wait a moment for me</p>

<p>He got a letter from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> a day or two later than yours;
<persName>Stephen </persName>wished everything belonging to <persName>Fathers Estate</persName> sent to<pb n="459"/>
<placeName>Orleans </placeName>consigned to <persName>Hawkins</persName>&#8212; I shall place the things in <persName>Mr.
Ashley</persName>'s care and he will send them down the first opportunity&#8212;</p>

<p>As I have not time to pack up Your Goods I shall leave all as I
found them if <persName>Mr Eliott</persName> sends goods to (Means I expect that
Yours will go on also.</p>

<p>The notes on <persName>Crow </persName>I shall take on with me but the rest I leave
here as before stated&#8212; If I had time and horse I would certainly
take on the quantity of Goods You directed&#8212; I would do anything
to promote Your Interest that lay in my Power&#8212;but as it is 
impossible for me <hi rend="italic">to take them on</hi>&#8212;I hope You will [not] impute it to
negligence on my part</p>

<p>We will have corn to pack a considerable distance and two horse [s]
would be Exquisite for <hi rend="italic">that </hi>alone&#8212; I have nothing more to say
except that I am well pleased with the <placeName>Little Rock</placeName><persName> Mr and Mrs
Ashly</persName> are well also the <persName>Doc </persName>and <persName>Family</persName>&#8212; <persName>Mrs Ashly</persName> desires her
love to <persName>Emily </persName>and will write her shortly love to <persName>Mother </persName>and <persName>sister</persName></p>

<p><persName>Jas E B Austin</persName></p>

<p>P. S. do not forget the certificate but send it on as soon as 
possible.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James Bryan</persName> Near <placeName>Herculaneum Missouri
