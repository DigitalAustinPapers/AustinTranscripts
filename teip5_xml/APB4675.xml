<p><placeName>Monclova </placeName><date when="1834-09-16">Sepr 16 34</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>We reached here the <date when="1834-09-14">day before yesterday</date>. I have found matters
still in great disorders&#8212;the <persName>old Governor</persName> abdicated and a new one
elected, by a few persons here&#8212;<placeName>Saltilla </placeName>still holding out with her
<persName>Governor </persName>besides as we understand&#8212;; a scene of things that no
human being can unravel&#8212;</p>

<p>We have no intelligence that can be relied on in regard to <persName>Col°
Austin</persName>,&#8212;There is a kind of rumor now, that he has escaped from
<placeName>prison</placeName>, but I place no confidence in it&#8212;</p>

<p>We have delayed here, to get a memorial from the present 
<persName>Governor</persName>, soliciting his discharge&#8212;We had an audience of<persName> his excellency
</persName>to day, (A very polite, amiable looking old man)  and had every<pb n="1090"/>
<hi rend="italic">assurance </hi>of his <hi rend="italic">willingness to cooperate with the <persName>Texas 
Ayuntamientos</persName></hi>.&#8212;<persName>Padilla </persName>introduced us in a very cordial manner, and this evening
he has informed us that he had made out the dispatches of the 
<persName>Governor </persName>would procure his signature in the morning, and hand then
over to us&#8212;If the <placeName>address of the Governor</placeName> should be as favorable as
it is promised to be, it may be of much service&#8212;In the morning we
shall start on our way</p>

<p>There are various rumors in regard to <persName>Santa Anna</persName>s plans&#8212;Some
of them <hi rend="italic">are very unfavorable</hi>&#8212;Time will tell which are true&#8212;I refer
you to my letter of this date to <persName>Mr Bell</persName> for the fuller account as to
these rumors etc&#8212;being at the present moment a little pressed for
time&#8212;</p>

<p>I think now we shall meet with no further delay between this and
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Mr Jack</persName> and myself are both in good health and everything
considered, in pretty good spirits&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>P. W. Grayson</persName></p>

<p>P. S. Please say to <persName>Mrs. Perry</persName>, that <hi rend="italic">I think</hi> (if my opinion is
indeed of any value) that she need entertain no fears for the fate of
her brother</p>

<p><persName>P. W. G.</persName></p>

<p>We have received the memorial desired from the <persName>Governor </persName>and it is
<hi rend="italic">all </hi>we could wish&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>P. W. G.</persName></p>

<p>The old man <persName>Padilla </persName>has been very cordial and zealous&#8212;</p>

<p><date when="1834-09-17">Sept 17</date></p>

<p>[Addressdd:] <persName>Mr James F. Perry</persName><placeName> San Fellipe de Austin Texas</placeName>
Care of <persName>Dock Miller</persName>   <placeName>San Fellipe</placeName></p>
