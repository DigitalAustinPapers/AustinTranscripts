<p><placeName>En Inquisición Mexico</placeName> <date when="1834-05-30">May 30th 1834</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. Oliver Jones</persName></p>

<p>Sir I am still in <placeName>prison </placeName>and I can form no idea when I shall be
at liberty</p>

<p>When I left <placeName>Texas </placeName>in <date n="04-xx-1833">April 1833</date> the position taken by the people
was that the evils that threatened that <placeName>country </placeName>with ruin must be
removed by the <persName>Government </persName>or the <persName>people </persName>[would] remedy them
themselves and ought to do so as in that case they would have the
right to do it. I sustained this position as the<persName> agent of the people</persName>
firmly both verbally and in writing before the <persName>ministers </persName>and the
<persName>Vice President</persName> and also in my letter to the <persName>Ayuntamiento of <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
</persName>of <date when="1833-10-02">2nd of Oct.</date> last I represented my constituents as they were when
I left them, and as I had right to believe they continued to be; 
regardless of my personal safety liberty or life, it was my duty so to<pb n="1058"/>
do&#8212;great good has resulted to <placeName>Texas </placeName>from my labors, and the noise
which this business has made&#8212;all the evils complained of have been
removed, my conscience is clear, I have discharged my duty faith
fully, and for having done so I have suffered five months inprison
ment-&#8212;Three of them in close and solitary confinement locked up
in a <placeName>dungeon </placeName>day and night, the reflection that <placeName>Texas </placeName>would be
benefited by my sufferings kept up my spirits and I have borne it all
with patience and fortitude, I have understood indirectly from
common rumor that those people in whose service I am suffering and
have sacrificed so much time and money and fatigue are now
calumniating me and rejoicing in my misfortunes, I do not believe this
report&#8212;a few may do so, but not the mass&#8212;not the <persName>farmers</persName>-
the honest and sound part of the community&#8212;they have always been
correct sound and honest in their feelings intensions, and principles
and I have no doubt that all their sympathies are in my favor
will not calumniate them even in my thoughts by believing otherwise</p>

<p>In my letter of the <date when="1834-01-17">17th January</date> from <placeName>Monterrey</placeName>, I requested them
not to suffer themselves to be excited on act. of my imprisonment
I did this to serve them, for all kinds of excitements in <placeName>Texas </placeName>are
injurious to the farming and laboring classes and to the 
improvement of that country. They complied with my request and I than
them for having done so. I also requested them to be obedient to
the <placeName>state of Coahuila and Texas</placeName>&#8212;they have been so, and for this
also thank them&#8212;God knows when I shall be at liberty&#8212;I hope
soon&#8212;a mild and respectful representation of facts from the 
<persName>Ayuntamientos of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> stating the situation of that country and of
public opinion when I left them In <date n="04-xx-1833">April last year</date>, as <persName>agent</persName>, the
position above stated taken by those people which it was my duty
as their <persName>agent </persName>to sustain, and my general character, conduct and
services in favor of good order, of the integrity of the <placeName>mexican 
territory</placeName> and of the welfare and improvement of my <placeName>adopted country</placeName>
such a representation especialy from <placeName>Bexar </placeName>would open my <placeName>dungeon</placeName>
at any time and would do it now. But perhaps this is to much to be
done for <persName>S. F. Austin</persName>, I did not think that I was doing too much
for those people when I risked everything for them.</p>

<p>I understand that the main charge against me is an attempt to
separate <placeName>Texas </placeName>from the <placeName>mexican Republic</placeName>, this charge is false as all
<placeName>Texas </placeName>can testify, however I do not know what the charge is for
up to this day no copy of charges or accusation of any kind has
been furnished&#8212;neither do I know whether I am to be judged by a
<persName>military or civil tribunal</persName> when informed of the charges against me
(and God knows when that will [be] perhaps many months hence)
it may be necessary for me to send to <placeName>Texas </placeName>for evidence, so that I
may linger away years here&#8212;the <persName>Ayuntamientos of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> might
have saved me all this,   I did not ask it but I confess that I ex-<pb n="1059"/>
pected it would have been done. If I am calumniated I consider
that it is a duty of the people there to defend me by a statement of
facts&#8212;an able and clear but short exposition to the public.</p>

<p>I hear from rumor that the <persName>state legislature</persName> have past a law to
sell the vacant lands&#8212;such a law is necessary&#8212;public sales is the
best, and only true basis for a land law, It will benefit the <placeName>state of
Coahuila and Texas</placeName> greatly and fill its treasury and also benefit
<placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;I recommend this system to the <persName>ministers </persName>here and the 
establishment of the trial by <persName>jury </persName>and the <persName>minister of relations</persName> informed
me that he had recommended both to the <persName>Government of the state</persName>
by order of the <persName>Vice president</persName>.</p>

<p>The aspect of things here indicates a great change or a civil war
of some kind, But God knows what, the<persName> people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, in my
opinion ought to have nothing to do with their family political 
quarrels and I hope they will not. All you need in <placeName>Texas </placeName>is peace, a
dead calm, and to make good crops. Remember me to all who
remember me, Show this to <persName>Capt. Martin</persName>, to <persName>D. G. Burnett</persName> and to
<persName>Miller</persName>&#8212;                                                                         </p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><date when="1834-06-02">June 2nd</date> I have just heard of the laws past by the <placeName>state </placeName>in favor
of the <persName>local government</persName> in <placeName>Texas</placeName>the establishment of three 
departments; <persName>judges</persName>, trial by <persName>jury</persName>, land law etc. In short every evil 
complained of has been remedied&#8212;this fully compensates me for all I
have suffered I do not regret it; I think it is the duty of the <persName>people
of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, to return thanks to the <persName>State Govt</persName>, in a public manner
through the <persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>for these laws, and to make a most
positive and clear declaration of their attachment and firm adhesion
and union to the <placeName>state of Coahuila and Texas</placeName> and to the <placeName>Mexican
confederation</placeName>. This ought to be done&#8212;it is due to the <placeName>state</placeName>&#8212;and
it ought to be published in the <placeName>news papers of the U. S.</placeName> in order to
correct the erroneous opinions, that have existed there as to the
intentions or <hi rend="italic">objects </hi>of the<persName> people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>,&#8212;they have been sound&#8212;
they asked for a competant organization of their <persName>local government</persName>
and nothing else, and they never had any other object, It was for
this I came to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and for this I am suffering&#8212;all this might be
embodied in the document above mentioned And the <persName>people of
<placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> would thus do justice to the State, themselves, and to me all
at the same time. Some of the <persName>enemies of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> are beginning to
snear at those people by reporting in this <placeName>city </placeName>that they have 
abandoned me and wished me sacrifised&#8212;such an idea is injurious to the
character of those people and totally false, and ought to be refuted
by a plain, frank, and public statement of facts</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
<p><persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName></p>

<p>Sir I send you the above letter which arrived here on the <date when="1834-05-09">9th inst</date>

<p>In a letter to <persName>Sam Williams</persName> of similar import to this he used
these words " I was <hi rend="italic">incommunicado regororisimo</hi> from the <date when="1834-02-13">13th Feby</date>
