<p><placeName>New York</placeName><date when="1830-11-11"> 11 Nov 1830</date>.</p>
<p>My Dear friend and <persName>Cousin</persName></p>

<p>A private oppy offering to <placeName>New Orleans </placeName>I forward a letter for
<persName>Laurence Remmey</persName> which by accident, I omitted sending by the
Nelson, which vessel I hope has arrived safe with you by this time,
as the winds have been very favorable for her, since her departure&#8212;
I also send you <persName>Mr Tornel </persName>s caution to <persName>Americans </persName>not to go to <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
which may deter some from going, until the <persName>Mexican </persName>Government
revoke the Law, to which he alludes, those who do go, I presume
will not meet with any difficulty on their arrival there&#8212;</p>

<p>You can tell <persName>Henry </persName>that his <persName>wife </persName>is now here on a visit to her
<persName>Aunt Thompson</persName>s, in very good health, and left her <persName>children </persName>in good
health, she is desirous of going to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, to join him, provided he<pb n="532"/>
meets with sufficient incouragement to remain there&#8212;   remember
me to him,</p>

<p><persName>Arch Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>There is a vessel advertised for your <placeName>Colony </placeName>and&#8212;will probably
sail in about a Fortnight&#8212;The <persName>Robert Senior</persName> Schooner&#8212; <persName>Mr.
Perry</persName> sent the cloth for your coat to this <placeName>city</placeName>, which is now making
up, I hope it will be finished in time to go by<persName> Mr. Treat</persName> who leaves
this his <persName>Brother </persName>tells me about the last of this <date n="11-xx-1830">month </date>for your
<placeName>Colony</placeName></p>
<p>
<persName>Henrys wife</persName> told me this <date when="1830-11-11">Evening </date>she had written a letter to you
given it to <persName>John </persName>to send by<persName> Mr Treat</persName> who expected to go in the
vessel alluded to I proposed her letting me send it with this, but
<persName>John </persName>was of opinion that it would reach him quicker the other way,
I however do not believe it will by some weeks&#8212;</p>

<p>I send you a file of the <placeName>American </placeName>which you will probably find
interesting, and to <persName>Henry </persName>they must be particularly so altho' we have
been deprived of arrivals by a long storm&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo S. F. Austin</persName>, <placeName>San Felipe de Austin Texas.</placeName></p>
