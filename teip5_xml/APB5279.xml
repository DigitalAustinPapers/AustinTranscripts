<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName><date when="1836-10-07"> 7 Octo&#8212; 1836</date></p>

<p><persName>Genl S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I drop you a line by the <persName>Urchin </persName>to apprise you that I am on my way to
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, and purpose coming out in the Independence, <persName>Capt. Wheelright </persName>
having promised me a berth.</p>

<p>I regret to find our fiscal concerns in a worse state than when here last&#8212;
The credit of <placeName>Texas </placeName>public and private seems to be entirely prostrate and
to make matters worse an unprecedented pressure for money has been 
occasioned by the order for specie payts at the <placeName>land offices</placeName>&#8212; Yet from, a 
conversation with <persName>Mr. Breedlove</persName> <date when="1836-10-07">this morning</date> I have reason to believe the 
<persName>subscribers </persName>to the 200 M loan would yet renew the contract and pay up on the
terms of the compromise as they understand it, that is to be at liberty to
locate their scrip when they please, but without a preference&#8212; At <persName>Mr
Breedlove</persName>s request I shall Meet some of the <persName>parties </persName>at his <placeName>office </placeName>in the 
afternoon for the purpose of learning what they will and what they will not do
for your information for they consider the honour of the <persName>Comrs </persName>as pledged
to see the contract complied with&#8212; For my own part I see no chance of the
public credit being restored until this contract is satisfactorily settled
No other loan can be effected or other scrip sold until the public faith
shall be made good as to this&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Williams </persName>I am told could do nothing with Scrip here, and they write me
from <placeName>New York</placeName> will not be able to do anything with it there&#8212; The <placeName>Texas</placeName>
fever has subsided all over the <placeName>country </placeName>and I have found myself unable to
raise money enough for the expenses of my <persName>family </persName>on any terms, or to sell
land at any rate&#8212; The statement of <persName>Col Willson</persName> and <persName>Capt Postlewait</persName>s
[Postlethwaite] damn'd everything in the upper country&#8212;and any person
offering <placeName>Texas lands</placeName> either for sale or as security rati great hazard of being
considered a swindler<pb n="434"/></p>

<p>My health was somewhat improved when I left <placeName>Lexington </placeName>but the 
<placeName>Mississippi </placeName>water has reduced me very much and I have some fever today which
makes me very feeble&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>H Austin</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] To <persName>Genl. S. F Austin</persName> <placeName>Columbia Texas</placeName> Pr. <persName>Urchin</persName></p>
