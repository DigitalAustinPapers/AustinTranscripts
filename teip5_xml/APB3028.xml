<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1825-11-10">Novr. 10th. 1825.</date></p>
<p>My Dr. <persName>Sister</persName>.</p>

<p>An opportunity offers of sending this to <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName> and as I
shall leave this place in a few days to establish myself below I
concluded to drop you a line for fear I shall not soon have another
opportunity. I wrote you a <date when="1825-10-28">few days since</date> and so did <persName>Brother</persName>&#8212;
Since then he has had a severe attack of the billious fever, but I am
happy to say he has recovered, altho he still continues very weak.
You must not omit writing me often altho I may not have so frequent opportunities of hearing from or writing to you when I
remove down the <placeName>river</placeName> I hope you will nevertheless let no opportunity miss without writing. When I write you I have matter so
little interesting that you must excuse the shortness of my letters, but
any thing from my dear <persName>Emily</persName> is always new and <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi> to me
&#8212;immured as I shall soon be in the woods by myself. I hope the
<persName>Boys</persName> progress rapidly in their studies, they ought all to be <hi rend="italic">raised
<persName>men of Business</persName></hi> how <hi rend="italic">much I lament</hi> that my <persName>father</persName> did not place
me in a situation where I could have obtained some certain method
of Supporting myself instead of pursuing the course he did. Therefore do my <persName>Sister</persName> place your <persName>boys</persName> in some situation, severally as
they arrive at a proper age, whereby they may gain a correct knowledge of some kind of bussness, when they arrive at an age when
it will become necessary for them to enter into the <hi rend="italic">World</hi> for themselves&#8212;In one of your former letters you mention a proposel made by<pb n="1233"/>
<persName>Guy Bryan</persName> of <placeName>Phila</placeName>. to provide for <persName>Guy</persName>&#8212; you know your own
feelings as a <hi rend="italic"><persName>mother </persName>best</hi> but if the opinion of a <persName>Brother </persName>is desired&#8212;I
would recommend it by all means&#8212; <persName>Austin</persName> I would like to educate
myself if I was able&#8212;and if ever I am (which I have a flattering
prospect of at present) I will do something for him&#8212;but in the
mean time I would like to see the foundation laid for his future
welfare and the first step towards it is as soon as he gets a little
older to place him in some<placeName> mercantile house</placeName> untill he is 21 years of
age&#8212; You may think your <persName>brother</persName> perhaps too plain but I have
long since found out that time rolls fast youth passes and manhood approaches apace&#8212;They are now young and you have time
to mark out the path they are to pursue either to plenty and ease
or to wretchedness and want&#8212; I will merely refer you to <persName>Brother</persName>
and myself if he had not fortunately succeeded in this enterprise
what would have become of us. Neither of us had any certain
means of support. We can profit by the errors of our <persName>father</persName> without
casting any undutiful reflections on his memory&#8212; It is time to
throw away <hi rend="italic">vain foolish pride</hi> I have banished it from me intirely
I confess I once possessed a large share, as is natural for Youths
in the situation I then thought myself&#8212; they all aught to be
raised <persName>merchants </persName>it is no shame or dishonor to bind them untill
they are of an age to act and think for themselves</p>

<p>If you can bind <persName>Austin</persName> in a <placeName>Commercial house</placeName> in the importing
business do so, and [that] will be more to his advantage and future
prospects where he can learn the French Language he can afterwards learn Spanish in this <placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212; if I live and <hi rend="italic">prosper</hi>&#8212;
<persName>Brother</persName> sends his love to you&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas. B Austin</persName></p>
<p>P. S. Kiss the little <persName>stranger </persName>for me and <persName>Mary</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mrs. Emily M. Perry</persName>. <placeName>Potosi. Missouri.</placeName> Mail.</p>
