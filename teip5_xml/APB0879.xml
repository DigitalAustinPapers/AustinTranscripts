<p><placeName>Troy </placeName><date when="1824-10-03">October 3rd 1824</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p><persName>Mr Zadock Woods</persName>, the <persName>bearer </persName>of this, returned <date n="Winter-1823">last winter</date> from the
<placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>, which place he had visited for the purpose of
ascertaining whether he could improve his situation by removing
thither:&#8212;he has satisfied himself on that head and is now starting
back with all his <persName>family</persName>.</p>

<p>As it is customary for those who value a good name, to procure
testimonials of Character from those of their fellow citizens whose
standing in Society is conspicuous, <persName>Mr Woods</persName> is desirous of 
obtaining from you a few lines to <persName>Mr Austin</persName> in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, stating your 
knowledge of his character etc&#8212;and also a letter from <persName>Major Christy</persName> and
<persName>Wm C. Carr Esq</persName>.</p>

<p>As to my knowledge of <persName>Mr Woods</persName>, I can say that during an 
acquaintance of five years, I have ever found him scrupulously just
and honorable in all his dealings.&#8212;And I can assure you that his
departure from this place is sincerely regretted by his <persName>Neighbors</persName>.&#8212;
He is a Man of industrious habits and of enterprise, but has, (as I<pb n="917"/>
presume you know) lost a Valuable estate in endeavoring to benefit
the country and himself, by exporting its produce.</p>

<p>If you can give <persName>Mr Woods</persName> a recommendation, and enable him to
procure one from each of the gentlemen I have named, you will serve
a worthy Man, and confer particular favor on</p>

<p><persName>Jn° Ruland</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>His Excelly Alexander McNair Governor of 
<placeName>Missouri St. Louis</placeName>.</persName></p>

<p><placeName>St Louis</placeName> <date when="1824-10-08">8th October 1824</date></p>

<p><persName>Mr Austin</persName></p>

<p>What is stated in the letter of <persName>Mr Ruland</persName> to me respecting <persName>Mr
Woods</persName> I know to be correct&#8212; I would have procured a letter from
<persName>Mr Carr</persName> to you but he is in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>-on a visit with his <persName>family</persName>.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your friend &amp;c.                                                       <persName>A McNair</persName></p>
