<p>Mr. E R Weightman</p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>In regard to the <placeName>salt lots</placeName>. I think that if you could lease to
<persName>Burnham</persName>, and give him the previlege for a certain number of years-
say three or four or five, on condition that he kept the <placeName>works </placeName>agoing,
and at the end of the lease the <placeName>lots </placeName>to be given up with such 
improvements and kettles etc as may then be on the place, without
binding him to any specific kind or value of improvements&#8212;The
main object is to start the thing now for the benifit of the <placeName>place</placeName>,
the <placeName>lots </placeName>hereafter will be valuable, and it is better to give the use
of the <placeName>lots </placeName>for nothing for a certain number of years than to sell-
also it is better to give the previlege to <persName>Burnham </persName>to keep all his
kettles when his time is out-&#8212; This is my opinion-tho you must do
as you think best or proper and either sell or lease as may be thought
by you best&#8212;</p>

<p>I am ready at any time to give you a full power of attorney as
<persName>agent of the proprietors</persName>, I proposed to <persName>League </persName>on my return <date n="Summer - 1829">last
summer</date> to go immediately down and he promised to do so, but has
been in bad health&#8212; As soon as it is possible for me to do so I will
go down there and make a final arrangement and in the meantime
I will agree to any dispositions of <placeName>lots </placeName>to actual <persName>settlers </persName>who im-<pb n="281"/>
prove them, that you may make&#8212; The time has not quite arrived
to push that <placeName>place</placeName>&#8212;there must be some more <placeName>settlements </placeName>and some
more wealth round<placeName> Bay Prairie</placeName> and <placeName>on the river </placeName>and it will not
advance the place much to sell lots at this time, for they will get
into the hands of <persName>persons </persName>who will keep them merely for 
speculation and they had better remain in the hands of the <persName>proprietors</persName>
than in any others. I am in favor of letting <placeName>lots </placeName>go to actual <persName>settlers</persName>
who will improve them but think that the <placeName>lots </placeName>will be better in the
hands of the <persName>proprietors </persName>than in those of such persons as would
be likely to buy at a <placeName>public sale </placeName>at this time, tho I am willing to do
on my part whatever may be thought best&#8212;</p>

<p>I have been greatly disappointed by the long delay of the 
<persName>Commissioner</persName>&#8212; I do not expect him now for <date when="1829-11-25">three weeks</date>&#8212;and I can do nothing until] he arrives.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p><date when="1829-11-04">Nov 4. 1829</date></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. Elias E. Weightman</persName> <placeName>Matagorda</placeName> <persName>Cap. Burnham</persName></p>
