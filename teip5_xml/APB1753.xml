<p>You will perceive by the enclosed printed proclamation of his
<persName>Excellency the Governor</persName> and official letter of the <persName>Chief of Depart-<pb n="247"/>
ment</persName>, that the inveterate <persName>enemy of our republic</persName> has landed on the
<placeName>coast of Tamaulipas</placeName> and that the <persName>Govr </persName>has ordered that the <persName>militia
of the State</persName> should be placed in the best possible State for active
operations. In cumplyance with this order I have directed the 
<persName>Captains </persName>to muster their respective <persName>companies </persName>with the least possible
delay and inspect them and return to the first adjutant a full 
statement of their force arms etc.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Bakus</persName> of the Schooner Augusta who came into <placeName>Galveston </placeName>a
few days since from <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, reports that he was boarded off the
<placeName>Mississippi </placeName>by the boats of a <persName>Spanish </persName>frigate that had been 
dismasted;] in a storm off <placeName>Tampico</placeName>&#8212;this fact warns us that the
<persName>enemy </persName>are near us, and some storm, or other circumstance may throw
them onto our <placeName>coast</placeName>. Supposing that such a case is possible, I have
directed <persName>Caps Baily and Sims</persName> to be watchful, and I must request
that you should also be in readiness to repair to the <placeName>coast </placeName>at the
first alarm and should an <persName>enemy </persName>appear, take such measures as 
circumstances may permit to prevent them from taking the stock of
cattle horses, hogs, etc., which would be an important supply for
them&#8212;and you will inform me by express of whatever may occur,
and of the force and appearance of any <persName>enemy </persName>who may be 
discovered, and give me such or other information as you may deem
important to the public service and to the security of the <persName>people of
this <placeName>jurisdiction</placeName></persName>.</p>
