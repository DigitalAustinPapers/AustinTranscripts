<p><date when="1826-08-18">18th August 1826</date>&#8212;Early in the morning</p>

<p>On <placeName>tide water of the Labacca</placeName>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I am <placeName>about 10 miles up the river</placeName>, from where it emties into a large
arm of the <placeName>Bay </placeName>&#8212;the <placeName>river for three or four miles above that place,
hugs or bluffs the main land on the N. E. side</placeName>&#8212;the <placeName>marsh </placeName>I suppose
to be about 4 miles wide. The river from the <placeName>Tascosite road</placeName> down
is verry crooked tho in the main bears S. E.</p>

<p><placeName>Adjoining the main land on the west side</placeName> there is generally fine
<placeName>large deep lakes</placeName> that communicate with the river.</p>

<p>I have selected a <placeName>Town cite</placeName> <placeName>near the head of tide</placeName>&#8212;the <placeName>river </placeName>at that
place appears deep, and is about 25 or 30 yards wide&#8212;at the <placeName>upper
end of the cite</placeName>&#8212;at the Lower end, about from 40 to 60&#8212;and then
widens to distance of about 300 yards.</p>

<p>Timber is rather scarce below the <placeName>Town cite</placeName>&#8212;tho the land is good
to the <placeName>arm of the bay</placeName>, and the water not too salt for any kind of 
cooking except tea and coffee. I have concluded to survey all the land off
in Labor tracts, and I believe they will settle whather they have
timber or not&#8212;Some of which will have little or none. <placeName>After the river
Enters the arm of the bay the bank on the E. side </placeName><placeName>bears nearly 
Southwest and terminates about 8 or 10 miles nearly S. from the shoulder
of the main land on the W. side</placeName>&#8212;I saw something resembling a very
small <placeName>Island </placeName>from the shoulder it bears<placeName> S. 16° E. the distance to it I
made 22 miles 6/10</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The <placeName>Chicalet </placeName>emties in <placeName>about 4 miles below the road the mouth of
the Navadad </placeName>is yet unknown: I am of opinion there is <placeName>more good land
on the E side than on the west.</placeName></p>

<p>I should be very glad to get a piece from you, that is situated a
few miles below wher I intend to lay off a <placeName>Town</placeName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that if this <placeName>Town </placeName>Could be Dispensed with by
the <persName>Empresario</persName>, and the same be made by an <persName>individual </persName>it would
be much better&#8212;it will require<placeName> 6 miles on a right line front on the<pb n="1426"/>
river </placeName>if laid out under the law, and if by individual 2 or 3 would
do&#8212;then there could be<placeName> 9 or 10 Labors more</placeName> etc&#8212;12 Oclock we are
now at the <placeName>Town cite</placeName> and I have got four of the <persName>company </persName>to swim
the river and hunt for the <placeName>navadad</placeName>,&#8212;we have for 3 days seen smoke
in the direction they are going&#8212;I am now of the Opinion that the
<placeName>navadad </placeName>enters the bay by a <placeName>separate mouth</placeName>&#8212; Two men of my
<persName>Company </persName>told me They had been down the <placeName>Chickolet </placeName>to <placeName>tide
water</placeName> and that tide flowed up it <placeName>3 or 4 miles above its junction</placeName> with
the <placeName>Labacca</placeName>&#8212;all this was false&#8212;they both stated that they had
marked land in the <placeName>forks </placeName>of the same, and when we crossed the
<placeName>Chickolet </placeName>it did not corispond with the statement they had made,
and we presumed that it might be a<placeName> spring branch,</placeName>&#8212;so we 
neglected examining the <placeName>labacca </placeName>for several miles&#8212;following a course (as
they said) would take us near the head of tide on the <placeName>Chickolet</placeName>, and
ultimately found ourselves in the main <placeName>Guadaloupe Prairie</placeName>&#8212;I then
changed my course and struck the river about <placeName>7 or 8 miles above the
town site</placeName> where I found fine ritch first bottom, some which however
overflows&#8212; And most excellent second bottom and plenty of good
timber&#8212; The timber here prevented me from seeing with any 
satisfaction the <placeName>E side of the river</placeName>, further than there appeared to be
one continued bottom and well timbered near the river. It has been
misting rain while I have been writing and our <persName>company </persName>is rather
in confusion, and I have to fear what I have written will rather
confuse then give the information I at first expected&#8212;nothing more
until the <persName>boys </persName>return who have gone to hunt <placeName>Navadad</placeName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>6 Oclock men has returned and state that they traveled<placeName> East about
4 miles came to a lively runing Creek</placeName>, went down but a short
distance to tide, fine timber on this <placeName>creek</placeName>&#8212; Good bottom and
<placeName>upland prairie between it and the Labacca&#8212;</placeName>about <placeName>2 or 3 miles
furder East they seen heavy bodys of timber</placeName> and which they believe
to be the timber of the <placeName>Navadad </placeName>say six or seven miles distant from
this river and that the timber appeared to bear near a parallel
course with the <placeName>Labacca</placeName>&#8212;this the more confirms me in the belief
that this <placeName>River </placeName>and the <placeName>navadad </placeName>does not unite before they Get into
the <placeName>bay</placeName>, and very probebly their mouths are 5, 6 or 7 miles apart&#8212;</p>

<p>I start for <placeName>Gonzalez </placeName>in the morning&#8212;-I will only add that no
place on earth can exceed this for beauty-&#8212; The <placeName>Elisian fields</placeName> of
the <placeName>Mehometan Paradise</placeName> never was so delightsome as the 
<placeName>Prairies</placeName>.&#8212;</p>
