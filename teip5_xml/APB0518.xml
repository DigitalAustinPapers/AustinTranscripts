<p><placeName>Nachitoches </placeName><date when="1822-06-06">June 6th 1822</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The last letter I Recd from your <persName>Brother </persName>he advised me of his
going to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and that you would Remain at <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> and
would send his letters on I wrote some Days ago by <persName>Mr. James F.
Walker</persName> of <placeName>alibami </placeName>the <persName>Brother </persName>to <persName>Walker </persName>the <persName>senator in Congress</persName><pb n="525"/>
in or with that letter I sent a Book Entitled the Rights of Man by
<persName>Thomas Paine</persName> and translated into Spanish and published by <persName>Mr
Gary of <placeName>Philada</placeName>'</persName> for the particular use and benefit of <placeName>Spanish 
America</placeName> when that Book arrives I wish it may be presented to the 
<persName>Governor </persName>for his Perusal and then forwarded to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>or elsewhere, as
your <persName>Brother </persName>and the <persName>Governor </persName>may advise where they may think it
may be most use full&#8212;<persName>General Wilkinson</persName> sailed from <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> for
<placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> in <date n="03-xx-1822">March </date>and intended to go from thence to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, but
we hear he was not permitted to Land at <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> and Intended
to Land at some other place and go on to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, his business is
private and nothing to do with the <persName>government of the <placeName>United
States</placeName></persName>&#8212;It seems by communications from <placeName>Washington </placeName>that the <persName>Govt
of <placeName>Spain</placeName></persName> Entirely disapproves of the <placeName>Cordova </placeName>convention and
mean to make other Efforts to reduce the Rebellious <persName>Mexicans </persName>to
submission to the Despotism under which that Country has so 
long-groaned; our <persName>Government </persName>having acknowledged the independency
of <placeName>Spanish American</placeName> seems to have greatly offended the <persName>Spanish
Minister at <placeName>Washington</placeName></persName> and will no doubt the <placeName>Court of Madrid</placeName>,
when the news arrives there some <persName>United States ministers</persName> or charges
affairs or <persName>Agents </persName>will be sent not only to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>but to all the other
<placeName>Provinces to the South</placeName>; no appointments are yet made. The <persName>court of
<placeName>Spain</placeName></persName> has appointed a <persName>commissioner </persName>to run the line agreeable to the
Treaty but our <persName>government </persName>will not proceed to Run the line provided
the Existing <persName>Govt of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> objects to it. we wish to cultivate the
most friendly terms with that <persName>Govt </persName>- <persName>Mr. Hawkins</persName> of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>
Informs me that by the Return of the Schooner Lively all the 
unfavourable impressions Respecting the Navigation into the <placeName>Mouth of
the Collerado</placeName> are removed, that the safe and capacios <placeName>harbour </placeName>
perfectly Land Locked within two miles of the <placeName>Mouth of the River</placeName> more
than compensates for the shoal water in its mouth where lighters must
be used; <persName>Emigrants </persName>in very great numbers seem setting that way, and
many to <placeName>Galveston </placeName>and its vicinity&#8212;these people go determined to
support the <persName>Republican Government</persName> and be Good <persName>Citizens </persName>and will
be so I believe&#8212; I Enclose a few more papers which your <persName>brother</persName>
will be glad to see. They will afford some Idea of the general 
Politicks of <placeName>America </placeName>and <placeName>Europe</placeName>. I beg you to inform me when your
<persName>Brother </persName>returns</p>

<p><persName>John Sibley  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Austin Junr.</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Stephen F. Austin Esqr.</persName> or in his absence to <persName>Mr
Austin</persName> his <persName>Brother </persName><placeName>St Antonio </placeName>  By <persName>John Regles</persName>.</p>
