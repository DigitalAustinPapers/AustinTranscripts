<p><persName>Honble Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir. I have nothing new to inform you of relative to the
intentions of <persName>Mrs Hawkins</persName>, further than what I mentioned in my
last letter some weeks ago&#8212;I do not believe <persName>Mr Sanders</persName> and <persName>Mr
Hawes</persName> will ever agree that she should move to <placeName>Texas </placeName>while her
<persName>family </persName>are so young and helpless&#8212;If her boys were older and had
more Judgement and Experience in the world I dont believe she
would be controlled but alas the children have been so much 
neglected that even at an advanced age I fear they will be illy calculated
to take care of themselves even&#8212;</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it has been by all decided that you
are to act in the capacity of <persName>friend </persName>and <persName>agent </persName>of <persName>Mrs Hawkins</persName> and
the <persName>children</persName>; this decision meets my most sanguine approbation, as
I am assured she could get no person so well quallified to represent
her Interest in the provenee&#8212;-I hope therefore you will not let your
delicacy prevent your accepting such a trust&#8212;</p>

<p>On the subject of the advances made by <persName>Mr Hawkins</persName> it never was
my opinion that you were any otherwise bound than for one half
of All lands granted to you by the <persName>Mexican Government</persName>&#8212;and that
the only source of remuneration would be from a sale thereof,&#8212;</p>

<p>There has been many small sums loaned to individuals going to
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, and for which they are bound these I will send you a list
of at a more convenient time and request you to have them collected&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Nath: Cox.</persName></p>

<p><persName>Mr Botts</persName> is now here and I believe intends writing you by <persName>Mr
Parker</persName> the <persName>bear[er]</persName> of this.</p>
