<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have just learnt (Indirectly) that you have <persName>old Roe</persName> in custody
and that you inte[n]ded keeping him so until you should hear my
opinion as to what tribe of <persName>Indians </persName>committed the hostilities on the
<placeName>Guadaloupe </placeName>etc.</p>

<p>I have to presume that you ear this have been satisfactorily 
informed by <persName>Mr. Wightman</persName> on the subject&#8212;I however will state that
there is not a doubt of its haveing been the <persName>Wakows </persName>that attacked my
<placeName>house </placeName>and killd <persName>Whightman</persName>.</p>

<p>There is some doubt as to the <persName>tribe </persName>that that <persName>party </persName>belonged to that 
attacked <persName>Dirben</persName>, in as much as they had been encamped several Days
<placeName>near the place where they shot at <persName>Derbin</persName></placeName> and tho. they were not
trailed from the place, after that they had taken the Horses&#8212;yet<pb n="1378"/>
there was on the next morning a trail discovered by <persName>Mr. phillips</persName> in
<placeName>the road west of my house and leading to a crossing of the river</placeName>-
He followed it, and discovered that 4 horse and one mule had made
said trail and that he believed the mule track to be mine as there
was a Gap in one of hir fore feet&#8212;<persName>Colo. Matson</persName> and <persName>E. Smith</persName> crossed
the <placeName>river </placeName>some days after and followed said trail to where it took a
Direct course for <placeName>Laberdee</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Mr. Smith</persName>'s statement as to the number
of horses and the mule coresponded with what <persName>phillips </persName>had stated.</p>

<p>I did on the first view of the premisis suspect that <persName>the party </persName>that
fired on <persName>Derbin </persName>had been of the main body that killd <persName>mr. Wightman</persName>;
but I am of a Different opinion now, and admit a faint probibelity
that it was the <persName>Tankawas </persName>that attacked <persName>Derbin</persName>. I admit this because
they must have been a <persName>foot party</persName>; the horses and mule crossing the
trail of the other <persName>party </persName>and that too on a direction to the crossing well
known to the <persName>tankawas </persName>and near to my house; and the trail being
made while the due was on, a Monday mor[n]ing.</p>

<p>I am unable to give an Idea relative to <persName>Roe</persName>. Admit however that
his intentions were bad, he has not been with the <persName>tankawas </persName>since he
made threats that I know of; tho I conceive him ameanable to the
Laws for those threats in point of "Malice aforethought."</p>

<p>It is as yet uncertain what day I shall see you, but I presume not
many&#8212;<persName>Derbin </persName>is on the men[d] ; the other man <persName>Mr. Shields</persName> I have
rather Dispaired of&#8212;</p>

<p>Note.    Excuse haste.</p>

<p><persName>James Kerr</persName></p>
<p>
<date when="1826-07-19">19th</date> I wrote least night 10 o'clock&#8212;now I can rite <persName>shields </persName>is
better.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo. S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>St. Felipe de Austin</placeName> <persName>Capt.
Dickson</persName>.</p>
