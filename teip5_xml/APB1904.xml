<p><placeName>Brasoria </placeName><date when="1830-04-15">April 15 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>Col S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dr Sir <persName>Mr. Saml Williams</persName> has never yet sent the papers for
the Sloop althoug[h] I have written him at two different times
since he left this <placeName>place </placeName>to send them down and if no safe 
opportunity offered to hire some <persName>person </persName>to come down that there might
be no disapointment the Sloop left this <date when="1830-04-10">five days ago</date> and has been
laying at the <placeName>mouth of the River</placeName> <date when="1830-04-12">two or three days</date> with a fair wind
but could not proceed for want of papers four days since we 
dispatched a <persName>messenger </persName>to <placeName>San Felipe</placeName> who ought to have returned
<date when="1830-04-14">yesterday </date>by 12 oClock he has not yet come I think <persName>Williams</persName>
has detained him, it is a verry serious injury to us the season is far
advanced and our Corn is somewhat injured and it is all important
that we should get it to market imediately; I do not know <persName>Mr
Williams</persName> reasons for treating us so unfriendly when he has 
received favours from our concern and never has yet been denied, if
our buisness could have been done at another place I then would
not have thought so hard of <persName>Williams </persName>but he knowing that we were
dependent on him for the papers he ought to have given more 
attention to it,</p>
