<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I arrived in <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>on the <date when="1835-11-13">13th Inst</date> and found that the heavy piece of
Cannon had been put <placeName>on board the San Felipe</placeName> which had gone in pursuit
of a Mexican Armed Vessel and was lost inside the <placeName>Matagorda Bay</placeName> the
guns was however saved and landed on <placeName>bird Island</placeName> on getting this 
information I despatched <persName>Mr Tanner</persName> to <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>with letters to the <persName>Committee</persName>
of that place requesting any assistance that might be necessary in [order to]<pb n="265"/>
get it to the <placeName>main land</placeName> and to forward it on to the <placeName>Camp </placeName>with all speed, 
intending to follow on myself so soon as I could provide some means by
which a <persName>Company of Volunteers from <placeName>New-Orleans</placeName></persName> could be enabled to join
the <persName>army </persName>they had arrived some days previous and was very much 
disatisfied at the delay. I left on the <date when="1835-11-18">18th</date> calculated on joining the cannon at 
<placeName>Matagorda </placeName>or <placeName>on the road</placeName> on My way I met <persName>Mr Patton</persName> directly from 
<placeName>Matagorda </placeName>who told me that the Schooner William Robbins had sailed on the
<date when="1835-11-13">13th Inst</date>&#8212;from that place with the Intention of taking the Cannon <placeName>on board</placeName>
and bringing it round to the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>I have therefore delayed and have sent
<persName>expresses </persName>to both places&#8212;and so soon as I can learn at what point the
cannon can be found I will use every exertion to get her to <placeName>Bexar</placeName>&#8212;the
weather has been excessively bad and the <placeName>roads </placeName>are very muddy however
nothing shall be wanting to expedite matters&#8212; I wrote you on the <date when="1835-11-18">18th
inst</date> tendering my resignation at the same time I shall be proud and
ready to execute any orders in my power and to give any pecuniary aid that
my means will justify</p>
