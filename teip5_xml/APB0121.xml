<p><placeName>St. Genevieve </placeName><date when="1807-08-17">17 Aug. 1807.</date></p>
<p>My deae Sir :</p>

<p>It is now past the <date when="1807-08-17">middle of August</date> and definite arrangement
is not made about my <persName>Families </persName>and <persName>Horace Austin</persName> etc coming on
I feel anxious about it&#8212; They certainly ought to leave <placeName>New Haven</placeName>
at farthest the <date when="1807-10-20">20. Octr.</date> I have written them to that effect&#8212;I have
Proposed to have a Carriage and four Horses proceed to bring on all
the <persName>women </persName>and <persName>Children </persName>and <persName>Horace Austin</persName> to <placeName>Pittsburgh </placeName>and to
furnish <persName>Horace </persName>with $200 to pay their expenses, what Articles of
Furnature etc which are to come on, to be sent to <placeName>N. York</placeName> to come
with <persName>Austin Eliott </persName>to <placeName>Wheling</placeName>, which I think will be far preferable
than going to <placeName>Pittsburgh</placeName>&#8212;I have also written them, you will meet
those at <placeName>Pittsg </placeName>Procure Boats etc and meet <persName>Eliott </persName>at Wheeling this
arrangement appears to me to be by far the most Preferable&#8212;
nevertheless, I wish to know whether it meets your approbation and
whether you will on your part put it in execution and when you will
probably go on yourself. I am told <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> don't think <persName>Eliott</persName>
will be able to return before <date n="Spring-1808">next Spring</date>&#8212;this would derange my
plans and expectations very much as of course <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> don't
expect to be in <placeName>N. York</placeName> before <date n="Fall-1806">late in the fall</date>&#8212; Therefore, if you
really expect <persName>Elliott </persName>on this <date n="Fall-1806">fall</date>, had you not better get a [letter]
from <persName>Spencer </persName>to <persName>Mr. Corp</persName> and forward on immediately to <persName>Eliott</persName>&#8212;
there is no probability of <persName>Spencer</persName>s being there before they must
come away, if they come before <date n="Spring-1807">next Spring</date>&#8212;I wish you would write
me by the first Opportunity and send the necessary letters to be 
forwarded as you must calculate at least 6 Weeks in their getting to
<placeName>N Haven</placeName>, after they leave here.&#8212;I am glad to hear, by <persName>Judge
Shrader</persName>, that the hay-making Business ended so well&#8212;only Exercise
patience and forbareance for a little time and I have no doubt all
things will work well in this Land of contention and discord&#8212; I
was sorry to find you so little disposed to lend a sheltering hand
to our proposed <placeName>Academy</placeName>&#8212;I am sure the <persName>Judge </persName>must applied to
you, when in one of your Gloomy and desponding Moments&#8212;When
you awake to the importance of such an Institution, to the welfare
of this <placeName>Territory </placeName>and to the young and rising generation, it will
draw from you your wonted and liberal aide I should feel hurt
not to see your name to that Subscription&#8212; I must confess I 
expected more than $10. from our friend <persName>James Austin</persName>, I think when
he reflects that he has [a gro]wing <persName>Family</persName>, who will partake of the
benefits arising from such an Institution, it will draw from him an
additional Subscription&#8212;I feel deeply interested in having the thing<pb n="184"/>
go into effect&#8212;but unless we can obtain in the <placeName>Territory </placeName>at least
$4000 by subscription the thing must be abandoned&#8212;<persName>Friends </persName>here
are all well-&#8212;give my Respects to all <persName>Friends</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>T. Phelps</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Moses Austin Esqr. Merchant</persName><placeName> Mine A. Burton</placeName> By
<persName>Mr. Hull</persName>&#8212;</p>
