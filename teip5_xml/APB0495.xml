your one use&#8212;let us know if flower and Whiskey will sell well, it
tis Said provisions of all kinds is high and Scarse, but this does not
frighten the people from going. I am only fearfull you will not
have as much land as the great number of <persName>famalys </persName>will want, even
admitting that one half of the people goes that talks of moveing,
and at the Same time reserve as much for your Self and <persName>famaly </persName>as
will pay you for all your trouble. I beg my dear <persName>Son </persName>will not let
his Generousity go So far&#8212;as to injure himself, but Secure a 
Sufficient quantity of land to place his fallen <persName>famaly </persName>in their former
State of Independance, truly my beloved <persName>Sons</persName>, this <placeName>grant </placeName>of land
was bought with a price&#8212;even the precious life of your dear <persName>Father</persName>,
for I am Sertain it was oing to fatigue and hardship that deprived
him of his health and finally ended in death, at the moment when he
thought he was about to receive a reward for all his exertions and
sevear tryals, but the lords will be done. I have good reason to
think your dear <persName>Father </persName>will receive his reward in <placeName>heaven</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Mr alley
