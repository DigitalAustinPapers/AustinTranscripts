<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Your public duties will no doubt occupy nearly all your thoughts at
this critical conjunction of your public affairs yet the solicitude of one
about a <persName>Brother </persName>in the midst of danger must be my apology for asking
your attention a few moments. I wish to enquire if you know any [thing]
of <persName>Mr. James McNair</persName>? He may not have come to your notice, being a
plain unassuming man, but sterling in those qualities which make a good
citizen&#8212;industry integrity and honesty of purpose. His place is on the
<placeName>Colorado</placeName>, near <placeName>Eagle Lake</placeName>, a little <placeName>below <persName>Wm. Alley</persName>'s ferry</placeName> and I believe
near the place where he help'd to plant the first corn within your <placeName>colony</placeName>
in the <date n="Spring-1822">spring of 1822</date>. But to assist you in making a little enquiry to find
out his present condition I will briefly state that he was here <date n="Winter-1835">last winter</date>
was a year on my invitation and return'd with Messrs. <persName>Mather </persName>and <persName>Morris</persName>,
in the Schooner Jane Corroline (having some goods which I sent with him)
since which time I have heard from him but twice His last letter was dated
<date when="1836-03-03">3d of March last</date>, at <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>and stated that he was that day draughted
into the Militia, and was to join the <persName>army </persName><date when="1836-03-04">next morning</date>. Now the Battle
of <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> has been fought since that and I am left to conjecture
whether he has survived or not.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Sir, as, from what I have heard of you, there is no
person in <placeName>Texas </placeName>who I would be more likely to interest in the cause of
humanity than yourself, I confidently trust that, the motives which dictate<pb n="424"/>
this, finding a ready response in your bosom, you will take a little trouble
to find out whether my <persName>Brother </persName>be alive and well, or otherwise</p>

<p><persName>James </persName>being an <persName>old settler</persName> must be pretty well known along the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>
but it is likely he is best known amongst the <persName>settlers </persName>If you would be kind
enough to reply to this I should be very much obliged to you</p>

<p><persName>Wm. McNair</persName>,<placeName> 750 Greenwich Street</placeName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>General Stephen F Austin</persName> of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
Care of <persName>Mr. James W Breedlove Collector <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></persName></p>
