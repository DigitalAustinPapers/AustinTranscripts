<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1830-06-14">14 June 1830.</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>You have no doubt seen published in the <placeName>news papers</placeName> the law of
<date when="1830-04-06">6 of april </date>passed by the<persName> Mexican Congress</persName> relative to emigration
from the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The 10 article of that law declares that no variation shall be
made in the <placeName>colonies already established</placeName>&#8212; Mine is established, and
no embarassments can be legally enterposed to the imigration of
honest and good men of <persName>families</persName>, who are comprehended in my 
contracts<pb n="418"/></p>

<p>It will be necessary for <persName>emigrants </persName>to procure pasports from some
<persName>Mexican consul</persName>&#8212;the law requires it, and one pasport for the <persName>head
of the family</persName> answers for the whole, but the number of the <persName>family</persName>
should be stated. They should report themselves to the <persName>local 
authorities of the <placeName>frontier</placeName>,</persName> or <placeName>port </placeName>where they enter, and the 
recommendations of good character which the colonization law requires must be
produced. Those recommendations should be given by a <persName>Judge </persName>or
some <persName>civil authority</persName> of the place where the <persName>emigrant </persName>removes from,
of <persName>a higher grade than a justice of the peace</persName></p>

<p>The Government have ordered that the 13 article of the State
constitution should be rigidly enforced, that article is as follows
" No one can be born a <persName>Slave in this <placeName>state</placeName></persName> after the publication of this
Constitution in the <placeName>capital of each civil jurisdiction</placeName>; and <date when="1830-10-06">six months
after such publication</date> the introduction of <persName>Slaves </persName>is prohibited, under
any pretext whatever" The constitution was approved the <date when="1827-03-11">11 of
March 1827</date> and published in due form at this place in <date n="05-xx-1830">May </date>of that
year&#8212; A law has been subsequently passed by the <persName>Legislature of
the State </persName>garanteeing all contracts made in <placeName>foreign contries</placeName>, with
<persName>hirelings </persName>or <persName>indented servants</persName></p>

<p>No duties will be collected untill <date n="12-xx-1830">after November</date> as I informed
you when here. The law of<date when="1830-04-06"> 6 april last</date> permits the free introduction
of all Kinds of provisions and lumber into <placeName>Galveston </placeName>and <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>
for two years free of duty, also all kind of furniture tools etc for
the use of the <persName>colonists </persName>is free of duty&#8212;Tobacco is contraband as it
always has been and will be seized. The exportation of the produce
of the <placeName>colonies </placeName>in foreign vessels is permitted by the Same law to the
<placeName>ports of Matamoros, Tampico and vera Cruz</placeName>, or in other words
foreign vessels are allowed to engage in the coasting trade from
the <placeName>colonies </placeName>to the above Mentioned <placeName>ports</placeName>.</p>

<p>The main object of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6th of april</date> is to keep out turbulent
and bad men <persName>vagabonds </persName>and <persName>Slaves</persName>, and the true prosperity and
happiness of this <placeName>country </placeName>requires that all of those classes should be
for ever kept out&#8212; The honest and industrious <persName>farmer </persName>who brings
his <persName>family </persName>has nothing to fear and will be well received and obtain
more benifits and privileges than have ever been granted by any
Govt, on earth.</p>

<p>The imprudence and thoughtlessness of some on the <placeName>Sabine 
frontiers </placeName>and the excessive noise that has been made in the <placeName>U. S. papers</placeName>
about the purchase of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, seems to have had a much greater
weight in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>than a matter so essentially unimportant ought to
have had. It appears to have caused an impression that the <persName>North
Americans</persName> are all turbulent and that the Govno of <placeName>the north </placeName>wish to<pb n="419"/>
take <placeName>Texas </placeName>by force right or wrong. All these impressions are 
erronious and have been created by the reports of some <persName>evil minded persons</persName>
for the purpose of trying to extort from this Govt, unjust and 
arbitrary measures against the <persName>colonist</persName>, so as to foment discontent in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>. Those persons have also been trying to sow the seeds of
suspicion and jealousy against the Govt, of the <placeName>U. S</placeName>. with the hope
no doubt that a war might be brought about between the two <placeName>nations</placeName>,
in which event <placeName>Texas </placeName>would be lost to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>in one campain. A
train seems to have been laid by some one, to drive this Govt, to
such acts as would be most likely to kindle discontent in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and
at the same time to sow the seeds of disgust between the two <placeName>nations</placeName>,
and the means which appear to have been adopted to effect those
objects seem to be to operate on the credulity of this Govt, by false
reports about the <persName>colonists</persName>, and the views of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> They appear
to have made this Govt, believe that an offer to buy <placeName>Texas</placeName>, by the
<placeName>U. S.</placeName> was a declaration that it would be taken by force right or
wrong. These things will all correct themselves. The Govt, will
find on a proper examination that the <persName>colonists </persName>have done their duty
faithfully as <persName>mexican citizens</persName>, that they have performed important
and essential services to their <placeName>adopted country</placeName>, and that they deserve
the highest confidence.</p>

<p>I returned from <placeName>Bexar the capital of Texas</placeName> a few days since, all
is peace and quietness&#8212; <persName>Genl Teran</persName> is expected soon but without
many <persName>troops</persName>&#8212; I am on the best of terms with that <persName>General </persName>and
with all the <persName>officers of Govt, </persName>and think that I shall be able [to]
work this <placeName>colony </placeName>through all troubles which <hi rend="italic">seem </hi>to threaten it.
I <hi rend="italic">know </hi>the <persName>Mexicans </persName>well&#8212;. The latest accounts from <placeName>Mexico </placeName>give
a bad a/c of the State of things in that quarter&#8212; those matters
do not reach or affect us here&#8212;</p>
