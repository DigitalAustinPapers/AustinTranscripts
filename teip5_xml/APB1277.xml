<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>After so long a time the <persName>sawyers </persName>are come on to gow to work at
your plank. I hope you will excuse me, for it was completely out of
my power to send sooner.</p>

<p>I have made my bargain so that you have to furnish them 
provission and pay them One dollar pr. hundred after the logs are hewd.
I wish you to call on <persName>Mr Mason</persName> who is at <persName>Mr Iron</persName>s who is to hew the
stuff. Also furnish <persName>Mason </persName>with that Bill of hewing, and the <persName>sawyers</persName>
will [with] the bill of sawing that I left with you. Draw off the
bill of hewing on a separate piece of paper and hand to <persName>Mason</persName>. Be
so good as to gow with the <persName>workman </persName>and show them the place and
timber, and after the stock for the plank and scantling is hewn, and
<persName>Mason </persName>comes back to <placeName>Sn Filipe</placeName>, show him where to hew the sills and
sleepers etc</p>

<p>If <persName>Mr Williams</persName> still continues in the notion of building, let his
bill remain with your own, if he has declined building, take his part
out of your bill, so that the <persName>sawyers </persName>may not be bothered.</p>

<p>I expected to have come over with the <persName>sawyers</persName>, but owing to 
company and having no person to assist my <persName>wife</persName>, I am obliged to remain
at home, but I hope there will be no dificulty. Be perticular in 
getting sound timber for your planks   Have the flooring planks hauled<pb n="1452"/>
as soon as it is sawn so that it may draw as soon as possible, And as
soon [as] <persName>Mason </persName>returns and hews the sills etc let me know it and I
will come on to work. You will have to send for your saw as <persName>Mr
Keels</persName> has sold his saw without my knowledge, and there is no other
saw to be had here.</p>

<p><persName>Saml C. Hiram</persName>s</p>
<p><persName>Col. S. F. Austin</persName></p>
