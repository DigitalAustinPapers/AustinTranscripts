<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I heave wrote several Letters to you and others  But
has never, Received a line from There&#8212;and I heare so many 
contradicktry Reports that I can Heave no confidence,   some Times I heare
that It is your wish I would Return and then I heare that, the
<persName>officers </persName>would give 3 or 4 of The <persName>Prisners </persName>for me, That I Do not
know what To Think;    But I feerme There are <persName>men </persName>on The <placeName>Aish
Bayou</placeName> who are Indistrious to sirculate Reports, so as to still keep
up contention Between the <persName>Parties</persName>,   I know If the Proper steps
were Taken Peace could be Restored in a few Days,   make Peace
with the <persName>Fredonian Party</persName> and the <persName>Indians </persName>will come into measurs,
But while Reports that are unfavourable are in sirculation  (that
are made by unprincipled <persName>Pearson </persName>on the <placeName>Aish Bau°</placeName>) the <persName>Freons </persName>(or
some of Them) try to steer up the <persName>Indians </persName>But Sir meake Peace
with the <persName>whits </persName>and the <persName>Reads </persName>will come in to measurs,   I heare you
Intend starting <placeName>home </placeName>in a few Days   Let Peace be Restored if Posible
Before you go;   If I could Do It with a Sertanty I could come and
Bring in 5 or 6 of the <persName>Party </persName>fine yong men&#8212;and as I stated before in
a former Letter, would be the means of Bringing the <persName>Party </persName>over&#8212;
and Peace that is so Disciable to a close    But the verry Idia of
<persName>Norris </persName>Being Restored and Remaining in office will be the means of
much Dissatisfaction and I feare for the consequence&#8212;Excuse the
Trouble I give you in so many Imperfect Scrolls,   let my feelings
towerds you as a friend and an old acquaintance, and my Love and
Desire for Peace be my Excuse, and as I heave Requested a <persName>Spaniard</persName>
to wait five minits, for These lins and he hurrys.   Pleas to Except
of my Best wishes for your Health and happiness   I am Dr. sir you
most</p>
