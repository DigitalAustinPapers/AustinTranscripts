<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]</p>

<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1833-08-21">Augt. 21. 1833</date>   Wednesday</p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>Yours of <date when="1833-07-13">13 July</date> came to hand <date when="1833-08-20">yesterday </date>via <placeName>vera cruz</placeName>&#8212;it was a
relief to me for I began to think the cholera had taken you off. I
recd the two letters of credit on <persName>E W Gregory</persName> of one thousand 
dollars and have not used them yet, but expect shall have to do it in
part, at least.</p>

<p>What are considered promonitory simptons of cholera gave me
warning since <date when="1833-08-12">monday of last week</date>. I was then much engaged in
trying to get the 11 article of the law of <date n="0406-1830">6 april</date> before <persName>congress </persName>in a
favorable shape and it was to have been sent in on <date when="1833-08-14">Wednesday</date>, but
the cholera prevented a meeting and has done so ever since on that
day I fatigued myself very much indeed. This brought my 
simptons to a crisis, for I was taken about 3 o'clock P. M. with excessive
purging of a whitish mucos character, great pain in bowels, cold
feet, legs, hands, etc, pains over the body&#8212;no cramps&#8212;moderate
vomiting&#8212;this was evidently the first stage of this desease and
would probably have passed into the collapse in a short time. It
was at this moment I closed a few lines to you by the last mail and
applied cholera remidy&#8212;in about 3/4 of an hour I was releived by a
fine perspiration which I think saved my life, for others have died in
less than one hour whose simptons were similar to mine. This
desease prostrates the strength to a most astonishing degree. I find
that I sensibly feel the effects of the billious attacks I have had in
<placeName>Texas </placeName>and the quantity of calomel etc I had to take&#8212;my stomach
is so debilitated that I have to diet with great caution to avoid a
relapse.</p>

<p>I think I shall go out <date when="1833-08-22">tomorrow </date>to <placeName>Tacubaya</placeName>&#8212;two leagues, where
<persName>Genl Mason</persName>&#8212;<persName>Butler </persName>and many others have retired some time since&#8212;<pb n="1000"/>
all kind of business is suspended. I must wait untill the cholera
subsides.   I fully believe that 11 article of law of <date when="1830-04-06">6 april 1830</date> will
be repealed in a few days after business is resumed again and the
state question I think will be placed on favorable grounds and will
also succeed&#8212;tho I may be deceived.</p>

<p><persName>Sterling Robinson [Robertson]</persName> has presented to the <persName>State Govt
</persName>a long memorial about his business in which there are depositions
taken before <persName>Chrisman </persName>to prove that he introduced a great number
of <persName>settlers </persName>which I took away from him etc. how he could get men to
state such falsehoods or <persName>agents </persName>to advocate and arrange them I am
at a loss to imagine&#8212;it has really surprised me&#8212;it seems that I
shall never learn to suspect mankind or to know, untill I am driven
into mysanth[r]opy.</p>

<p>As to the man you talked with at <placeName>Orleans </placeName>who said he would take
a different course and induce his <persName>brother </persName>to do so&#8212;I can only say
that God can certainly change the <persName>negro </persName>to a <persName>white man,</persName> but that is
a miracle not common in our days, what I mean is that envy,
jealoucy, malignity when once deeply fixed in the human heart and
fostered by boyish and silly vanity, are not easily rooted out, nor
easily controuled.</p>

<p><persName>The holders of <placeName>11 L. grants</placeName></persName> ask three four and even $10000 for
them&#8212;que tal&#8212;many of them will be lost for <date n="10-xx-1833">October </date>is the limit
for the locations. I am anxious to secure the<placeName> 11 L tract surveyed by
<persName>Brown </persName>east of colorado foot of mountains</placeName>, do not neglect this and
put it in the name of <persName>Jose Maria Aguirre</persName> in preference to the
others&#8212;attend to them all, I want that place to get out of trouble
for I mean to go and live there&#8212;it is out of the way and will do for
an <placeName>academy </placeName>scheme with which I can amuse myself and do good to
others. I have not seen <persName>Gen Mexia</persName> he is with <persName>Santana</persName>&#8212;<persName>Zavala </persName>is
at <placeName>Toluca</placeName>, has only been a few hours in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>since I arrived he
will be in after the cholera is over. <persName>Mexia </persName>is the most firm 
<persName>republican </persName>there is in this <placeName>country </placeName>and I believe one of the most honest
and best men in it&#8212;they are both <persName>friends </persName>of the state question. <persName>Don
Victor</persName> has been more bitter than anyone I have heard of&#8212;he is now
much softened down and is not a violent <persName>enemy</persName>. He is a decided
friend to the repeal of the <date when="1830-04-06">april law</date>.</p>

<p>Close all the important <placeName>colony </placeName>business as quick as possible, and
keep clear of <persName>speculators</persName>, they are <persName>friends </persName>just so long as is 
necessary to get a hold on one, by which ruin or disgrace can be brought
on and no longer&#8212;caution <persName>John </persName>against all <persName>speculators </persName>and take
care not to involve me or my name. I had rather herd with vermin
than with that class of human beings.    Write to <persName>Perry </persName>that I am<pb n="1001"/>
well&#8212;and think that I am cholera proof. I hope they may be fever
proof <date n="xx-xx-1833">this year</date>, but I tremble for them after the overflow&#8212;they
ought to go to <placeName>chocolate bayou</placeName>. No one writes to me. I know not
whether you are all dead or alive. I got one letter from <persName>John </persName>late
in <date n="06-xx-1833">June</date>&#8212;this is the only one&#8212;how is<persName> little Stephen</persName> and<persName> Henry
Austins family</persName> and my <persName>sister </persName>and how is <persName>Perry </persName>getting on at <placeName>peach
point </placeName>and a thousand things that someone might write me.</p>

<p>I hope <persName>Sarah </persName>and <persName>children </persName>are all well and all goes on harmoniously.
I shall spare no labor on this trip, for it is my last&#8212;others are
desirous to take the lead and I am quite anxious they should. I
confess that I am tired of abuse which I never have merrited, and
do what I may I expect nothing else from one set in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, tho
they are poor devils, unprincipled, brutal and ungenerous and 
ungrateful&#8212;with all the errors and infernal <persName>Spanish </persName>prejudices and
ignorance of these people, I cannot help but feel a great anxiety
for their welfare and prosperity&#8212;they wish to be free and to be
like the rest of the<placeName> civilized world </placeName>and I think it is more noble to
try and aid them and encourage, than to abuse and ridicule. Do try
and soften some of our <persName><hi rend="italic">rough boys</hi></persName> as to the <persName><placeName>Bexar </placeName>people</persName>. I assure
you that all <placeName>Texas </placeName>is greatly in debt to <placeName>Bexar </placeName>for the remonstrance
of <date when="1832-12-19">19 Decr last</date>&#8212;that paper was reprinted here and has had more
weight in favor of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, than all that has been done or said. I
doubt much whether the memorial of the convention would have
been even looked at, had not the minds of <persName>Govt</persName>, been prepared by
the<placeName> Bexar</placeName> representation. It came from <hi rend="italic"><persName>natives </persName></hi>and is believed. I
was fully aware of all this&#8212;an therefore wasted so much time and
pains to effect that object for which some of our <hi rend="italic">boys </hi>abused me&#8212;
vaya. I hope soon to be once far in beyond their reach&#8212;two trips
to <placeName>Bexar </placeName>in the dead of <date n="Winter-1832">winter </date>exposed to rain and <persName>Indians</persName>, and a
trip to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>all on my own expense, and get brutal slander for
pay&#8212;none but a fool, a poor devil wrould continue to serve people
who treated him in that way, or would suffer others to do it. I will
however do my duty and serve them faithfully, at the risk of life and
all I am worth. I have undertaken to do it and I will do it&#8212;but for
the future I will try and look to my own comfort a little more and
keep myself free from such enormous responsibilities which none
but an honest and liberal man can comprehend or appreciate. I
ought to despise my <persName>slanderers </persName>and do despise them, but it sours me
with human nature. I am too apt to run into extremes. I followed
conciliation to a great extreme from a sense of duty to the <persName>settlers</persName>&#8212;
and I am not in danger of falling into its opposite extremes.</p>
