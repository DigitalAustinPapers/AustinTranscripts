<p>[June &#8212;, 1824.]</p>
<p>I call you brothers because the <persName>chiefs of your <placeName>nation</placeName></persName> who came to
the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>about 3 Moons ago told the <persName>Americans </persName>who live there
that the <persName>Wecos </persName>and <persName>Tawakanes </persName>were <persName>friends </persName>and wished to be at
peace with them&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Americans </persName>and <persName>Wecos </persName>have always been <persName>friends </persName>and met and
parted like <persName>brothers </persName>and so they ought always to be&#8212;and so the
<persName>Americans </persName>always wish to be&#8212;but some bad men of the <persName>Wecos </persName>or
some of their <persName>friends </persName>last year spilt blood in the path which had 
before then been always clean, <persName>J. T.</persName> one of our people was murdered on
the <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName>by <persName>Indians </persName>who said they were <persName>Wecos</persName>&#8212;he was much
beloved by the <persName>Americans </persName>and they all cried out for revenge&#8212;and I
intended to have made a campain against your towns to revenge the
murder for the <persName>Americans </persName>will never suffer any of their people to be
killed or robbed without punishing the <persName>murderers </persName>or the robbers but
I heard of the words of your <persName>chiefs </persName>on the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, that they wished<pb n="845"/>
to be at peace with the <persName>Americans </persName>and would punish the <persName>murderers</persName>
of <persName>Tumlinson</persName>&#8212;I informed the <persName>Americans </persName>of these words and they
all said that the <persName>Wecos </persName>had always been their <persName>friends </persName>and that they
did not wish for war with them, but that the <persName>murderers </persName>of <persName>Tumlinson</persName>
must be punished and then they would be satisfied. I have therefore
sent up some young men to talk with you and to deliver you these
words from the <persName>Americans</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Americans </persName>will be at peace with the <persName>Wecos </persName>and <persName>Tawakanes</persName>
and trade with them as <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>brothers </persName>provided the <persName>chiefs </persName>of
that <placeName>nation </placeName>will agree to punish the <persName>murderers </persName>of <persName>Tumlinson</persName>. The
path between us shall then be clean and both <persName>parties </persName>can travel in
safety. The <persName>Wecos </persName>and <persName>Tawakanes </persName>must not disturb the <persName>settlers on
the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>or <placeName>Colorado</placeName></persName> and if any of those <persName>settlers </persName>misuse any of your
nation I will punish them for it if the chief will inform me and if
any of your nation steal from or misuse any of the <persName>Americans </persName>the
<persName>chief </persName>must deliver them to the <persName>Americans </persName>to be killed or whipped
according to the crime they have committed&#8212;in this way we may
keep a peace between us as long as the sun shall shine, All bad men
will then be punished and all the good ones can live in their <placeName>houses</placeName>
and <placeName>villages </placeName>with their <persName>women </persName>and <persName>children </persName>and plant their corn in
peace and safety. My <persName>friends </persName>the <persName>Americans </persName>are a great people they
are like the leaves on the trees&#8212;they are all good <persName>warriors</persName>&#8212;and well
armed&#8212;they are true <persName>friends </persName>and dangerous <persName>enemies </persName>they never
beg peace of any nation, they are always ready for war or peace,
but they prefer peace for they wish to be <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>brothers</persName>
with all the <persName>Indians of this <placeName>province</placeName></persName>, the <persName>Wecos </persName>and <persName>Tawakanes </persName>can
therefore chose and send me word by the young men what they 
intend, and whether they are willing to punish the <persName>murders </persName>of 
<persName>Tumlinson </persName>and be at peace with the <persName>Americans </persName>or whether they wish for
war&#8212;</p>

<p>[Endorsed:] Talk sent to the <persName>Weco Indians</persName> by <persName>Duke </persName>and <persName>Selkirk</persName></p>
