<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I have recd yours by <persName>T Collet</persName>&#8212;the Power of Attorney given me
to sell lots &amp;c is agreeably to your request herewith returned&#8212; I
should very willingly take the claim of 640 acres for Stock but I
have it not to spare&#8212; When I borrowed the 150$ from you I had
every assurance that men could give that I should have <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and
a much greater amnt before this time&#8212;I have been disappointed&#8212;
I have sent you enclosed a power of Attorney to sell <hi rend="italic">three Shares of
Bank Stock</hi>&#8212;Collet tells me it is worth 85. to go if so, <hi rend="italic">2 shares</hi> will
more than pay the 150.$ however raise the 150.$ out of the stock
if it takes <hi rend="italic">all three shares</hi> I depend on your getting the best price
you can for them&#8212; I have been greatly disappointed&#8212;perplexed and
delayed in my arrangements, but Shall be off I think on Sunday&#8212;
I do not wish you to purchase any more claims on our agreement
untill you hear from me after my arrival at <placeName>Red River</placeName>,-&#8212; the 
arrangement with <persName>Browne </persName>I suppose is only conditional, I shall try to
sell some claims for <hi rend="italic"><persName>Clark </persName></hi>when I arrive there and if a prise can be
had that will justify I will send up an express</p>

<p>My route will be from here to <placeName>Red River</placeName> by water, thence 
immediately after my arrival, to the <placeName>oucita </placeName>and <placeName>Arkansaw </placeName>by land and
through the country as occation may require&#8212; I wrote you some
time ago by <persName>Doctor R. Andrews</persName>, proposing to give him a share in
our <placeName>Washitaw </placeName>location on certain terms mentioned therein&#8212; on this
subject you can act as you think proper&#8212; if andrews could be 
appointed <persName>deputy Surveyor</persName> to lay off our tracts, it would be much to
our advantage-</p>

<p>have you heard anything from <persName>T. Rector</persName> since his return, or any
other person, wheither the country at the <placeName>Little Rock</placeName>, or on <placeName>washitaw</placeName>
<placeName>at the mouth of the Caddo</placeName> or on <placeName>Red River </placeName><placeName>at the mouth of Little
River</placeName> has been <hi rend="italic">surveyed</hi>, or wheither order of survey can be had for
our locations this point is material I would take the 640 acres for
Stock but my <persName>Father </persName>wishes to appropriate all the Stock he has to
discharge his Bank debt&#8212; After I arrive where I can get 
information that will be of use to us, you may expect to hear from me very
often&#8212; I regret much that it has been out of my power to send the
150.$, but, <hi rend="italic">so it is</hi>&#8212;- I am very much embarrased, as every cent I owe
in the Country must be paid before I can start&#8212; and I have now
nearly settled all my affairs&#8212; My bank debt will be arranged by my
father who has assured the payment of it, and when I start I shall
be able to go nearly <hi rend="italic">quite free</hi> the period of my return to this 
country is some what doubtfull, tho, probably in the <date n="Fall-1819">fall</date>&#8212;    however<pb n="343"/>
should I find it necessary to come up on our business I shall do so,
on this subject however I shall act as occation may require.</p>

<p>If you have an opportunity before Sunday morning write me, and
say what is the state of the <placeName>Bank</placeName>, have you heard from <persName>Price</persName>, have
[you] heard who are the <persName>officers of <placeName>Arkansaw Territory</placeName></persName>&#8212; what ammt
of claims have you purchased since I left you the payments and also
what prospect there is of getting an order of Survey&#8212;</p>

<p>Compliments to <persName>Mrs. Ohara</persName> and your <persName>Mother</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. William M Ohara</persName><placeName> St Louis</placeName></p>
