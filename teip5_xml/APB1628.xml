<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1828-10-25">Oct. 25. 1828</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Sister</persName></p>

<p>I rec.d your kind and affectionate letter the other day and sent it
down to <persName>Brother</persName>&#8212;he came up a few days since with his <persName>wife </persName>and
is now here&#8212;he informs me that he wrote you by way of <placeName>Orleans</placeName>
just before he left <placeName>home</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I truly sympathise with you on the loss of your <persName>infant</persName>&#8212;tho I have
seen so much trouble and misery amongst my fellow beings that I
doubt wheither we should too deeply grieve for the departure of
innocence and purity from this wretched world&#8212; There is another
and a better one, to doubt it would be to convert the shadows which
surround us in this life into the most horrible darkness</p>

<p>I send this by <persName>Mr Brown</persName> of <placeName>St Charles</placeName> and he has only a few
moments to wait being now on his way therefore cannot write you
a long letter. I wish you to inform me what plan you have adopted
or think of adopting as to <persName>Joel </persName>and <persName>Austin</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Brother </persName>is about engaging in the Mercantile business and I think
will soon be enabled to do an extensive and profitable one&#8212;</p>

<p>I am as yet at work at colonization and shall necessarily be tied
down here for some time to come&#8212;it is a troublesome business and re-<pb n="136"/>
quires much more preserverance and patience than any one can
imagine who has not tried it&#8212;   But I will go through with it&#8212;</p>

<p>You ask me how I like my <persName>sister in law</persName>&#8212; I am very well pleased
with her, and think <persName>Brown </persName>has made a happy choice&#8212; they live
very happily together and have the prospect of an heir this winter
or <date n="Spring - 1829">early in the spring</date>, tho I presume he has written you relative to
his family matters&#8212;</p>

<p>I wrote you to send me the <placeName>old Lead book</placeName> kept by <persName>Ballard </persName>during
the year I worked the <placeName>mines </placeName>in partnership with <persName>Butler</persName>. <persName>M.r Ballard
</persName>knows that nothing was cleared that year. I sent a statement of the
a/cs. to <persName>Butler</persName>, but he pretends to claim (as I am informed) Many
thousand Dollars I know not exactly what kind of a man <persName>Ballard</persName>
is but have always thought him an honest man and I do not think
he will forward <persName>Butler</persName>s unjust claims to injure me&#8212; I wish <persName>Mr
Perry</persName> to sound him as he may deem prudent on the subject&#8212; The
truth is that the <placeName>mines </placeName>cleared nothing the year <persName>Butler </persName>and myself
worked them in <persName>partnership </persName>and I therefore owe him nothing on
that score</p>

<p>This <placeName>country </placeName>has been very healthy this <date n="xx-xx-1828">year </date>and we are getting on
pritty well in every respect&#8212; I will pay you a visit some time but
cannot tell when, it shall be as soon as possible&#8212; I know you
cannot visit me and I do not wish you to take such a journey&#8212; It
is too long, and exposed to some dangers&#8212; Remember me 
affectionately to <persName>Mr Perry</persName> and all old <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>acquaintances</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>
<p>[Address:] <persName>Mrs Emily M. Perry </persName> <placeName> Potosi Missouri </placeName>  <persName>Mr J Brown</persName></p>
