<p><placeName>Nachitoches </placeName><date when="1821-07-04">July 4 1821</date></p>

<p><persName>Don Erasmo</persName> has just furnished me with another Copy of the
papers relative to the <placeName>grant</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Col Pitts</persName> has not time to waite or I would have it correctly 
translated&#8212; The following is a rough Translation of the order from
<persName>Arredondo to Martinez</persName>&#8212;x</p>

<p>"The <placeName>Supreme Cortes</placeName> of these provinces having deliberated on
the representation made to me in your official note of the <date when="1821-12-26">26 
December</date> No. Ill&#8212; I have just received their resolution with which I
have conformed it is as follows&#8212;</p>

<p>It is expedient to grant the permission which <persName>Moses Austin</persName> 
solicited to establish himself with <persName>three hundred families</persName> in the <placeName>Province
of Texas</placeName>, on the conditions specified in his memorial on this subject
which accompanied your official letter&#8212;provided that the following
conditions be complied with&#8212;</p>

<p>1st All who emigrate under this permission must be <persName>Catholics</persName>, or
agree to be so, before they remove&#8212;</p>

<p>2d They must take the oath of allegiance to be faithful to the <persName>King</persName>
and Constitution etc</p>

<p>3 They must be honest, industrious <persName>farmers </persName>and <persName>mechanics</persName>&#8212;and
the applicant <persName>M Austin,</persName> will be held responsible for their good 
conduct"&#8212; (This is the substance of <persName>Arredondo</persName>s order to <persName>Martinez</persName>)
" and you are directed to send this intelligence to the party 
interested by a confidential <persName>messenger</persName>.</p>

<p>Dated <placeName>Monterey </placeName><date when="1821-01-17">Jany 17 1821</date></p>

<p>Signd            <persName>Joaquin de Arredondo</persName> "</p>

<p>To the <persName>Govr of the Province of Texas</persName></p>

<p>The balance of the paper is an order from <persName>Martinez </persName>to <persName>Erasmo</persName>&#8212;
directing him to seek you and communicate this, and to inform you
also that by an ordinance of the <persName>King</persName>, and a decree of the <persName>Council
of the Oriental Provinces</persName>, a <persName>Port </persName>is ordered to be opened in the <placeName>Bay
of St Bernardo</placeName></p>

<p>You must try and get <persName>Col. Pitts</persName> the <persName>bearer </persName>of this to join, from
what I can learn he is a very respectable man&#8212;   I have told him you
would inform him as to the terms</p>
<p>Your <persName>Son</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
