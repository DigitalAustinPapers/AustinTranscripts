<p>Confidential	<placeName>Orozimbo </placeName><date when="1836-11-05">Nov 5th /36</date></p>
<p>My much esteemed Sir,</p>
<p>Through the channel of your <persName>Commissioners</persName>&#8212;and by my conversation
with you on the <date when="1836-11-02">2d. inst</date>. I have manifested to you the importance of my
visit to <placeName>Washington City</placeName>&#8212;to regulate the most effectual mode of 
terminating the <persName>Texian </persName>Question&#8212;and as time is passing without any definitive 
action&#8212;when it is most precious&#8212;I am desirous that you who are so deeply
interested in the welfare of this country&#8212;should expedite the final 
determination of this question&#8212;Using if you should deem it advisable the 
following reason&#8212;When the treaty of the <date when="1836-05-14">14th of May</date> was entered into, it
was based upon the principle that <placeName>Texas </placeName>should form an independent 
nation&#8212;and should acquire a legal existence by means of the 
acknowldgement of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;but as that basis has been changed by the recent 
declaration of the <persName>People of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> in favor of annexation to the <placeName>U. S. of the
North</placeName>&#8212;it appears to me that the question is much simplified by this 
declaration of the <persName>Texians</persName>&#8212;because in future&#8212;it will appertain to the <persName>cabinet
of <placeName>Washington</placeName></persName> to regulate this matter&#8212;and a definitive treaty as is 
desired&#8212; The mode of effecting this important object without loss of time<pb n="448"/>
is what I hope to attain by my conference with the <persName>cabinet at <placeName>Washington</placeName></persName>,
conciliating at the same time all interests. Convinced as I am that <placeName>Texas</placeName>
will never reunite with <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;I am desirous on my part to improve the
advantages which may offer, and avoid the sacrifices&#8212;which will occur&#8212;
should an imprudent attempt be made to reconquer this <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;which
has hitherto proved more detrimental&#8212;than beneficial&#8212;consequently 
reducing the <persName>Texian </persName>question to this single point the regulation of the limits
between the <placeName>U States</placeName> and <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, which you are aware has been pending
many years&#8212;and which may be fixed at the <placeName>Nueces</placeName>&#8212;at the <placeName>Bravo del Norte</placeName>
or any other <placeName>boundary </placeName>it may be decided on at <placeName>Washington</placeName>&#8212;thus avoiding
disagreeable discussions&#8212;which might delay the definite termination of
this question&#8212;or cause a difficulty between two friendly <placeName>Nations</placeName>&#8212; This
in substance is a plain safe and Speedy mode of terminating this important
matter&#8212;and as all are interested, it becomes necessary that you facilitate
my journey to <placeName>Washington </placeName>with the least possible delay</p>

<p>In regard to the stipulation in the secret treaty that my journey should
be direct to <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName>&#8212;there should be no surprise when the reasons are
known why I first go to <placeName>Washington City</placeName>&#8212;and in the event of sending by
way of the latter&#8212;I would desire that Messrs. <persName>Hockley</persName>, <persName>Patton </persName>and <persName>Bee</persName>
should accompany me&#8212;whom you can commission for that purpose should
it meet with your approbation&#8212;</p>

<p>I conclude by repeating to you what I have said in writing and verbally&#8212;
That my name already known to the world&#8212;shall not be tarnished by any
unworthy action; Gratitude is characteristic of me&#8212;and consequently you
will have nothing on your part to repent of&#8212;</p>

<p>To you&#8212;I owe my existence, and various other favors which are deeply
impressed on me&#8212;and which I will endeavor to reciprocate as they so
justly merit&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Anto L. de Santa Anna</persName></p>

<p>If you have no use for <persName>Genl Jackson</persName>s letter&#8212;I will thank you to return
it by <persName>Majr. Patten</persName>&#8212;</p>
