<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I arrived here <date when="1807-11-24">Tuesday after noon</date> and to my great 
disappointment found <persName>Mrs. Phelps</persName> had gone on the <date when="1807-11-23">day before</date>&#8212;Perhaps it is
all for the best, at any rate it is my duty to believe so&#8212;They were
comfortable and well and in a new kind of Boat, in which I am told
they can ascend the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. I hope it is true. Intend, early
in next week, to return to <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, by Land by way of the <placeName>red
Banks</placeName> to Lust Ferry and so home. I think that I shall arrive 
before them&#8212; Funk has not yet arrived tho, daily expected&#8212;I have
it in contemplation to purchase a <persName>negro wench</persName> about 15 years old,
<persName>Mr. Hunter</persName> thinks I can get her for $300.   You know there is no<pb n="143"/>
such thing as getting a <persName>servant </persName>of that kind in <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>if I should
purchase, I shall take your Shott and give orders for mine to be
delivered to you, when arrived here&#8212;as yet I can find no market for
Shott or Lead&#8212;I am told there is no difficulty in getting it carted
to <placeName>Lexington </placeName>for 3/ pr. cw. I shall send on your Lead by the first
waggon, if any offers before I leave this&#8212;if not, I shall leave 
directions with my Friend<persName> Gilley</persName>, to forward it on, as well as the 2000
of shott when it arrives&#8212;I find the mail goes only once a week to
<placeName>Lexington</placeName>, of course, I can't get a Letter from you after <date when="1807-11-29">to 
Morrow</date>&#8212;you will probably get another from me before I start&#8212;I 
order'd my Shott shipped to the care of <persName>Messrs. Bullets</persName>&#8212;I shall now
give them directions to deliver them and what Letters, etc may come
on to <persName>Mr. Gilley</persName>&#8212;who will advise you whenever they arrive&#8212;I 
presume you will return this way, I wish you therefore to bring with
you whatever Letters etc are for me&#8212;My best respects to <persName>Mrs Austin
</persName>and <persName>Mr. Carrs Family&#8212;</persName></p>
