<p>Sir, myself with many of my <placeName>neighbours</placeName>, are verry desirous of
getting some information from you, respecting your <placeName>country</placeName>; we
wish you to be verry minute in your description of the climate, soil,
and productions; also the seasons, wether they are in extremes, wet
or dry; the state of your market, and general prices of your produce,
and particularly if you grow wheat, and how many Bushels per acre,
we also wish to know the terms that we can purchase the land on, and
the extent of your <placeName>collony</placeName>, and wether some 40 or 50 <persName>family's </persName>would
be acceptable; we also wish to know the convenience of your <placeName>mill</placeName>
priveleges, and general extent of your water power; also the 
different kinds of wild animals, particularly if the wild horse and cattle
abound in such numbers as is reported here, and wether sheep are
healthy there, learn us the state of literature, the present state of
your government, and the disposition of the <persName>natives </persName>toward your
<placeName>colony</placeName>; also wether your <placeName>waters </placeName>abound with fish, oysters, clams, etc,
and their qualities, wether your climate agrees with the notheren

obtained there, and if not, where they can be on the best terms, finally,
we wish you to inform us of all the advantages, and disadvantages,
and future prospects attending your country, we have proposed 
sending two men as <persName>agents of our little <placeName>colony</placeName></persName>, to explore and make the

of your answer, we can judge wether it will Justify us to do so or not,
if so, please to propose the rout they had better take for safety,
economy, and expedition,</p>
