<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I received your letter of the <date when="1821-11-06">6th ult.</date> but too late to answer to meet
<persName>Mr Austin</persName> in <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>by the <date when="1821-11-28">28th</date>&#8212;as you desired&#8212;but hoping
it may reach him before he leaves I now write you&#8212;I was more than
pleased with the description you gave me of the <placeName>province of Texas</placeName>&#8212;.
and particularly that part contained in <placeName><persName>Mr Austin</persName>s Grant</placeName>&#8212; you have
not only enlisted me but my <persName>wife</persName>, she has given her perfect consent
for me to visit the country this <date n="Winter-1821">winter </date>and if I like to move to it as
soon as I can settle my business&#8212;</p>

<p>I expect<persName> Mr John Filhiol</persName> one of my <persName>wifes uncle</persName>s and myself will
probably set out in the month of <date n="01-xx-1822">January</date>&#8212;to take precisely the rout<pb n="439"/>
you took till we arrive at the contemplated <placeName>Town</placeName>&#8212;I wish you there-
for to give <persName>Mr Austin</persName> your opinion of me, and if you can prevail on
him to consider me one of his <persName>choice settlers</persName>&#8212;and in the first class of
Locations&#8212;when I come on I will bring all the documents to show
him, satisfactorily my claims to his friendship and confidence&#8212;I
shall expect to bring in <persName>family </persName>as follows&#8212;a <persName>wife </persName>and <persName>child </persName>(by the
By&#8212;I did not tell you what a fine Daughter I have&#8212;yes one that
shall make many a heart tremble in the <placeName>Province</placeName>) and between ten
and fifteen <persName>negro slaves</persName>&#8212;and if I like as well as I expect&#8212;I can bring
many worthy <persName>families </persName>from my native state <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> as soon
as I can get them word&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish a <placeName>Town lot</placeName>&#8212;and tract of Land near Town&#8212;as may be 
possible to obtain, on account of my profession which I shall wish to
follow&#8212;and a tract imbracing a good <placeName>mill seat</placeName> above whereon I will
build a set of <placeName>mills</placeName> immediately&#8212;if I move&#8212;to supply the Town with
materials for building&#8212;If a division of the Lands should take place
before I reach [there] Please prevail on <placeName>Mr Austin</placeName> to suffer you to
draw for me in Town and country agreeably to your and his 
judgment suitable <persName>Mr Gramont Filhiol</persName> as well as <persName>John </persName>will move if I like
when I come out&#8212;</p>

<p>I have written a few lines covering yours to <persName>Mr Austin</persName> have in
there referred him to you&#8212;<persName>Mr Ballou</persName> and <persName>Mr Lovelace</persName>&#8212;who is with
you&#8212;my wife [would be] rejoiced to remove with <persName>Mr Lovelaces
Family</persName>&#8212;If I could settle my business in time but I cannot as I have
to sell for him property before I move&#8212;</p>

<p>I continued the cause of <persName>Sutton </persName>against his <persName>wife </persName>till next court for
want of testimony for her I still hope I shall succeed in making her
innocent and his cruelty appear&#8212;and securing to her her dower in
her contract secured</p>

<p>My <persName>wife </persName>and the <persName>Mr Filhiol</persName>s send their respects to you&#8212;my 
<persName>Daughter Elisa</persName> would send hers but she does not speak quite well enough
being only two days old&#8212;she and <persName>mother </persName>are quite brave&#8212;and I
remain&#8212;healthy&#8212;chearfull and as usual your friend and Hble Svt</p>

<persName>Mr Austin</persName> at <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>&#8212;he is quite malencholy and has been for
some time back&#8212;perhaps he has repented&#8212;If so forgive him&#8212;He
