<p>Petition for Enlargement of<placeName> Washington County</placeName></p>

<p>[December, 1813 ?]</p>

<p>To the Honorable the <persName>Legislature of the <placeName>Territory of Missouri</placeName></persName> the
Memorial of the <persName>Inhabitants </persName>of that part of the late Township of
<placeName>Grand River</placeName> situated East of said River Humbly sheweth
that where as by the late Law establishing the <placeName>County of 
Washington</placeName> the said <persName>Inhabitants east of <placeName>Grand River</placeName></persName> are placed in a
situation truly disagreeable and distressing in many points of View
by beeing divided from the <placeName>settlement West of the said Grand River
</placeName>and left attached to the <placeName>County of Saint Geneveive</placeName>, they therefore
most humbly pray your Honorable body will cause the line of the
said <placeName>County of Washington</placeName> to be so altered as to include with in
said <placeName>County </placeName>all the <persName>Inhabitants </persName>settled on the <placeName>Waters of the said
Grand River</placeName> and on the <placeName>Waters of the tarre blue</placeName> Causing the line
of said <placeName>Washington County</placeName> to run on the dividing ridge between
the <placeName>Waters of the Plattin</placeName> and the said <placeName>Grand River </placeName>and also on the
dividing ridge between the Waters of the establishment <placeName>Creek </placeName>and
the said <placeName>tarre blue</placeName> and up said <placeName>ridge</placeName>, to, <placeName><persName>James Bryan</persName>s Saw mill</placeName> on
the said <placeName>tarre blue</placeName> from thence to the<placeName> headwaters of flatt Creek</placeName> to
unite with the line of <placeName>Washington County</placeName> as It now runs</p>

<p>In Justification of the alteration of said line of <placeName>Washington
County</placeName> as above designated, your <persName>petitioners </persName>state first that the 
<placeName>settlements east of said Grand River</placeName> do not amount to a sufficient 
Number to form a <placeName>Township </placeName>by which means many inconveniences will
Result in as much as Most of the transactions either directly or 
indirectly are connectly [connected] with the <persName>settlers on the <placeName>West bank
of the said Grand River</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>Second they do not furnish Numbers sufficient to forme a 
<persName>Company of Militia</persName> and by beeing attach'd to the <placeName>County of Saint
Geneveive</placeName> must be drawn manv miles to do militia Duty.</p>

<p>Third because a division of a <placeName>Settlement </placeName>so immediately Connected
by <persName>family </persName>and Interests is productive of real disadvantages to the
<persName>Inhabitants</persName>, that many Other disadvantages will result to said 
<persName>Inhabitants </persName>from a Continuation of said <placeName>County line</placeName> Wherefore your
<persName>Petitioners </persName>pray that your Honorable body will take into 
Consideration this memorial of the <persName>Inhabitants living on the <placeName>East bank
of Grand River</placeName></persName> and grant the prayer thereof and your petitioner
as in Duty will Ever pray.</p>
