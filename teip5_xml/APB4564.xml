<p><placeName>Bexar </placeName><date when="1833-05-06">May 6. 1833</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>We arrived at this place on the <date when="1833-04-29">29</date> having been detained by 
excessive rain, and high waters.</p>

<p><persName>Don Erasmo Seguin </persName>was absent at his <placeName>plantation </placeName>thirty miles
below this, where he arrived only a few days since from <placeName>Matamoras</placeName>.
I lost no time in sending for him, but the high waters prevented his
reaching here untill the <date when="1833-05-03">3d inst</date>. I communicated to him, his 
appointment as one of the mission to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and laid before him the
memorial, which was translated with the aid of <persName>Carbajal </persName>and
<persName>Balmaceda</persName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>principal citizens of this place</persName> have held meetings on the
evenings of the <date when="1833-05-03">3d</date>, <date when="1833-05-04">4th</date>, &amp; <date when="1833-05-05">5th instant</date> to discuss this subject At the
meeting on the<date when="1833-05-04"> 4th </date>it was decided that a memorial should be sent to
the <persName>state govt</persName>, asking for the removal of the <placeName>seat of government</placeName> from
<placeName>Monclova </placeName>to this place, <persName>Don Erasmo</persName> being the only one who was in
favor of memorializing the <persName>General Congress</persName> for the separation and<pb n="962"/>
<persName>State Govt</persName> A number of the others were in favor of saying to the
<persName>Legislature of <placeName>Coahuila and Texas</placeName></persName>, that if the <placeName>seat of Govt,</placeName> was not
removed to this place, <placeName>Texas </placeName>would then separate&#8212; This meeting
adjourned after 12 oclock at night, to meet the <date when="1833-05-05">next evening</date> At
the meeting <date when="1833-05-05">on the fifth</date> the only question to be decided was the
manner of memorializing the <persName>state Govt</persName> for a removal of the <placeName>seat of
Govt</placeName>, as had been agreed to on the <date when="1833-05-04">4th </date>the late law of the <persName>state 
legislature</persName> regulating the " right of petitioning" was examined, and
construed to mean that neither the <persName>Ayuntamiento </persName>nor the <persName>citizens</persName>
in mass could petition, and that the memorial must only be signed
by three persons at most in the name of the people This 
construction I contended was erroneous The law says that, none but the
<persName>supreme powers of the state</persName> can represent the will of the <placeName>people</placeName>,
and prohibits corporations or public meetings, or <persName>individuals </persName>from
taking it upon themselves to say what is the will of the people etc
(See the law in <persName>alcalde </persName>records) The true meaning of this is, as I
think, that no corporation or persons can petition in the name of the
people, without first consulting them, by calling them together 
However it was decided that the law prohibited the <persName>Ayto </persName>from 
petitioning or from calling the people together to petition, and that only
three persons could petition The next question was, who would do
it? Only one man (<persName>Balmaceda</persName>) was willing to sign as one of the
three, so that the meeting broke up without doing anything or coming
to any definitive conclusion I believe that if the <persName>state Govt</persName> is granted
the <placeName>people </placeName>here will be well satisfied, but I do not believe they will
take any part whatever in favor or against the measure. I 
considered it my duty to use every exertion to procure their co-operation,
and have done so. The most that can be expected is, that they will
not oppose it The fact is, that the movement <date n="Summer-1832">last summer</date> against
this place, from the <placeName>colony </placeName>has produced a much deeper impression
than I was aware of untill now it has neutralized many who before
that were openly warm <persName>friends </persName>and it has made some decided <persName>enemies</persName>
to the <persName>colonists</persName></p>

<p><persName>Don Erasmo Seguin</persName> cannot go on the mission, I am convinced that
no unfriendly feelings deter him&#8212;but his private affairs will not
permit his leaving <placeName>home</placeName>.</p>

<p>Nothing was done, of course, as to the appointment of another to
go in his place.</p>

<p>The reports about new disturbances in the <placeName>interior</placeName>, and that
<persName>Genl Filisola</persName> had returned with the <persName>troops </persName>that were ordered to
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, are all incorrect and unfounded The <persName>Genl </persName>arrived at 
<placeName>Matamoras </placeName>on the <date when="1833-04-24">24th ult°</date> as we learn by letters recd, here <date when="1833-05-05">last night</date>.</p>

<p><persName>Santa Anna was elected president</persName> and <persName>Gomez Farias vice president</persName> by large <persName>majorities </persName>and they have entered upon their respective
offices   All is quiet, so far as I can judge from <persName>Genl Filisola</persName>'s com-<pb n="963"/>
munications, and also from his general character I have confidence
that he will be the <persName>friend </persName>of liberal principles, and of <placeName>Texas </placeName>I leave
here <date when="1833-05-06">to-morrow</date> or <date when="1833-05-07">next day</date> for <placeName>Goliad </placeName>and thence to <placeName>Matamoras</placeName>,
and shall see the <persName>Genl </persName>as soon as possible The rains have been very
excessive in <placeName>this part of the country </placeName>and all travelling has been
suspended for the last week, but there is now a prospect of good
weather                </p>

<p>The <persName>legislature of the <placeName>state</placeName></persName> was to have adjourned on the <date when="1833-04-30">last day
of April</date>.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Sawyer</persName> arrived from <placeName>Monclova </placeName>a few days since and brings
information that <persName>Fisher </persName>was there on his way to <placeName>Matamoras </placeName>He
has been continued in the office of <persName>Collector of <placeName>Galveston</placeName></persName>, as I am
informed by <persName>Sawyer</persName>, who says that he speaks favourably of the
<persName>Colonists </persName>etc etc</p>

<p>I will endeavor to procure their co-operation at <placeName>Goliad </placeName>and write
from there</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>N. B. You must make up your mind to answer regularly the 
correspondence of the <persName>chief of Department</persName> or be fined and probably
totally ruined. You can at least acknowledge the receipt of his
official letters, even if it is in English.</p>

<p>To <persName>L. Lesassier Alcalde of <placeName>Austin</placeName></persName></p>
