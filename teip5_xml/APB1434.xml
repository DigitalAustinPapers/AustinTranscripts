<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1827-09-10">Sep 10th 1827</date></p>
<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>I have, for some weeks past, waited for some communication from
you, respecting by business, but my expectations have been 
disappointed, Your last letter found me on the eve of departure for the
<placeName>Bay</placeName>&#8212;and as you then mentioned your intention of immediately
returning to <placeName>San Felipe</placeName>, I thought it unnecessary to write.&#8212;Upon
my return to <placeName>Town</placeName>, I found you had prolonged your stay in <placeName>San
Antonio</placeName>, and as there was a pressure of other and important business,
I felt an unwillingness to obtrude my business upon your attention,
subsequent events increased that unwillingness, and I have waited
patiently untill the arrival of today's mail, in the hopes of your<pb n="1679"/>
informing me of at least the disposition of my papers&#8212;my entire
ignorance of their fate, induces me, to trouble you with the present
communication and the only apology I can offer, is the importance of
the business, to my future prospects&#8212;Your entire silence has
induced me to suppose, that my business may possibly trench too
much upon time, allready devoted to the welfare of <persName>individuals</persName>, who
have claims upon your attention, I can pretend to none&#8212;if my
supposition is correct, I can only express my regret that your 
politeness should have mislead me</p>

<p>It is still my intention to prosecute the business which brought me
to the <placeName>Country</placeName>, and in conformity with your advice I intend going
to the <placeName>City of Mexico</placeName> so soon as I can adjust some business in the
<placeName>United States</placeName>, whither I shall go during the present month&#8212;I was
and still am anxious to obtain the sanction of the <persName>state government
</persName>for my projected enterprise, and feel well assured that that sanction
would very much facilitate my business with the<persName> Genl Gov</persName>&#8212;If you
can do so without interfering too much with your business I should
feel myself much indebted to you if you would present my petition
to the consideration of the Govt at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and forward to me the
result at <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;directed to myself or <persName>Joseph B Wilkinson</persName> care of
<persName>Mr Poinsett</persName>&#8212;if however you should deem this course impolitic&#8212;or
too troublesome to yourself I beg that you will frely inform me so
any letter you address me will find me in <placeName>Neworleans </placeName>as late as the
<date when="1828-01-15">middle of January</date>.   Accept my good wishes for your safe return&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>C. B. Penrose</persName></p>

<p><persName>Col. S. F. Austin </persName><placeName>Saltillo</placeName></p>
