<p><placeName>Natchitoches </placeName><date when="1822-04-13">April 13 1822</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Friend</persName></p>

<p>I arrived here <date when="1822-04-12">last evening</date> all well have sent <placeName>Richmond </placeName>to <persName>Dr
Sibleye</persName> the steam boat will be here <date when="1822-04-14">tomorrow </date>or <date when="1822-04-14">next day</date> I find from
the <persName>Dr</persName> that the report I heard on the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>that <persName>Col Hawkins</persName>
was in <persName>Kinselow </persName>vessel was unfounded the <persName>Dr</persName> was lately in <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> and informs me he has writen to you since his return&#8212;If
I can dispose of my horses will return from here by water</p>

<p>I am requested to ask of you to enquire and ascertain whether any
of the <placeName>Mines of the Province</placeName> can be worked and on what terms the
<persName>gentleman </persName>informs me that he knows of one in the <persName>Indian nation</persName> the
<persName>commanche </persName>is extreemly rich not heretofore known and if 
permission can be got to work that he will make it known provided we
will make up a <persName>Company </persName>sufficient to carry it on and make him
interested&#8212; from his representation and the manner he is spoken of
by others it will be of importance and reliance can be placed in
him&#8212; as I progress and here the continued complaint of an intire
stagnation of business I feel more and more anxious for the 
termination of your journey and to get Information from you if
the government is settled and is disposed to give you that 
incouragement we expect think I will return in the <date n="Fall-1822">fall </date>or if you can
make any arrangements for <persName>mercantile business</persName> will immediately on
receiving the information from you make the necessary 
arrangements to carry it into efect&#8212; in fact I must find some thing to do
my present prospects are dull but according to the old addage it is
never so dark as before day&#8212; My respects to <persName>Brown </persName>and to <persName>Dr
Hewitson</persName></p>

<p><persName>Henry Elliott</persName></p>

<p>P. S. on my return to this place I saw <persName>Mr Castleman</persName> as there
appeared some uncertainty as to the result of your Journey he
wished me not to sell the land till I heard from him or you on
your return if incouragement is given to form the <placeName>settlement </placeName>he
wishes it sold and appropriated as you directed</p>

<p><persName>H E</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr Stephen F. Austin</persName> <placeName>St Antonia</placeName> Care of his
<persName>Brother </persName>who may open it.</p>
