<p>Memorandum [By Moses Austin.]                  <date when="1801-04-12">1801 April 12</date> Sunday</p>

<p>This Day about Ten in the Morning I left <placeName>St Geneveve </placeName>for <placeName>New
Orleans</placeName> with Two flatt Boats Loaded with sheet Lead and Shott&#8212;
at the <placeName>mouth of the Kaskaskea</placeName> I passed <placeName>Hog Island</placeName> to avoid Danger
its necessary for flatts to keep under the <placeName>American Shore</placeName> keeping
the <placeName>Island </placeName>to the Eight&#8212;in the <placeName>Bend of the Burnt Woods</placeName> on <placeName>Bois<pb n="70"/>
Brule</placeName> you pass an <placeName>Island </placeName>which you also keep on the Eight hand
keeping under the A[merican] shore some time above the Island to
avoid being Drawn in to the left by the Current&#8212;at the lower end of
the <placeName>Burnt Woods</placeName> you pass an <placeName>Island </placeName>called [undecipherable] keeping it
to the left&#8212;about Sundown I arrived at <placeName>Cape </placeName>five men which forms
a large Eddy below which is a good landing place for flatts on the
<placeName>Spanish Shore</placeName>&#8212;<date when="1801-04-13">Monday 13</date> about 8 O'Clk this morning I left <placeName>Cape</placeName>
five men the river is very good from this place until you come to
the <placeName>Grand Tower</placeName>, to pass this place with safety a <persName>Pilot </persName>is necessary
or a man that understands the place Its not Improble that this has
been a grand Barrer [barrier?] and that all the River above this
place to <placeName>St Louis</placeName> has formed a Large <placeName>Lake </placeName>the whole River is Drawn
to a pass of about 1/4 of a mile there is a Rock in the River at this
place about 100 feet in Diameter and sixty in Hight between which
and the shore the water passes with uncommon Rapidity with a Bluf
of Rocks on each [side] which appear to have formed a union at
some former period what makes this place Dangerous for flatts there
is an <placeName>Island </placeName>immediately below the <placeName>Grand Tower</placeName> which forms a
strong suck to the <placeName>American Shore</placeName> and unless a Boat is well man.d
and immediately hawls in under the <placeName>Spanish Shore</placeName> they may be
Drawn in to the left of the <placeName>Island </placeName>which is Rendered Dangerous by
the many Planters or Sawyers which are so strongly planted in the
sands with the small end up that if a Boat strikes one of them they
seldom escape&#8212;about five in the Evening I passed what the 
<persName>Americans </persName>call <placeName>Devils Island</placeName> it formes a strate reach in the River of about
three miles but is not Dangerous for flatts you keep under the 
<placeName>Spanish shore</placeName> above this <placeName>Island </placeName>leaving the <placeName>Island </placeName>on the left about

Berries ripe and gathered some of them this place is supposed to
be about <placeName>20 miles above the Walnutt Hills</placeName> the Moschettoes was so bad
this night that all the smoke we could make was of no acct.</p>

<p><date when="1801-04-28">Tuesday 28</date>&#8212;Morning C[l]oudy and still like for rain about 10
O Clock was boarded by two Canoes of <persName>Arkansaw Indians</persName> who had
three Barrells of flower on board taken up on the River lost by some
<placeName>Kentucky </placeName>Boats 8 of which these <persName>Indians </persName>informed us had been

Sunrise about 12 O clock pass.d a Strate in the River of about 1/4 Mile
on each side of which while our Boats was passing the <placeName>Banks </placeName>gave
way and with them a number of large Trees&#8212;pass.d an <persName>Indian
Hunting Party</persName>.</p>

<p><date when="1801-04-30">Thursday 30</date> Cloudy like for rain, about 10 O Clock a Barrell

of <placeName>Pits Burgh</placeName> took it in&#8212;it was Branded with <hi rend="italic">Frankford S. Tine (?)</hi>
by which I suppose it to belong to some of the <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>boats lost
in <date n="03-xx-1801">March </date>there was seen on the shores in Sundry places a number
of Barrells but the Wind together with the state of the River 
prevented us from Landing about 4 O Clock in the afternoon we pass.d
what is called the <placeName>Little Gulf</placeName> as also the <placeName>mouth of the Yazoo</placeName> this
place is about <placeName>four Miles or five above Walnutt Hills</placeName>&#8212;at which
place we arrived at Night.</p>

<p><date when="1801-05-01">Friday May 1</date> This Morning we pass'd the <placeName>Walnutt Hills</placeName>, its 
appearance from the River is truly Delightfull rising like an 
Amphitheatre one hill above an Other on the Commanding Higth stand [s]
the <placeName>Fort </placeName>which is Well built and Capable of being made a strong
<placeName>Fortres </placeName>there is about twelve Houses some of them have a good 
appearance, the whole face of the Hill is under improvement, and the
Corn at this time about up to your knees&#8212;there is not a Doubt but
this place will sooner or later make a large town its said to be <placeName>One
Hundred and Twenty Miles from Natcha</placeName> after leaveing the 
<placeName>Chickasaw Bluffs</placeName> you see no Highlands until you come to the <placeName>Walnutt Hills</placeName>
which I suppose to be not less than 400 Miles the River being high<pb n="74"/></p>

<p>it was but seldom we could bring our Boat to Dry land the whole
country being under water for Miles back in the woods and 
notwithstanding the lands on this River from the <placeName>Mouth of the Messura</placeName> to
this place are equal to any in the world in point of soil, yet there low
situation will render it impossible to settle them untill some way is
found to Bank out the overflowing of the <placeName>Mississippea </placeName>(that is 
<placeName>below the Ohio</placeName>) from the <placeName>Ohio </placeName>up the <placeName>Country </placeName>is generally high and its
only in places that it overflows its Banks&#8212;10 O Clock pass'd a large
sand Barr with near a mile of Driftwood on which we see <persName>Men </persName>
examining the Drift and Bends of the <placeName>River </placeName>for flower lost from the
<placeName>Kentucky </placeName>Boats 18 of which we were informed had been lost <placeName>above
Walnutt Hills</placeName> in <date n="03-xx-1801">March </date>and <date n="04-xx-1801">Early in April</date>&#8212;<placeName>25 Miles below 
Walnutt Hills</placeName> is a new <placeName>settlement </placeName>on the <placeName>American side of the River</placeName> of

stand Down the River untill 10 O Clock and about 12 O Clock come
to and passed the <placeName>Grand Gulf</placeName> this is a Dangerous passage for 
strangers the River is Drawn into a narrow pass at a point which forms
a <placeName>Rock Bluff</placeName> with two Counter Currents on each side of the River
leaveing a small Channel between the two. about the middle of the
River its necessary for Boats to put under good headway to pass this
place and to steer the Boat to the <placeName>Bluff </placeName>which will bring you in to
the Middle Current the Other two Running up the River with great
valocity and If your Boat is Drown into the left hand Current there
is Danger of being Dashed against the Rocks 3 weeks before I passed
the <placeName>Grand Gulf</placeName> a Boat from <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>with flower was Dashed
against the Rocks the Cargo and 3 men lost the River in Other 
respects is not bad about this place 4 O Clock the winde became so
high that we could not keep the River made a landing at a landing
place where stood a small Hous on the <placeName>Bank of the River</placeName> at this
<placeName>Hous </placeName>we found an <persName>old man</persName> liveing by himself he informed me he
had been a livin[g] 40 years in the <placeName>Natche Settlement</placeName> he appeard
to live by the Charity of the Boats</p>
