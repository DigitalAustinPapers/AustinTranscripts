<p><placeName>Brasoria </placeName><date when="1835-09-10">10 Sept 1835</date></p>
<p><persName>Mrs M A Holley</persName></p>
<p>My dear <persName>Sister</persName></p>

<p><persName>Stephen </persName>has at last arrived. I rode all night through the swamp and rain
to meet him at <placeName><persName>Perry</persName>s</placeName> His arrival unites all <persName>parties</persName>&#8212;We, the <persName>Republicans</persName><pb n="120"/>
have striven hard to keep all quiet until his arrival with certain intelligence
of the movements and intentions of the <persName>Mexican Govt</persName> and thanks be to God
have succeeded with the exception of a few acts of the <persName>War party</persName>, not 
compromising the whole people&#8212;</p>

<p>Now we meet on middle grounds. Strict Republican Principles&#8212;That
is, to stand upon our constitutional and vested rights&#8212;reject the 
Centralismo Plan if offered to us and if they send a <persName>force </persName>to fight us to repell
force by force&#8212;</p>

<p>United we have nothing to fear If compelled to take arms in defence
of our Republican and Natural rights, Republican institutions and 
principles against despotism&#8212;That Just, Holy and Omnipotent Judge who ever
decides in favor of the rightious cause, will be our sword and our shield
and The <persName>Texians </persName>will be as safe as the <persName>Israelites </persName>in the land of the 
<placeName>Philistines</placeName></p>

<p>With such a cause we shall Command the Sympathies of our <persName>Republican
friends in the <placeName>North</placeName></persName> and of the <persName>friends of freedom throughout the <placeName>World</placeName>
</persName>Should <persName>Santa Anna</persName> march against us with the <persName>Mexican army</persName>&#8212;the 
<persName>Republicans in the <placeName>South</placeName></persName> will rise and make a diversion in our favor
a Grand Dinner and Ball were got up for the occasion on two days notice
in a Manner very creditable to the <persName>Committee </persName>and port&#8212;the only thing- I
did not like was 7$ a head for ball and supper and 30 more for a decent suit
of clothes which I had not and could have done without There were 60
covers and despite the short notice the table was three times filled by men
alone In the evening the long room was filled to a Jam at least <persName>60 or 80
ladies</persName> who danced the sun up and the <persName>Oyster Creek girls</persName> would not have
quit then had not the room been wanted for breakfast&#8212;you never saw
such enthusiasm</p>

<p><persName>Mrs. Phelps</persName> is here with <persName>Almira </persName>and the <persName>two Miss Munsons</persName>, they go
home today&#8212;<persName>Stephen </persName>left last night to be at <placeName>S Felipe</placeName> on the <date when="1835-09-12">12th </date>when all
the upper world is to be there, I stay to correct the proof sheets of the
address and then go to <placeName>St Felipe</placeName> to close our land business&#8212;within a
year <placeName>every league</placeName> will be worth 40,000$&#8212;I will write the <persName>girls </persName>from home
Perhaps in time for this Packet Fathers blessing upon his children and
<persName>Sister</persName></p>

<p>Your <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>Say to my dear <persName>daughters </persName>I found their affectionate letters here on my
return from <placeName><persName>Perry</persName>s</placeName>, have had scarcely time to read, much less answer them.
I shall get part of my crop off for<placeName> N Orleans</placeName> within six weeks, I order
the product to you except so much as may be indispensable to my own
wants, at present I have not enough money to buy a good horse and no one
sells on credit<pb n="121"/></p>

<p>With this you ought to receive the handbill and <placeName>newspapers </placeName>giving all
particulars</p>

<p>dont send the guns to <persName>Tailer</persName></p>
