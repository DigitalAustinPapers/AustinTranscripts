<p><placeName>Gonzales </placeName><date when="1835-11-03">Nov 3d 1835</date></p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>As <persName>secretary of the Committee of safety for this <placeName>municipality</placeName></persName> I have to
address you upon a matter revolting to the feelings of <persName>every American</persName> not
destitute of every moral principle. <date when="1835-11-02">Yesterday </date>the <persName>troops from Ayish
Bayou</persName> arrived in <placeName>this place</placeName>, in consequence of the Boat being turned over
to be put in a situation for service, the <persName>Troops </persName>were compelled to remain
untill <date when="1835-11-03">this morning</date>. <date when="1835-11-02">Last night</date> a scene such as in all probability never
was exhibited in any <placeName>civilized country</placeName> presented itself to us&#8212; Upon the
<persName>Army</persName>s leaving this place not more than <persName>12 Men</persName> and 3 or 4 guns were left
most of the men were <persName>invalids</persName>, the balance of the population composed of
<persName>women </persName>(whose <persName>Husbands </persName>are in the <persName>Army</persName>) and <persName>children</persName>, those <persName>men </persName>(The
<placeName>Ayish Bayou</placeName>) entered <placeName>private Houses</placeName>, compelled <persName>women </persName>to leave their
<placeName>House </placeName>with their <persName>Children </persName>and seek protection from their <persName>neighbours</persName>,
Broke open doors. Robbed of Money clothing and every thing they could
lay their hands on and dragged <persName>Dr Smithers </persName>from his bed and would have
murdered him, but for the interferance of some one of the <persName>company </persName>who
possessed some little more of the milk of human kindness than the 
balance&#8212; I am directed by the <persName>Committee </persName>to ask for a <persName>detachment of 20 men
from the Main Army</persName> to protect this place and to assist in sustaining the
forces as they come on <persName>Capt Johnson</persName>, <persName>English </persName>and <persName>Sublet </persName>can in all 
probabily give information as to the <persName>ringleaders </persName>in this Matter&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jno Fisher Sec Com Safty <placeName>Gonzales</placeName></persName></p>

<p>N B The <persName>families of this place</persName> unless protected, are determined to risk
the <persName>Indians</persName>, rather than such men as represented above, some of whom<pb n="234"/>
seem determined to remove at once, rather than risk the passing of the
reinforcement coming on	<persName>Jno F</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Genl Stephen F Austin Commander in Chief of the Texas
forces</persName> <placeName>Mission St Juan</placeName></p>
