<p><persName>Mr E. K. Weightman</persName>,</p>

<p>Sir, Should you wish to commense work before my return you
will call on <persName>Mr Williams</persName> for the <placeName>plots </placeName>of the Surveying done by
<persName>Borden </persName><placeName>on the waters of San Jacinto</placeName>, so as to connect your work
with his&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish you to commense <placeName>at the mouth of the west fork a short
distance above the Tuscasito road</placeName> and work <placeName>up the west side of
the Main San Jacinto and on all the creeks that discharge into it
on the west side</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I do not know where each of the <persName>families </persName>are who have entered
land in that quarter and you will call on <persName>Williams </persName>for a list of
them taken from the register and survey land for them all, they
paying you the Surveying fees or arrangeing them to your 
satisfaction, and also you can survey for all who have certificates of 
reception but for no others&#8212;</p>

<p>You will be guided by the printed regulations issued by the 
<persName>Commissioner Juan Antonio Padilla</persName>&#8212; Be carefull to regulate your
chain and Compass agreeably to the Standard heretofore used in
this <placeName>Colony </placeName>as directed in Said printed regulations.</p>

<p>You will make your returns and a general connected plot of
your work as soon as possible, and write the name, in pencil, of
the applicant for each tract, on the tract on the Genl. plot.</p>

<p>Take especial care not to leave any vacancies or irregular Slips
between tracts, Should it be absolutely necessary to leave any
<placeName>vacant land</placeName> let it be in the <placeName>middle of some prairie,</placeName> where there is
neither water nor timber, that is, land which is of no use at all
for pasture or anything else&#8212;</p>

<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1830-04-07">7 April 1830</date></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>A <placeName>tract </placeName>was granted to <persName>David Harris </persName><placeName>on the west side of San
Jacinto</placeName>, and you will connect your work with the upper line of
that tract, I believe that line has never been run and you will
therefore run it. The lines of this tract as discribed in the deed
of concessions are as follows&#8212;   " <placeName>Begining at the mouth of the<pb n="367"/>
West fork of San Jacinto</placeName> at a post from which a hickory bears
ÜT. 40 W 10 bars marked D. H. and a sicomore bears S. 50 W 8 bars
Marked D. H. <placeName>thence west 5850 varas</placeName>, t<placeName>hence south 5000</placeName> vs. <placeName>thence
east 3265 vs to the river</placeName>&#8212;"</p>

<p>The <placeName>upper corner of this tract is at the fork which enters San
Jacinto a short distance above the Tuscasite road</placeName> before mentioned&#8212;•
Say about a Mile or there abouts.</p>

<p><persName>Frederick Rankin</persName> can shew you the corner as it is only a short
distance above where he first settled at the <placeName>Tuscasite road</placeName>, and
your best way is to go from here direct to his <placeName>home </placeName>where he now
lives in what they call <placeName>" New Kentucky "</placeName>&#8212; This corner will be
your begining place, and from there work up as before Stated&#8212;
I wish you to finish all that <placeName>country </placeName>including all the branches
and creeks <placeName>west of the main San Jacinto up to its head</placeName>, as soon
as possible for I wish all the returns by the <date when="1830-05-15">Middle of May</date> at
Most&#8212;</p>
