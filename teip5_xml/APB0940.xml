there is no prospect that Either will be primarily Elected. <persName>Genl
Jackson</persName> now appears to run Ahead, but the <persName>House of Representatives</persName>
Vote by <placeName>States </placeName>in that case the result may be different, in <placeName>New York
</placeName>we hear that <persName>Jackson </persName>had 29 and <persName>Clay </persName>7&#8212; this State will give 
<persName>Jackson </persName>3 and <persName>Adams </persName>2. the Ballotings were <persName>Jackson </persName>30 and <persName>Clay </persName>29.
three <persName>senators </persName>were absent friendly to <persName>Clay </persName><persName>Dominique Boliney

<persName>Governor </persName><persName>Genl Thomas</persName> and <persName>Harper </persName>had a few votes. <persName>Mr. 
Livingston</persName> was not put up Some think he is kept Back to go into the
New <persName>Cabinet</persName>, most probably in place of <persName>J. Q. Adams</persName>.&#8212; <placeName>The Great
National Canal from Potomac to Monongehala</placeName> will now certainly
go on, the <persName>Commissioners </persName>have reported in favour of it, on the
summit Level water to feed the <placeName>Locks </placeName>at all seasons will be found
in abundance&#8212; The whol of our New State Loan has been taken by
an <persName>English Company</persName> at five pr cent it will soon go into operation.&#8212;</p>

<p>We have had no deaths but <persName>Davenport </persName>lately that I Recollect.
<placeName>Red River</placeName> is so high and rising that Steam Boats will be looked for
Next-Week.&#8212; The crop of cotton will exceed that of the last or
any former year. Corn is scarce, all Other Provisions plenty and
cheap&#8212; The Country is healthy and slowly improving.-&#8212; If <persName>Mr.
Smyth</persName> is in you quarter Please to present to him my best wishes. I
hope his health is improved It is a pity a Man of his Sterling
worth should be so afflicted by Physical infirmity&#8212;- Present my
compliments Likewise to <persName>Mr. Cook</persName>, the ebolutions of <persName>Mr. Holtham</persName>
Ought to give him no uneasiness, it certainly will do him no harm
Amongst those who know him, as well as his adversary. I have a
great desire to See your Country, but whether or not I shall be
able to do so, the prosperity of your settlemt has my warmest
Wishes. The papers will inform you of the Political State of
<placeName>Europe</placeName>, The <persName>Duke D'Artoi of <placeName>France</placeName></persName> Succeeds <persName>Louis 18</persName> and will be
called <persName>Charles the tenth</persName>, he is sixty five; without issue, and was a
<persName>libertine</persName>, till his Constitution Obliged him to be Otherwise.&#8212; I
wrote you lately on the Subject of the Late <persName>Doctor Robinson</persName>s 
Account with the <persName>Mexican Government</persName> I hope you will be able to 
procure for his Amiable <persName>Widow </persName>a Satisfactory Account of the matter.&#8212;
You will oblige me If you will inform me wheather the <persName>officers </persName>and
Men who served under <persName>Bernardo Gutieras</persName> and <persName>Toledo </persName>will be allowed
the Land promised them, or Any other compensation Many of thos
Claims might be Bought up on Reasonable terms.&#8212;</p>
