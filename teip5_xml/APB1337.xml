<p><placeName>Station on the Labaca</placeName> <date when="1827-02-27">26th febuary 1827</date></p>
<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>I am sorry to be the herrold of bad news&#8212;<persName>Baptist Lacount</persName> came
here <date when="1827-02-25">2 days since</date> who states that a very large band of <persName>Comanches</persName>,
and <persName>Weehoes</persName>, had attacked <persName>Cahoe</persName>'s party of the <persName>lepans</persName>, and nearly
all the <persName>tonkowas</persName>, on the <placeName>San Marcos rio</placeName> <placeName>about 9 miles above the Town
of Gonzalez</placeName>&#8212;that the <persName>lepans </persName>and <persName>tonkowas </persName>were whiped with the
loss of 5 or 600 horses, and that they retreated <placeName>down the river</placeName>&#8212;some
of them (the <persName>lepans</persName>) are now at <placeName>Delions</placeName>&#8212;the <placeName>fort at Gonzales </placeName>was
not finished, and what few men was there were in greate danger&#8212;
some of them talke'd of leaving the place, another defeat in 
attempting to settle the <placeName>Sn Marks</placeName> if not already, will soon take place.</p>

<p>Inclosed you will have some certificates&#8212;I have call'd on the <placeName>Colo</placeName>,
to make out certificates relative to . . . guns, and those that were in
his charg, but [he has] not done so.<pb n="1608"/></p>

<p>The <persName>people </persName>here seeme industrious, and are useing much exertions
to plant corn etc they are all in good health. They are anxious that
the <placeName>Colo</placeName>, should appoint some person as an <persName>agent </persName>in fact to manage
his business------think of this------and perhaps you had better write to
him&#8212;</p>

<p>We have had a great [d]eal of rain; so much that we can not plant:</p>

<p><persName>James Kerr</persName></p>

<p>Note   Please write to me by the first opportunity</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo S. Austin</persName><placeName> San felipe de Austin</placeName> Care of <persName>Major
Philips </persName><placeName>Colorado</placeName></p>

<p><date when="1827-02-26">26th February</date> <persName>Capt Lockhart</persName> has just came from <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>and
[states] that, he quit surveying and joined the <persName>settlers </persName>and assisted in
building the <placeName>fort</placeName>&#8212;that they resolved to keep the place etc and that
they [are] planting corn there. Be will return <date when="1827-02-27">tomorrow</date>. Could a
small piece of arteary [artillery] be obtained from the Govt, it
would no doubt be of great utility to that place&#8212;would be glad if
you would mention this to <persName>His Excellency the Chief of the 
Department</persName>.</p>
