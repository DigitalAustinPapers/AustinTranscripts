<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir You have herewith a publication made by the <persName>Mexican
Minister</persName> at <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, which has gone forth in a great many <placeName>papers</placeName>
printed in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, this publication has created a belief
in the minds of many <persName>thousands </persName>that all<persName> North Americans</persName> are 
prohibited from going to <placeName>Texas </placeName>to Settle, and is calculated to do your
<placeName>Colony </placeName>verry great injury, I feel verry certain that <persName>Col Tornel</persName> did
not mean this prohibition to extend to any <placeName>grants </placeName>which stood on
the same grounds yours does, and so I have Explained his meaning
to all who have called on me&#8212;<pb n="550"/></p>

<p>I am under the impression that it would be well for you to 
publish in the <placeName>Texas Gazette</placeName> under your Signature as <persName>Empresario </persName>a full
explanation, send it to me and it shall go into the <placeName>News papers of
this Country</placeName>&#8212; Unless the prohibitory Idea is explained it will
prevent <persName>thousands </persName>from Emigrating this <date n="Winter-1830">Winter </date>and <date n="Spring-1831">Spring </date>that
have intended doing so until they saw or heard of this publication</p>

<p>[Inclosure]</p>

<p>MEXICAN LEGATION IN THE <placeName>UNITED STATES</placeName>.</p>

<p>Having received information that several offers have been made to <persName>citizens
of the <placeName>U. States</placeName></persName> to colonize the <placeName>lands in the State of Coahuila and Texas</placeName>, I
consider it my duty to caution them by publishing the 11th Art. of the law
of the <date when="1830-04-06">6th of April of 1830</date>, which is as follows :-&#8212;</p>

<p>"Art. 11. In virtue of the authority which has been reserved by the <persName>General
Congress</persName> to itself, by Art. 7th of the law of the <date when="1824-08-18">18th of August of 1824</date>, all
<persName>foreigners</persName>, whose <placeName>country </placeName>is bounding on said <placeName>State and Territory of the
Federation</placeName>, shall be prohibited from settling within the said <placeName>State or 
Territory</placeName>, in consequence of which all the contracts that have not taken effect,
and are opposd to this law, shall be suspended."</p>

<p>Wherefore, I declare, in the name of the <persName>Mexican Government</persName>, that 
whatever contract shall have been made in violation of the said law, will be null
and void, it being understood that colonization in the <placeName>State of Coahuila
and Texas</placeName>, and the <placeName>territory of New Mexico</placeName>, by <persName>citizens of the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>,
has been prohibited.</p>

<p><persName>Jose M Tornel</persName></p>
