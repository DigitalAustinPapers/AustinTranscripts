<p>Copy to <persName>W. C. Carr<</persName>/p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Since my last, which I beleive was in <date n="10-xx-1828">October</date>, I have had a final
settlement of accounts with <persName>A. Butler</persName> and have paid him upwards
of two thousand dollars, and arranged the balance in three 
payments in <date n="xx-xx-1831">1831</date>. <date n="xx-xx-1832">32</date>. and <date n="xx-xx-1833">33</date>.&#8212; The interest was all exacted to a cent
and in some instances compounded, which has caused the debt to
accumulate very much. I still owe considerably over four 
thousand dollars on it&#8212; this has been a cruel affair and has harrassed
me very much, more than any event of my life ever did, I hope
it is done with&#8212; Enclosed I send you an order to the <persName>clerk of
<placeName>Jefferson county</placeName></persName> to enter satisfaction on the judgement against
<persName>Bryan </persName>and My <persName>Father </persName>which I wish done, provided it cannot in any
manner be construed as implicating me, by construction, as having
assumed the payment of debts generally due by <persName>Bryan </persName>and My
<persName>Father </persName>unless where I am individually bound as was the case in
this debt&#8212;</p>

<p>The prospects of this <placeName>country </placeName>are brightening very rapidly and
<persName>emigrants </persName>of the most respectable character are flocking to it.</p>

<p>Perseverance and time have removed the obstacles that impeded
the settlement of <placeName>Texas </placeName>when I commenced. It was then a total
<placeName>wilderness</placeName>, destitute of resources, infested by hostile <persName>Indians </persName>and
without an organised Government and the real value of the 
<placeName>Country </placeName>unknown, or very generally doubted. When I look back at the
substantial impediments, that were calculated to retard or totally<pb n="178"/>
defeat my progress in planting a new <placeName>settlement </placeName>in this <placeName>wilderness</placeName>,
I find abundant cause of surprise that it should have advanced at
all. I was of the opinion that perseverance and time would 
surmount them. The event proves that I was right&#8212;A few more years
and the prosperity of <placeName>Texas </placeName>will astonish many. I am bold to say,
that as a <placeName>Country</placeName>, taken in the general average, it is unequaled by
any portion of <placeName>North America</placeName>. You will recollect that I have had
<hi rend="italic">some opportunity </hi>of forming an opinion on this matter, for I have
seen this <placeName>continent </placeName><placeName>from Connecticut to the City of Mexico</placeName>, and
have generally been a close observer of localities, soil, climate, etc.
Apart from the peculiar value of the <placeName>Mississippi river</placeName> and the
<placeName>harbors</placeName>, I deem <placeName>Texas </placeName>to be of more intrinsic value as a <placeName>country</placeName>,
than all the<placeName> States of Louisiana</placeName> <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName>Alabama </placeName>and <placeName>Georgia</placeName>
and the <placeName>territories of Florida </placeName>and <placeName>Arkansas</placeName></p>

<p>Our Govt gets on very well, <hi rend="italic">All things considered</hi> the federal
system was an experiment and a very dangerous one for <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
because their former habits and ideas as to political subjects, had
not prepaired the <persName>people </persName>for such a System, there must be some
collisions for a while, but good will grow out of them; for they tend
to elicit discussion and to diffuse knowledge. I may perhaps at some
leisure time write you a long and rather speculative letter on the
formation, progress and probable future advancement of this new
born <placeName>republic</placeName>, and notice some variations from their Model the
<placeName>U. S</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>This day belongs, most emphatically, to the history of <placeName>North
America</placeName>, I may indeed say to the history of the <placeName>civilized world</placeName>&#8212;the
<date when="1828-03-04">4 of March</date>, the inauguration of the <persName>President </persName>of a <placeName>republic </placeName>whose
comercial ramifications have penitrated every <placeName>inhabitable corner of
the Globe</placeName>, and whose moral influence has cheered every heart that
loves freedom, and thrown a gloom around the thrones of despotism.</p>

<persName>Jackson </persName>goes into office with the advantage of an overwhelming
<persName>majority</persName>, and should his <persName>cabinet </persName>possess talents and <hi rend="italic">" Management"</hi>
to retain their popularity he cannot fail to get through hapily and
prosperously&#8212; I am of opinion that his <persName>administration </persName>will in the
general be very popular, and very advantageous to the <placeName>nation</placeName>, for
I think that the experiments which have been made of the Tariff
Systim has clearly demonstrated the course that ought to be adopted,
and I think it will be adopted&#8212;Popular opinion will give this 
administration <hi rend="italic">all the credit</hi>, altho they may be governed by lights elicited
by others&#8212;I have taken no great interest in the election, tho I have
no objection to see <persName>Jackson President</persName>&#8212;Your Govt is founded on the
popular will&#8212;and agreeably to the principles on which it is based,
whatever the people will, <hi rend="italic">is right</hi><pb n="179"/>

<p>I recd your kind letter of <date when="1828-11-08">8 novr </date><date when="1829-03-03">yesterday </date>and thank you for the
sentiments it contains&#8212; the dificulty I mentioned in a former letter
is all settled whether it will ever occur again I know not&#8212;</p>

<p>Please remember me very particularly to your <persName>daughters</persName>. <persName>Ann
Maria</persName> I expect will hardly recollect me. I do " long " to see you all
and to see <placeName>Missouri </placeName>once more, and I <hi rend="italic">will </hi>see you as soon as I can
arrange my affairs to leave this <placeName>country </placeName>so as to be absent one year&#8212;
when you go to <placeName>Potosi </placeName>remember me to them all there.</p>

<p><persName>Brother James</persName> has a <persName>son </persName>a few weeks since, he lives at a new <placeName>town</placeName>
we have laid off on the <placeName>Brasos river</placeName> <placeName>15 miles from its mouth</placeName> called
<hi rend="italic"><placeName>Brasoria</placeName></hi>, a name which I gave it for the single reason that I know
of none like it in the world. I shall remove below myself as soon
as I can get a divorce from colonizing perplexities, and I do assure
you <hi rend="italic">they are many</hi>&#8212;I am weary of them, a <placeName>Small farm</placeName> a moderate
independence and a <persName>wife </persName>would render my life much happier than
it is or has been lately&#8212;but I am too poor as yet (as to active capital)
to think of those matters&#8212; <persName>Brother </persName>has denounced me as an old
bachelor confirmed and hopeless and has undertaken to fit up a
fruit garden for me to growl away old age in. I shall disapoint
him I hope tho am in favor of the fruit and therefore remind you
of your promise to send seeds and roots to <persName>Mr. Cox</persName> of<placeName> N. Orleans</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
