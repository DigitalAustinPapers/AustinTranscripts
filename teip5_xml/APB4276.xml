<p><placeName>Bolivar </placeName><date when="1831-11-15">15. Novr 1831</date></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>My last advices of <persName>Mr Mason</persName> left him at <placeName>Louisvill </placeName>waiting for
the sickly season to pass away&#8212;<persName> Mrs. Holley</persName> now informs me
that he had taken passage in the Spica, giving out that he was coming
here to settle the<persName> Hawkins</persName> business with you After embarking, a
letter was shown him from <persName>young Hawkins</persName> stating that you were
packing up for <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;<persName>Mrs. H </persName>told him she had letters from you
and myself both stating the time of your departure to be <date when="1831-12-01">1 
December</date>, He thought <persName>Hawkins </persName>account to be more to be relied upon and
as his sole business in <placeName>Texas </placeName>was to see you, wisely left the Spica
and embarked for <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> <hi rend="italic">to meet you in <placeName>Mexico </placeName></hi>He is not
the <persName>Mason </persName>who was in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>with <persName>Poinset </persName>never was in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
and does not speak Spanish, so you can judge of the probable result
of his mission at all events the affair is hung up as relates to us for
the present&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mrs Holleys friends</persName> would not consent to her leaving them until
spring&#8212; her purpose therefore is to return and compleat her 
engagement and as she loses 100$ pr month during her absence is
impatient to return yet is unwilling to do so without visiting <placeName>St.
Filipe</placeName> and seeing you&#8212; She is now here and I would hazard the
journey with her on horseback but for the expectation of the 
immediate arrival of My <persName>Family</persName>&#8212; They left<placeName> N York</placeName> in the Nelson to
sail <date when="1831-10-20">20th of last month</date>, I shall go to <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>tomorrow and will
endeavour to induce <persName>John </persName>to take her and his <persName>wife </persName>in <persName>Walter</persName>s 
Carriage as he proposed when I was last there, if that fails I will try
to get <persName>Mr Perry </persName>who I expect here <date when="1831-11-16">tomorrow </date>to let me have his
Carriage for the purpose&#8212; She has brought money to build her
<placeName>house </placeName>and stock her farm 900$ and appears decided to vest all her
interests in the <placeName>colony</placeName>, I shall however vest her funds in cows and
calves for the present   If you think it propper to admit her location<pb n="703"/>
and give her a passport of absence to settle her affairs. She will 
without doubt return in time and occupy her <placeName>land </placeName>altho some what
alarmed at the occupations of <persName>Phelps</persName> place, fearing She might be
served the same way if detained by sickness of her <persName>children </persName>or other
insuperable cause&#8212; she wrote you from <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, but does not
expect an answer whilst you continue feeble&#8212;I am glad to hear you
are able to walk about the room and hope you may be speedily
restord I shall come to <placeName>St Felepe</placeName> so soon as my <persName>family </persName>are housed&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Archebald </persName>appears decided to come out so soon as he can realise
his real Estate which ought to yield 2 or 3000$&#8212;with that I am
[sure] he could do better here than there</p>
