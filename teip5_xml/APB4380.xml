<p><persName>Colonel Mexia</persName> delivered to me your communication of the 7th
inst, with a copy of the articles of agreement entered into between
yourself and that <persName>Officer</persName>.</p>

<p>You request me "to acquaint <persName>Colonel Mexia</persName> with the actual state
of the insurrection in the <placeName>colonies</placeName>, and to consult with him as to
the means of restoreing peace and public order in view of the 
preservation of the integrity of the <placeName>Mexican Territory</placeName>&#8212;the most 
important subject that can claim our attention under the Circumstances"</p>

<p>I must in the first place say to you that I am a<persName> Mexican Citizen
</persName>and will with the most scrupulous fidelity, comply with my duty as
such and as<persName> Colonel of the Battalion of Civil Militia of the 
Department of <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName>, and if it becomes necessary will cheerfully sacrifice
my life in defence of the constitution and rights of the State and
<placeName>nation</placeName>, to which I have the honor of belonging. <persName>Señor Mexia</persName> has
officially invited me to accompany him. In compliance to the 
communication of <persName>His late Excellency the Commanding General, Don
Manuel de Mier y Teran </persName>bearing date <date when="1832-06-25">25 the ult</date>, your letter, and
<persName>Señor Mexia</persName>'s invitation, I shall accompany that Gentleman to
<placeName>Texas </placeName>although a sea voyage is very injurious to my health, owing
to sea sickness which acts severely on me.</p>

<p>I beg to be allowed to correct a natural error, resulting from an
imperfect knowledge of the State of affairs in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and the 
honorable character of its <persName>inhabitants</persName>, There is no insurrection of the
<persName>Colonists </persName>against the Constitution and Government, neither do they
entertain ideas endangering even remotely the integrity of the 
<placeName>territory</placeName>. No portion of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>have committed any insults
against the <persName>Mexican </persName>flag, nor will they do so.<pb n="816"/></p>

<p>It is necessary to take a retrospective view to understand the
cause of the evils that originated the disturbances at <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>.
The arrest of the <persName>Commissioner of the State of Coahuila and Texas,
Don Francisco Madero</persName> by <persName>Colonel Davis Bradburn, Commander of
<placeName>Anahuac</placeName></persName>&#8212; The suspension by military orders of the 
<persName>Constitutional Ayuntamiento of Liberty</persName>&#8212;the creation of the 
<persName>Ayuntamiento of Anahuac</persName> by the same power without the authorization or
knowledge of the only Government lawfully competent to do so,
The <placeName>State of Coahuila and Texas</placeName>. The arbitrary arrest and 
expulsion of several<persName> honorable citizens</persName>, by<persName> Colonel Davis Bradburn</persName>&#8212;-
The arbitrary intervention of that <persName>Officer </persName>in preventing an 
organization of a company of militia by the <persName>Ayuntamiento of Anahuac</persName>, and
the arrest of said <persName>Officers </persName>of said company and finally numberless
acts of despotism perpetrated by that <persName>military Commander</persName> have
caused the <persName>people on the <placeName>Trinity </placeName></persName>to believe with reason that there
were no constitution, laws, or guaranty for the protection of person
or property in that section, save the law of might.</p>

<p>The <persName>Government of the State</persName> did not resist <persName>Colonel Bradburn</persName>s
bold measures as it should have done, and therefore the unfortunate
<persName>inhabitants </persName>sank into despair, and I suppose pronounced 
themselves in favor of <persName>Santa Ana</persName> whose avowed object is the reign of
the <persName>Government </persName>and not that of whim and personal caprice. 
Consequently if there is an insurrection among the <persName>colonists </persName>it is for
supporting the constitution and the honor of the <persName>Mexican </persName>flag, and
not for attacking them.</p>

<p>It has been said that the <persName>Colonists </persName>have insulted the <persName>Mexican</persName>
flag; I dare answer that it is false; those who have trampled upon
the constitution, Laws, and guaranties under the authority of that
honored flag are the ones to bear the reproach of the insult, and not
the <persName>Mexican citizens</persName> who resisted such abuses of power.</p>

<p>All that has been said in regard to dangers for the integrity of
the <placeName>Territory of Texas</placeName>, is a mere tale, which serves in ruining the
progress of that unhappy <placeName>Territory</placeName>, by creating prejudice amongst
the <persName>Mexicans</persName>, and disgust among the <persName>Colonists</persName>, thus disturbing 
public peace.</p>

<p>No man who is acquainted with <placeName>Texas </placeName>will say or think that it ought
to secede from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, supposing that it were in its power so to do
I am well aware as to what is the true interest of that <placeName>country</placeName>, and
know the opinion of the <persName>people </persName>and therefore I say, that were the
<persName>Government </persName>to declare that <placeName>Texas </placeName>was fiee to secede or not. The
answer of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>would be, "Let the Constitution of the
<placeName>nation </placeName>and <placeName>State </placeName>be observed, and we will never consent to such a secession."</p>

<p>I beg to insist on this point in order to enable you to make a 
distinction between a lawful opposition to infractions of the Constitu-<pb n="817"/>
tion, and opposition to the <persName>Government</persName>, dangerous to the integrity
of the <placeName>territory</placeName>. Then you will no longer entertain the doubts, and
erroneous ideas expressed in your above mentioned communication,
and the unjust and fatal habit of criminating the <persName>Colonists </persName>in 
general, as has been done heretofore will cease. In every population
there are idle <persName>talkers</persName>, <persName>drunkards</persName>, and <persName>fools</persName>: is it just or politic on
the part of the rulers to denounce the mass because there are some of
that kind ? Is it just or politic to irritate the wise portion of the 
<placeName>community </placeName>by insulting treatment, and to attribute to them criminal
ideas which they do not nor never did entertain,</p>

<p>I proceed to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, not indeed, for preserving the integrity of the
<placeName>territory </placeName>which is not endangered, but to do every thing in
my power to calm the exasperation, which undoubtedly existed on
both sides, and that may lead to dangerous extremities, I wish to save
<persName>Davis Bradburn</persName> if he has not already perished and I will also
interpose all my personal and official influence to uphold the dignity
and constitution of the <placeName>State of Texas and Coahuila </placeName>against the
attacks of the military power, and against whomsoever has insulted
it or should attempt to do so.</p>

<p>On these terms I will act. I have expressed some time since, in
writing these sentiments to <persName>Colonel Ugartachea</persName> and His <persName>Excellency
the Governor of the State</persName>, and hope that a feeling of justice and a
desire to throw light on the subject will induce you to transmit a
copy of your letter to me, and of this answer to the <persName>Supreme Power
of the <placeName>Nation </placeName></persName> and of the <placeName>State of Coahuila and Texas,</placeName> at the same
time that you will give your instructions in consequence to the
<persName>commander at Anahuac</persName>. It is, then, understood that we will be
guided in our operations by the Constitution and lights of the
<placeName>State</placeName>, and not by Martial Law that the irritation shall be calmed
and the past forgotten, without compelling the <persName>Inhabitants </persName>to make
public declarations in their defence or against any person. Finally
let the balsam of harmony be poured on all the wounds.</p>

<p>God and Liberty.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin.</persName></p>
