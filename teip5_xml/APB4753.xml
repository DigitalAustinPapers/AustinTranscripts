<p><persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p>Aware of the great anxiety of yourself and <persName>family </persName>respecting our friend
<persName>Col Austin</persName>, I write you a few lines to inform you that I have by this mail
recd. a letter from him dated <placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1835-03-14">14th March</date>, in which he says he is
well that his matters have not changed any and that he is still waiting an
amnesty law, and believes he shall so remain the <date n="03-xx-1835">whole of that month</date> at
least.</p>

<p>Not hearing from him for three mails (between this and <placeName>Mexico </placeName>the mails
are weekly) myself and <persName>Companions </persName>had flattered ourselves with the hope
that he was on his road <placeName>home</placeName>, because he expected to be released so as to
leave there about the <date when="1835-03-01">first of March</date>, and besides a Gentleman here received
a letter dated late in <date n="02-xx-1835">February </date>from <persName>Mr. Parrot</persName> in which he says "by
<persName>Col Austin</persName> who will leave in a few days for <placeName>Texas </placeName>I will send you etc"
You may therefore judge our mortification on receiving information of
his still being detained aund under that chilling expectation of tomorrow
and after tomorrow. I must say that indignation was the predominant
feeling with me at what I conceive a tantalising persecution&#8212; I waited
upon the <persName>Govr</persName> made known to him the situation of my <persName>friend </persName>and strongly
urged him to represent to the <persName>Genl. Govt</persName>. in his behalf. I am happy to
say he promised to do so and authorised me to say to the <persName>Col.</persName> that he
would do so by the next mail. I also expect to be able to obtain a
representation from the <persName>Congress of the State</persName> on the same head.</p>

<p>The <persName>Col.</persName> complains of old <persName>Butler</persName> being his <persName>enemy</persName>. I hope we may
have the <persName>old dog</persName> in <placeName>Texas </placeName>some day&#8212;and give him his due reward in these
matters. I have not time to give you a detail of the news, and must
therefore refer you to <persName>McKinney</persName>. <persName>Chambers </persName>is here, and if I do not lay
him flat upon his back, it shall not be for the want of trial and I think I.
have the infidel on the hip.<pb n="59"/></p>

<p>Present me kindly to <persName>Mrs. Perry</persName> and the <persName>boys </persName><persName>Mr. Pilgrim</persName> etc. and
believe me your friend etc</p>

<p><persName>Samuel M. Williams</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName> <placeName>Gulf Prairie</placeName></p>
