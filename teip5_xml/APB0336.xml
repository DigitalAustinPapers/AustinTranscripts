<p>Sir</p>

<p>After Due Respect to you and family I Desire to Communicate
to you our Sittuation at present, our Salt buisness is going on 
Tollerable well at present. We have got a quantity of good brick on the
way and as soon as they Can be burnt I will have the furnace Rebuilt
then I think we can make upwards of one hundred Bushels pr week.
I have Bought <persName>Mrs Hemphell</persName>s Boat and have sent round to <persName>Vaughan</persName>s
one hundred and seventy Bushels of Salt which I think there will be a
Ready Sale for, but Let us be Carefull to git Lease as soon as it Can
be obtained for I think from what <persName>Mr McGuire</persName> tells me there will
be a Lease applied for soon he has been vewing the sittuation and I
expect has been sent for that purpose, he tels me that a part of my
place is Covered with a <placeName>New Madred Claim</placeName> Laid by <persName>Capt Spriggs</persName>
and others in partnership, though fortunately by not knowing the
Course of the <placeName>Caddo </placeName>he does not hurt me Verrey much   I think when<pb n="346"/>
he has it surveyed it will take in perhaps four or five acres of my 
improvement there intention is to Lay of a <placeName>Town </placeName>on my place or
<persName>Barkman</persName>s it will take all <placeName><persName>Barkman</persName>s improvement</placeName> and on the
Track there is not a Sittuation that will do for a Town. I want you
to Lay on your Six hundred and forty acre Claim for me and in my
name Beginning on the <placeName>West Boundary Line of Capt. Spriggs 
Location</placeName> and Running <placeName>up the Caddo 320 poles</placeName> to a point on the same
and thence Southerly at Right angles for the Compliment of Six
hundred and forty acres all on the <placeName>South Side of the Caddo</placeName> which
will enclude<placeName> <persName>Brayham</persName>s place</placeName> <placeName><persName>Richards Barkman</persName>s Little field</placeName> and the
<placeName>Still House</placeName> we can Settle with <persName>Barkman </persName>and <persName>Graham </persName>and make
our Division so as to suit our Selves almost all the County wishes a
Town where we had a thought of Laying one off and it is generally
Said that the Seat of Justice for this County will be on that place
as to my opinion there is no doubt of it I have not a doubt of your
attention for my Interest as well as your own, I heard from the
<persName>Mount </persName>the other day the <persName>Boys </persName>are all doing good business both
here and their   their Respects to you&#8212;</p>
