Request. I have Read and examined the Coloniel Decrees I think them
good for which myself and my <persName>neighbours </persName>give you our thanks&#8212;
May the Lord direct us to administer them properly&#8212;</p>

<p>a few days past there Came into our <placeName>Neighborhood </placeName>about 180
<persName>Waycoes </persName>and <persName>Tawacanies </persName>they first Came to <persName>Judge Rabbs</persName> where
they showed no acts of violence the <persName>Judge </persName>was in the act of starting
to the <placeName>Cane Brake</placeName> with his <persName>family</persName>, had his Horses packed when the
<persName>Indians </persName>who thought that the <persName>familys </persName>was alarmed at their Comming
and made the <persName>Judge </persName>with their <persName>families </persName>go back to his <placeName>Home </placeName>again
and helped to unpack his horses&#8212;the <persName>Indians </persName>then observed that
they did not Come to scear the <persName>Americans </persName>from their <placeName>Houses </placeName>but
wanted to be friendly with them, but was at war with the 
<persName>Tonkeways </persName>and was then on the hunt of them&#8212;next day the[y] came to
<persName>Mr Williams</persName> where <persName>Capt. Ross</persName> with 12 or 15 men met them friendly
held a Talk with them they professed every act of friendship 
possible towards the <persName>Americans</persName>&#8212;there was a Beef Killed for them and
as much Corn given as the[y] would Receive .the <persName>Chief of those
Indians</persName> asked <persName>Capt. Ross</persName> for a paper or Recommendation which he
gave him some time before they left <persName>Mr Williams</persName>, but being disturbed
at the time did not give such a one as he thinks now they deserved
the <persName>Chief </persName>says he will see you before Long and hold a talk with you
<persName>Capt. Ross</persName> says he wants you to take that paper from them and give
them such a one as you think proper&#8212;</p>
