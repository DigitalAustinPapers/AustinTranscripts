<p><placeName>Philada</placeName>.<date when="1795-05-11"> May 11th. 1795</date></p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you a few days ago by <persName>Mr Judd</persName>, a Gentleman of <placeName>New
England</placeName> who is going to <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and intends visiting the <placeName>Lead
Mines</placeName> in order to take a view of that part of the country, if he
should arrive there I shall be glad you will shew him any civility
in your power.</p>

<p>I have since received a letter from <persName>Mr Stephen Austin</persName>, wherein
he mentions that he was in treaty with a Gentleman for the 
disposal of a part of the <placeName>lead Mines</placeName>, who will be able to bring out two
or <persName>three Hundred Men</persName>, bred to the Mining Business and is very 
desirous that I will send him accurate plans of the lands I have taken
up in the <placeName>neighbourhood of the Mines</placeName>, as he thinks it will operate as
a considrable inducement to the men to come out when they find
that there is plenty of land for them to settle upon, near at hand, I
mentioned in my letter by <persName>Mr Judd</persName> that I had not yet received the
office Receipt for the <persName>20,000 Acres</persName> which you was to return for me
as soon as you got to the Mines, nor have I recd the annual acct. it
will also be necessary for me to have the plots of the prior surveys
in order to enable me to compleat the plan which I intend sending
to <persName>Mr Stephen Austin</persName>, it is of great importance to forward these
to him as speedily as possible in order that he may be able to make
the proper use of them before he leaves <placeName>England</placeName>. He desires me to
write to you on this subject, and to press the business forward in
order that the patents may be obtained as speedily as possible.</p>

<p><persName>Thos Huston</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. Moses Austin</persName> <placeName>Lead Mines Wythe County Virginia</placeName></p>
