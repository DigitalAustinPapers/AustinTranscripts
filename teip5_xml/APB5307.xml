<p><placeName>Columbia </placeName><date when="1836-11-19">Novr. 19. 1836</date></p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Your letter of <date when="1836-10-14">October 14th</date> was delivered to me by <persName>Cap. Henry Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>President <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi></persName> laid the papers relative to the two loans 
negotiated in <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> <date n="WInter-1835">last winter</date> by <persName>Archer</persName>, <persName>Wharton </persName>and <persName>Myself </persName>before
<persName>Congress </persName>and I have delayed answering your letter untill some definite
action took place on the subject&#8212;</p>

<p>There is a determination to act in the most liberal manner towards the
<persName>lenders</persName>. This <persName>Govt</persName>, have already manifested their liberality by agreeing
to give a <hi rend="italic">bonus </hi>of <placeName>thirty leagues</placeName> to settle this matter finally on the basis of
a relinquishment by the <persName>lenders </persName>of the right of priority in locating. And
it was and still is considered that the arrangement made with <persName>Mr Triplett</persName>
was definitive and clearly relinquished all right of priority in the 
locations&#8212; The <persName>lenders </persName>understand the matter differently and thus it remains
suspended</p>

<p>There has been no bad faith on the part of the <persName>Commissioners </persName>who 
negotiated that loan, nor on the part of the <persName>Govt. of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>&#8212;On the contrary this
<persName>Govt </persName>has manifested its desire to satisfy the <persName>lenders </persName>by allowing them t<placeName>hirty
leagues of land</placeName> for the relinquishment of a condition that is really not
worth the third of that bonus, but which the <persName>Govt</persName>, found it inexpedient to
comply with.</p>

<p>The <persName>lenders </persName>would make more money by taking the bonus, than they
could do by the original contract&#8212;</p>

<p>I have no doubt this <persName>Govt</persName>, would fund the debt, so far as paid in, and
issue certificates of Stock at a high interest&#8212;say twelve per cent, in order
to close the matter The annexation to the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> I think is <hi rend="italic">very certain</hi> and
then twelve pr. cent Stock would be very valuable.</p>

<p>I think that if an <persName><hi rend="italic">authorized agent</hi> of the lenders</persName> were to be sent here,
this matter could be satisfactorily arranged and definitively settled on an
equitable basis and to the satisfaction of the <persName>lenders</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I assure you, that on my part, every thing will be done that is consistent
with my duty&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Messrs <persName>Thos. O. Meux</persName> <persName>Jas. W. Breedlove</persName> and <persName>Alfred Penn</persName></p>
