<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1833-10-23">23 October 1833</date>.</p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>It gives me much pleasure to inform you that the decree repealing
the 11 article of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6 April 1830</date> passed the <persName>chamber of
deputies</persName> <date when="1833-10-24">yesterday </date>almost unanimously, and was discussed today in
the <persName>senate </persName>and two articles were approved (there are three articles
in the decree) when the <persName>senate </persName>adjourned. There was strong 
opposition in the <persName>senate </persName>on the ground that the <persName>Govt, of the <placeName>U. S</placeName>.</persName> would
take <placeName>Texas </placeName>if any more were alowed to come in from that <placeName>nation </placeName>and
many other very foolish and absurd objections, but the majority were
in favor of the law and I am told there is no doubt the other article
will pass <date when="1833-10-24">tomorrow</date></p>

<p><persName>Genl. Santana</persName> is expected in the <placeName>city </placeName>in <date when="1833-10-26">three days</date> and after he
arrives I will try (a final tryal) on the <placeName>state </placeName>question. I told the
<persName>vice President</persName> the other day that <placeName>Texas </placeName>must be made a <placeName>state </placeName>by the
<persName>Govt</persName>, or she would make herself one. This he took as a threat and
became very much enraged&#8212;however when he understood that my
object was only to state a positive fact which it was my duty to
state, he was reconciled. I had told him and the <persName>ministers </persName>the same
thing ever since I came here. The fact is this <persName>govt</persName>, ought to make
a <placeName>state of Texas</placeName>, or transfer her to the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> without delay and
there is some probability at this time that one or the other will be
done. A short time now will determine this matter in some way No
one writes to me from <placeName>Texas </placeName>I hope you have taken 
possession of all my papers desk etc that is if it be true as reported here
that <persName>Williams </persName>is dead, which I hope to God is not the case. I left
blanks signed to close the <placeName>coast colony</placeName> and should they fall into bad
hands an improper use might be made of them&#8212; take possession of
them all&#8212;</p>

<p>I have had to draw on <placeName>Orleans </placeName>for one thousand dollars. This
trip will cost me very dear, but I care nothing about that if either of
the two events above mentioned can take place, or if any good results
to <placeName>Texas </placeName>and its <persName>inhabitants</persName>&#8212; all my desires and ambition are limited
to the sole object of benefiting that <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;tho I must confess that
some of the <persName>good folks</persName> there irritate me very much sometimes with
their personal animosities and jealousies&#8212;but it is of short duration.<pb n="1009"/></p>

<p>Love to my beloved <persName>Sister </persName>and all the <persName>children </persName>and to your
<persName>neighbors</persName></p>

<p>Your <persName>brother</persName>                         <persName>S</persName>_______</p>

<p>I have written every mail since my arrival here on the <date when="1833-07-18">18 July</date>&#8212;
[Addressed:]  <persName>Mr. James F. Perry    Merchant </persName>   <placeName>San Felipe de
Austin   Texas</placeName></p>
