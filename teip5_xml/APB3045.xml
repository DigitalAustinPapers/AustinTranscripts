<p><placeName>Near Russellville Logan County Kentucky</placeName></p>

<p><date when="1825-12-25">Decr. 25&#8212;1825</date></p>
<p><persName>Stephen F Austin Esqr.</persName></p>

<p>Sir I have the honour of addressing you via <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>, in behalf of myself and sundry <persName>friends </persName>who, wish me to explore the
<placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>, and particularly that part of it comprehended
in your <placeName>grant</placeName>&#8212; I was on <placeName>Red River</placeName><date n="11-xx-1825"> last month</date>, and should have
proceeded to <placeName>your Section of the Country</placeName>, but I was advised to
postpone that part of my journey, till the grass grows up in the
<date n="Spring - 1826">Spring</date>, and having some <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>relations </persName>in this <placeName>quarter </placeName>who
desired to see me in relation to that <placeName>Country</placeName>, I came hither, and am
litterally locked up, for the <date n="Winter - 1825">winter </date>I suppose, by the ice and snow&#8212;</p>

<p>I have resided for some years past in the States of <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>
and <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, where the most of my <persName>friends </persName>abide, and at whose
instance I consented to visit your <placeName>Province</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I am instructed to enquire particularly into the following
points&#8212;to wit</p>

<p>1st Will there be allowed to the <persName>citizens</persName>, or <persName>Subjects</persName> of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, a
free commercial intercourse with the <persName>Citizens</persName> or <persName>Subjects</persName> of <placeName>other
nations</placeName> ?</p>

<p>2d Will Religious toleration be allowed the <persName>Emigrants</persName> from the
<placeName>United States</placeName>, so far as to be exempted from the payment of tithes
to the <persName>established Church,</persName> if they should desire it. And to think
and act for themselves in matters of conscience? Provided they do
not interfere with the Catholic Religion, and with fidelity support
the laws of the land, as <persName>citizens </persName>ought to do? and thereby to enjoy
as much Religious liberty as the <persName>Protestants</persName> have in <placeName>France</placeName>, and <pb n="1243"/>
some other <placeName>Catholic Countries</placeName>? Or as the <persName>Catholics</persName> have in the
<placeName>United States</placeName>? Or should these previleges in there full extent be
refused, we ask for the Privilege of exercising the rights of private
judgement in our own <placeName>houses </placeName>and <placeName>neighbourhood</placeName>? Provided,
nevertheless, that our difference in opinion with the <persName>Catholics</persName>, be a
silent one ?</p>

<p>3d We wish you to transcribe the form of the oath you will administer to us&#8212;From your letters which we have seen in print, we know
your terms of settlement, and are satisfied&#8212; Have the goodness to
write me as soon as convenient, after the receipt of this, and very
particularly on each of the forgoing points, addressed to me at this
place</p>

<p>I expect to remain here till next <date n="05-xx-1826">May</date>, and will thank you for any
news which you maye please to give me&#8212;                    <p><persName>John Smith</persName></p></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Stephen F Austin Esquire</persName> <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;Particular care
of the <persName>Post Master of <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName></persName>&#8212;</p>
