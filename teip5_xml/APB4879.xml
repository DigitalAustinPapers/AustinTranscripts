<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName>, <date when="1835-09-21">Sept. 21st. 1835.</date></p>
<p><persName>Gentlemen</persName>&#8212;</p>
<p>I received the information last night of the <persName>expedition </persName>that is raising to
march on to <placeName>Labacca </placeName>and without delay have sent <persName>expresses </persName>to <placeName>Harrisburg</placeName>,
<placeName>Trinity </placeName>and the <placeName>upper country</placeName> with copies of the paper which I enclose for
your information&#8212; <persName>Frank Johnson</persName> starts <date when="1835-09-22">tomorrow </date>for <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>; I
have requested them in that <placeName>quarter </placeName>to raise all the men they can and march
on without delay. There must now be no half way measures&#8212; War in
full&#8212; The sword is drawn and the scabbard must be put on one side
until the <persName>military </persName>are all driven out of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. I presume you have received
the <placeName>circular </placeName>from the <persName>committee of this place</persName> dated the <date when="1835-09-19">19th inst</date>.; <persName>Mr. 
Brigham</persName> took it down&#8212; it was written in consequence of information received
from <placeName>Bexar </placeName>which was of so decisive a character that the <persName>committee </persName>deemed
it a duty to take a clear and [un]equivocal position at once and to let the
<persName>country </persName>know its opinion&#8212; I am happy to say that in <placeName>this quarter </placeName>and in
the <placeName>upper country</placeName> so far as I have heard, all are united and all for <hi rend="italic">War</hi>;
I hope you will inform me of what is done so that there may be as much
concert as possible, you will see by the enclosed paper, that a <persName>corps of
reserve</persName> is proposed. This was done because I expect, that some will come
on from <placeName>Trinity </placeName>and some from <placeName>Bevil' settlement</placeName> who cannot be in time for
the advance, and it was necessary to give them some center to report to, so
as to receive direction and organization; until there is some <hi rend="italic">head </hi>to order;
we must all try to labour in concert, so as to support each others movements
as much as the distance and circumstances will permit. I will remain here
for a while, or go on to <placeName>Labacca </placeName>as may be deemed most advisable. I seek
no command and wish none, but am ready to do all the good I can to
unite opinions and raise <persName>men</persName>, and to fight in person&#8212; I go into this war
cheerfully and with very different feelings from what I had in any of our
past difficulties&#8212; we are now <hi rend="italic">right </hi>our basis is sound and just, and will<pb n="131"/>
be so declared by an impartial world; we are defending our constitutional
rights against <persName>military </persName>usurpation&#8212;</p>

<p>I hope you will communicate your opinions to me fully and frankly.</p>
<p><persName>S. F. Austin.</persName></p>
<p>To the <persName>Committee of Safety &amp;c. of <placeName>Columbia</placeName></persName>.</p>
