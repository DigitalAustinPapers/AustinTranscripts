<p><hi rend="italic">(No. 2.)</hi></p>

<p><placeName>Hazel Run</placeName> <date when="1824-07-18">July 18th 1824</date>.</p>
<p>Dear <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I wrote you some time last week, from <placeName>Hereulanium</placeName>,&#8212;by the way
of <placeName>Natchos</placeName>, but lest that letter should miscarry,&#8212; I write again,
&#8212; I arrived at <placeName>Herculaneum </placeName>on the <date when="1824-06-15">15th of June</date>,&#8212; I also
stated to you, that I was compelled to go by the way of
<placeName>Orleans</placeName>, and it proved a fortunate circumstance I did,&#8212;as the rains
have fallen in such torrents, that It would have been almost 
impossible for me to have got here,&#8212; I found all our friends well, that
is all that are left&#8212; I wrote you from <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>informing you
of the <hi rend="italic">death of <persName>Mother</persName></hi>,&#8212; I found <persName>Emily </persName><hi rend="italic">well </hi>She has born her
afflictions with much fortitude and has supported herself and <persName>family</persName>
(by her own exertions much better than could be expected 
considering the <hi rend="italic">destitultle situation</hi>, in which she was left&#8212; The 
affairs of <persName>Brother James</persName> is placed in such a Situation that It <hi rend="italic">will </hi>be
<hi rend="italic">impossible </hi>for <hi rend="italic">me </hi>to do any thing <hi rend="italic">with </hi>them, without detaining
longer in <placeName>Missouri </placeName>than I would be willing&#8212;therefore <hi rend="italic">I </hi>think the
<hi rend="italic">wisest </hi>plan <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can pursue, is to <hi rend="italic">leave </hi>the <hi rend="italic">damd </hi>country as soon as
possible&#8212;with <persName>Emily </persName>and her <persName>family</persName>&#8212;and leave the rest for <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to
finish should you <hi rend="italic">ever </hi>visit <placeName>Mo</placeName>&#8212; there are a number of <hi rend="italic">acts </hi>and
notes to be collected in this <placeName>neighborhood </placeName>but the estate has never
been administered upon therefore the collection of them can not be
<hi rend="italic">forced</hi>, untill that takes place&#8212; As to the <placeName>Little Rock property</placeName>,
when I was in <placeName>St Louis</placeName> <persName>Wm C Carr</persName> informed me that no difficulty
aught to originate respecting it&#8212;and If <persName>Ashley </persName>wished to do what
was just no difficulty could arrise&#8212;unless <persName>H. E. [Henry Elliott's]</persName>
estate should prove insolvent and his <hi rend="italic"><persName>Creditors </persName></hi>force the Sale of that
property&#8212;in that case he deemed it advisable for <persName>Emily </persName>to file a
Bill in chancery against <hi rend="italic"><persName>H. E. heirs</persName>.</hi></p>

<p>I have written to <persName>Ashley </persName>on the Subject and inclose your letter&#8212;
I have also directed him to forward every thing left at the <placeName>Little
Rock</placeName> to the <placeName>mouth of White River</placeName>&#8212; I also wrote to <persName>Cunningham</persName>
to do the same which I think they will comply with, as <persName>Ashley </persName>in a
letter to <persName>Emily </persName><hi rend="italic">observed </hi>that the things were <hi rend="italic">there </hi>subject to your
Order&#8212;<persName> A Scott</persName> came up in the same Boat with me from the
<placeName>mouth of White River</placeName> also <placeName>Mrs S.</placeName> and two of his <placeName>children </placeName>he
fought and killed <persName>Judge Seldon</persName> in a duel, a few days previous to
my arrival, at the <placeName>mouth of White R.</placeName> the cause of the dispute
was owing to some assertions <persName>Seldon </persName>made respecting him&#8212; <persName>Saml
Perry</persName> is at present absent to <placeName>Philidelphia </placeName>but is Expected back in a
short time   I understand he is very much dissatisfied at the present<pb n="855"/>
State of things at the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Mines</placeName></hi>, and I think your letter will have
considerable <hi rend="italic">effect</hi>&#8212; <persName>Price </persName>continues to persecute him and has
lately made some publications with an intention to injure him&#8212; It
is generally congectured something Serious will take place when
he returns from the <placeName>Eastward</placeName>&#8212; Nothing appears to excite so
much interest throughout the country, at present as the 
approaching election&#8212; <persName>Ashley </persName>and <persName>Bates </persName>are candidates for <persName>Govr </persName>and <persName>Wm
C. Carr</persName>, <persName>Nathl Cook</persName> and <persName>Evans </persName>are candidate for <persName>Lt Govr</persName>&#8212; these
elections will be warmly contested. <persName>Genl Rector</persName> has been removed
from office, by the influence of <hi rend="italic"><persName>David Barton</persName></hi>&#8212;this caused much 
excitement in <placeName>St Louis</placeName> and no doubt <hi rend="italic">"Bloody doings"</hi> will take place
on <hi rend="italic">"Bloody Island"</hi> in a short time&#8212;his <persName>successor </persName>is by the name of
<persName>McKea </persName>formerly attached to the <persName>corps of Engineer</persName>'s.&#8212;a man of
handsome tallents&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Emily </persName>and myself will visit the <placeName>mines </placeName>next week when I shall see
all your old <persName>acquaintances </persName><persName>James Bruffe[y]</persName> may be prevailed
on to move to the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have not heard one word from <persName>Varner</persName>. I have therefore 
concluded not to delay any longer. I shall be at <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>by the
<date when="1824-10-20">20th of Oct</date> or <date when="1824-11-01">1 of November</date> certainly, unless you make some other
arrangement&#8212; I would advise <hi rend="italic">you </hi>to send out 2 waggons and some
spare horses&#8212; I shall take on the <persName>family </persName>of <hi rend="italic"><persName>Negroes </persName>at all hazerds</hi>
it consists of <persName>Sarah </persName>and <persName>four children</persName>&#8212; A <persName>Mr. Carpenter</persName> who has
been living here for some time, and who Married <persName>Polly Barfield</persName>, that
formerly lived with <persName>Mrs. H Austin</persName> she has been living with <persName>Emily</persName>
for some time past&#8212; <persName>Mr. C.</persName> is a very <hi rend="italic">good man</hi> understands 
surveying and also is well acquainted with the <placeName>Missipa </placeName>and will be of much
Service to me on my journey,&#8212; <persName>Emily </persName>will want some one to 
accompany her and <persName>Mrs. C.</persName> has lived with her so long that had rather
she should accompany her&#8212;they will be of no expence to me on the
journey&#8212; I have promised him for his assistance to convey him
from <placeName>Natichitoches</placeName>. I shall buy a <hi rend="italic">good </hi>Dearbourn Waggan in <placeName>St.
Louis</placeName> covered over with oil cloth to keep out the rain&#8212;and I think
one that will answer for 1. or <hi rend="italic">two horses</hi> preferable as there will be
too much of a load for 1. horse&#8212;a light one that would answer for
1. horse and put a tongue to it for <hi rend="italic">two horses on the journey</hi> is the
kind I will get&#8212; I have nothing more to say&#8212;times are extremely
dull&#8212;the <placeName>Mississippi </placeName>has been higher <hi rend="italic">up here</hi> by 3 feet than last
year,&#8212;the crops are <hi rend="italic">all distroyed</hi> and provisions are to be very high
and <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi>&#8212;in fact I hardly know what a great many will do&#8212;I
would not positively exchange the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>for all the land I have
seen between here and there&#8212; I informed you of the death of <persName>Aunt
Austin</persName> She died shortly after the death of <persName>Mother</persName>&#8212; She has left
a large and helpless <persName>Family </persName>of <persName>Children </persName><hi rend="italic">God </hi>only knows what is
to become of them.   <persName>Wm </persName>will go on with me&#8212;<pb n="856"/></p>

<p>Give my respect [to] all my <persName>friends </persName>in that quarter particly to
<persName>John</persName>&#8212; I should like to have him meet me in <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>or if
you make other arrangements at <placeName>Orleans</placeName>&#8212;I saw a <persName>Genm </persName>in <placeName>St Louis
</placeName>who saw his <persName>Father </persName>and <persName>family </persName>a few <hi rend="italic">weeks </hi>since they were all
well&#8212;  <persName>Emily </persName>sends her love&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas B Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>Horace </persName>lives in <persName>St. Louis</persName> <hi rend="italic">poor man</hi> he has <hi rend="italic">wasted </hi>to a mere
skeliton and I expect is in his grave before this, an <persName>express </persName>came
down for <persName>Mary Honey</persName> the day after I left <placeName>St Louis</placeName>.&#8212;the <persName>Austins</persName>
will become extint in this country in a few years&#8212;</p>

<p>[In Margins:] I could say much more but I will wait untill I
come from the <placeName>Mines </placeName>I am almost sure that <persName>Jas Bruffe[y]</persName> will
move, he is much dissatisfied at the <placeName>mines</placeName>, he and <persName>Price </persName>are also at
Swords points,   I shall do my utmost to prevail on him to move</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col. Stepehn F. Austin. Politacal Chief of <placeName>Austins
Colony</placeName></persName>, in the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>. Via <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName></p>
