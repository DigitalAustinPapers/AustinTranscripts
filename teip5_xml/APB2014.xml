<p><hi rend="italic">Prov.  Texas</hi></p>
<p><placeName>Groces Retreat</placeName> <date when="1825-06-03">June 3d 1825.</date></p>
<p>My Dear <persName>Sister</persName>.</p>

<p>I receivd your welcome letter under date of <date when="1825-04-10">10th of April</date>, while on
a visit to this place and hasten to answer it, before I leave <hi rend="italic">this</hi>;
as opportunities more frequently occur from here, than <placeName>San Felipe</placeName></p>

<p>Not long since I wrote you; and <persName>Stephen </persName>at the same time 
forwarded an answer to<persName> Mr. Perry</persName>'s letter, which no doubt you will
receive in due time&#8212; You mention that a letter from <persName>Stephen </persName>dated
in <date n="12-xx-1824">Decemr. last</date> which you received, gave you more Satisfaction
(with respect to his reconciliation, of your choice of a <persName>partner</persName>) than
any before received, on that subject. Let me assure you My <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Sister </persName></hi>that he is not only reconciled but pleased, much pleased, with
your Choice&#8212;knowing as <hi rend="italic">he </hi>does, that <hi rend="italic">you </hi>would not take so impor-<pb n="1114"/>
tant a step without consulting <hi rend="italic">your happiness</hi>; The only objects dear
to us on this Earth being yourself and lovely <hi rend="italic">little </hi><persName>family</persName>, rest assured
whenever you are happy we shall be perfectly so&#8212;Our <persName>Brother</persName>
seems to think, owing to the yet infant state of the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>that
it would not be altogether advisable, for <persName>Mr. P. </persName>to remove to this
<placeName>country</placeName>, at present&#8212;there is nothing he could do, that would be
advantageous to him, for some years to come&#8212;tho I hope the 
<placeName>country </placeName>will so far improve in the course [of] a very [few] years, that
it will attract the attention of <persName>Mr. Perry</persName>&#8212;and be so much to his
interest that he will be induced to relinquish the <hi rend="italic">cold </hi>and unfriendly
Climate of <placeName>Mo.</placeName> for the more mild and salubrious one of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, where
I think the mildness of the Climate tends in some degree to Soften
the feelings of <hi rend="italic">Man </hi>and render him more like a natural <hi rend="italic">Being</hi>&#8212;
Indeed my dear <persName>Emily </persName>it certainly, will be <hi rend="italic">" the most joyful period
of our lives" </hi>when we can embrace our <persName>Sister </persName>with " peace and
plenty " smiling around us after the many vicissitudes we have passed
through for the last Six years&#8212;The time is not far distant, if our
lives are spared, when the fond <hi rend="italic">vision </hi>will be realized.</p>

<p>I am happy to hear <persName>Cousin Adeline</persName> has changed the name of
<persName>Bates </persName>for that of <persName>Lewis</persName>, and also that she has so soon commenced
housekeeping, may her life be long&#8212;prosperous and happy&#8212;and
may<hi rend="italic"> " misfortune not mark her for her one."</hi> You will greet her
with a kiss for me when you meet her&#8212;You were " pleased and 
provoked " at my <hi rend="italic">brevity </hi>in one of my last letters, and think that I can
never be at a loss for a subject when writing to my <persName>Sister</persName>&#8212;You will
please to excuse that letter and I will try and be more prolix in future.
I must have been in one of my <hi rend="italic">Lazy Moods</hi> when I wrote&#8212;<persName>Stephen</persName>
has not gone to the <placeName>City of Saltillo</placeName>, probably he will not go untill
<date n="Fall-1825">fall</date>, as he is fully determined to close the affairs of the <placeName>Colony</placeName>
before he makes his return to <persName>Govt</persName>, he can obtain the settling of
<hi rend="italic">500 </hi>or <hi rend="italic">600 </hi><persName>families </persName>more, by making application&#8212;Everything goes
on finely; not withstanding the unfavorable season we have had,
good crops will be made&#8212; <hi rend="italic">The <persName>Priest</persName></hi> will be on in a few days to
organize a <placeName>church </placeName>and attend to our spiritual affairs&#8212;Draw no 
conclusions from the date of my letter I am merely on a visit of a few
days, because I pass my time so heavy at <placeName>home</placeName>&#8212;and also, because
it is a pleasure to visit a <persName>family </persName>I esteem so highly as I do this.
Present my respects to <persName>Brother James</persName>&#8212;and kiss my charming <hi rend="italic">little
<persName>niece</persName></hi>, tell the <persName>Boys </persName>to study hard, and <persName>uncle </persName>will not forget any of
them <persName>Brother </persName>sends his love Your Affectionate Brother</p>

<p><persName>Jas. E. B. Austin</persName></p>

<p>I forgot to mention in one of my former letters that <persName>Robt Andrews
</persName>was dead    He has been dead nearly a year</p>

<p>(Addressed:) <persName>Mrs. Emily M. Perry</persName> Mail <placeName>Potosi, Missouri</placeName></p>
