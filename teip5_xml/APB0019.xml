<p>It is to be observed that agreeable to the above statement a balance
is due <persName>George Lauman</persName> which balance he supposes he has a claim on
us as taken up by our <persName>agent </persName>which I admit. But if a Six Months
Credit is allowed on this balance it will be found not to be due untill
the <date when="1796-05-28">28 May</date> so that it cannot operate against any demand I have
on the Land business. It ought also to be remember'd that my
Drafts was protested in <date n="10-xx-1975">October </date>and that at that time <persName>George 
Lauman</persName> was in my Debt £481 „ 11 as the last of the above goods say
£652.12.6 1/2 was not deliver'd untill <date when="1795-11-28">November the 28th</date> Nor was <persName>Mr
Lauman</persName> under any obligation to deliver any More goods than the
Sum due me nor did I wish him to do so. I cannot see why <persName>Mr 
Lauman</persName> may not as well demand a Credit for the £453.19.4 as for
£171.10.3 as that amount of goods was taken up by myself four days
after the £171.10.3 neither of which I conceive have any thing to
do with the land contract, Nor can my being in debt to <persName>George
Lauman</persName> or <persName>Lauman and West</persName> be consider'd as a violation of my
Contract with <persName>Blanchard and Lauman</persName> for Lands. I also wish to
remind the Gentlemen who are to give an opinion on this business
that<persName> Mr Lauman</persName> has agreed to make a discount on the above goods<pb n="27"/>
of One Hundred Pounds on account of their being overcharge.
Which discount I agreed should be settle'd with <persName>Mr Blanchard</persName> before
I understood how the balance of this account was to be applied, but
when it is considered that the Hundred pound ought to be taken off
from the amount Charged me a small balance will be found due
<persName>G Lauman</persName> so that justice cannot demand that <persName>Mr Lauman</persName> should
claim a Credit on account of the Land business nor do I think in
Justice I am bound to settle with <persName>Mr Lauman</persName> for any balance that
may be found due on this Exchange of property it not being 
agreeable to my Orders, Bequest or intention that <persName>Mr Blanchard</persName> should
receive any more than the balance due me from <persName>Mr Lauman</persName>.</p>
