<p><placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName><date when="1827-03-04">March 4 [1827]</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Williams</persName></p>

<p>I expected to have started <placeName>home </placeName>this day, but <persName>Ahumada </persName>has 
determined to visit the <placeName>country </placeName><placeName>as far as to the Sabine</placeName> and insists on
my accompanying him. I go with great reluctance for my thoughts
and feelings are all in the <placeName>Colony </placeName>and I am heartily tired of this
<placeName>country</placeName></p>

<p>It is perhaps a fortunate thing for me that I have learned patience
in the hard School of an <persName>Empresario </persName>for I assure you that in this
<placeName>place </placeName>I have had full use for all I possessed Things are all settled
here and I think tranquility is fully and firmly established but;
matters were in a dreadfull and a critical situation, and nothing
but the greatest prudence has prevented the most serious 
disturbances&#8212;<persName>Gains </persName>and a few <persName>others </persName>blamed <persName>Ahumada </persName>and me, and me
in particular for the course I have advised, but I have a 
consolation that to me is worth more than the approbation of any man,&#8212;
in the consciousness that I have done right&#8212;<persName>Fields </persName>and <persName>Hunter </persName>are
certainly killed by the <persName>Cherokees </persName>and all the other <persName>leaders </persName>of the
<persName>party </persName>have escaped over the <placeName>Sabine </placeName>and I advised a mild course
with those who were compromitted in a secondary degree and
<persName>Ahumada </persName>himself was in favor of such a course and adopted it<pb n="1611"/>
and for this a few <persName>men </persName>here blame me, but they are but few, for
the whole <placeName>country </placeName>in general are gratified, and the <persName>Mexican </persName>
character stands higher here now than it ever did before&#8212;I hope the
<persName>people of the <placeName>colony </placeName></persName>will be satisfied with me for next to the 
approbation of my own conscience, theirs is worth more to me than all the
world beside.</p>

<p>How comes the <placeName>Garden</placeName>? remember me to <persName>Mrs. Calvit</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
Long</persName>, has the promise which you was called on to witness been
complied with? if it has not you may tell that man to prepare for
the worst&#8212;I have been very unwell with a cold and am several
ounces lighter than when I started&#8212;remember me to <persName>Mrs. Picket
</persName>1 would write to her but this is the last scrap of paper I have or
can get remember me to my friend <persName>Westall </persName>and <persName>family </persName>and <persName>Pettus</persName>
and <persName>Mrs. Cummins</persName> and all others&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Brother </persName>and <persName>Col. Milam</persName> send their best respects to <persName>Mrs. Long</persName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>old Gefe</persName> and myself have appointed the <date when="1827-03-15">15 of this month</date>
to start home and I hope to be with you in all this month.</p>

<p>War between <placeName>England </placeName>and <placeName>Spain </placeName>and cotton looking up a little.</p>

<p>You cant imagine my anxiety to get <placeName>home </placeName>and had I not 
promised <persName>Ahumada </persName>to go to the <placeName>Sabine </placeName>with him on our first arrival
here I would start for <placeName>San Felipe </placeName>tomorrow, don't neglect to touch
up Mr. . . . [sic] about his promise. My feelings are deeply 
interested in that business and he shall do what he has promised and
perhaps a good deal more that I mean to make him do&#8212;I will stop
least I may go to bed in a bad humor for it is past 12 at night so
I bid you good night</p>

<p><persName>Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Mr. Sam M. Williams Administrador de Correos
</persName><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName></p>
