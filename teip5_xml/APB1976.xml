<p><placeName>Matamoros </placeName><date when="1830-07-02">July 2d. 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>Col S F Austin</persName>
</p>
<p>My dear Sir I have recd your favor dated <placeName>Bexar </placeName><date n="06/01/1830">June 1st </date>and
regret to observe you have heard nothing of my application for a
<placeName>grant </placeName>of land&#8212; My <persName>agent </persName>at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>said under date<date when="1830-05-08"> 8 May</date> that
he had made enquiry and found my business in a fair train, that
some document wanted your signature, this the Govt had sent to
<placeName>Texas </placeName>for signature and so soon as returned signed the solicitation
would be atended to&#8212;but as orders have been recd from the Genl
Govt not to grant any more <placeName>land </placeName>to <persName>citizens of the <placeName>US</placeName></persName> I fear I shall
be defeated&#8212;</p>

<p>The law of the <date when="1830-04-06">6 April</date> no doubt originated in a Jealousy of the
Views of the <placeName>US </placeName>and fears of the growing strength of the <persName>Colonists</persName>
in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; The Govts and <persName>people of <placeName>Mexico </placeName></persName>appear to become more
hostile daily to the <persName>citizens of the <placeName>US</placeName></persName>. and I am of opinion will 
ultimately drive them from <placeName>Mexico </placeName>or reduce the <placeName>U S</placeName> to the necessity of
compelling them to respect the rights of her <persName>Citizens</persName>&#8212; The 
<persName>authoritys </persName>here are now enforcing a law of this state which requires all
<persName>foreign Merchants</persName> except <hi rend="italic"><persName>English</persName>, <persName>German </persName></hi>and <hi rend="italic"><persName>Dutch </persName></hi>to pay one
pr ct on their capital in trade and on all importation during the last
year, whether on acct or consignment&#8212;</p>

<p>This <hi rend="italic">retroactive </hi>law in direct contravention of the Cons[titu]tion
is levelled so directly against the <persName>citizens of the <placeName>US</placeName></persName> (they being the
only <persName>merchts </persName>affected by it) as to give good grounds for serious
alarms, they are compelled to pay instanter or go to <placeName>prison</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Genl Teran</persName> is still here with two or three hundred <persName>men </persName>he is 
supposed to have orders to march to <placeName>Texas </placeName>but I am of opinion he will<pb n="436"/>
not leave this&#8212; The receipts at this<placeName> custom house</placeName> are the only 
resource for the payment of the <persName>troops </persName>in this department, the <persName>Genl</persName>
probably suspects that heretofore not one half the legal duties have
gone to acet of Govt and seems determined that in future every dollar
shall be secured his <persName>troops </persName>perform the duty of <persName>French </persName><hi rend="italic">Gens d'Arms</hi>
every point is guarded and the <persName>soldiers </persName>appear to be converted into
<persName><placeName>custom house</placeName> officers</persName>&#8212; The <persName>Genl </persName>dictates in all things he will kill
the goose in search of the golden eggs as this troublesome and
hazardous trade is profitless paying the whole dutys and will be
abandoned&#8212;</p>

<p>It is now said 1600 <persName>men </persName>are to be here shortly to be drilled I do
not believe they will be marched to the <placeName>frontier </placeName>as the <persName>Genl </persName>is 
convinced that the apprehensions of hostilitys by the <placeName>US</placeName> are without
grounds and that the <persName>colonists </persName>are content to remain as they are He
professes a disposition to favor the <persName>colonists </persName>in everything, says
he will make this part of the <placeName>country </placeName>flourish etc, but until more
stability can be infused into their Govt this is impossible</p>

<p>I think he has more apprehension of a Grito for Centralism in
the <placeName>South </placeName>and a separation of those <placeName>northern states</placeName> which are federal,
than of the <placeName>US </placeName>or <placeName>Texas </placeName>where in fact there is nothing to fear until
outrage shall produce difficulty&#8212;</p>

<p>I also suspect he counts upon much support from <placeName>Texas </placeName>in such
an event&#8212; I have abandoned the Navigation of this <placeName>river</placeName>, as I
have no benefit from the past and no security for the future&#8212;and
am preparing the steamboat for <placeName>Sea </placeName>I should be off in a Week
could I close my business but I do not like to leave 6 or 8000 dollars
behind me and shall continue two weeks to save what I can and
leave the rest to an <persName>agent</persName>&#8212; My intention is to run first to the
<placeName>Brassos de dios</placeName> where if the boat can be employed she shall remain,
if not, when the season will permit I will take her to the <placeName>Teché
River</placeName>&#8212; She is a boat of great speed and power carrys 100.000 lbs
freight and according to <persName>Capt J Austin</persName>s acct can run up to <persName>St
philipe </persName>excepting in the <placeName>lowest water</placeName>&#8212;- If she could get one full
freight a Month at the present rate of costage she would do better
than here&#8212;and the influx of population and goods should I think
warrant the expectation of so much employment&#8212;<persName> Col Bradburn
</persName>has again joined the army under <persName>Genl Teran </persName>and is now under orders
for <placeName>Galveston </placeName>in one of two Govt Schrs expected from <placeName>Tampico</placeName>
ostensibly to survey the <placeName>coast of Texas</placeName>&#8212; he is also I believe to
act as <persName>commisary </persName>for supplying the <persName>troops </persName>with provisions from <placeName>N Orleans</placeName>, He has recently returned from <placeName>Orleans </placeName>where he was sent by the <persName>Genl </persName>for the purpose as I have reason to believe of 
ascertaining the object of the <placeName>US </placeName>in establishing a <placeName>port on the sabine</placeName> and to
collect information as to the views of the <persName>Colonists</persName>&#8212;   His report<pb n="437"/>
as far as I can discover was that the <persName>troops </persName>were Stationed <placeName>near the
frontier</placeName> to prevent smuggling and that the <persName>colonists </persName>were quiet and
well disposed excepting some <persName>newcomers </persName>and idle disorderly young
men that no measures were necessary but to support <persName>Col Austin
</persName>with sufficient authority to controul this class of people you ask
if I am on good terms with the <persName>Genl </persName>I was on the best of terms
and had a high opinion of him, but since his return from <placeName>Tampico</placeName>
he has been too great a man to hold familiar intercourse with&#8212;
he obviously wishes to make himself popular in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and here&#8212;
but here he has rendered himself very unpopular, and is now thought
to be a very weak and arbitrary man&#8212; I am told he says "the
<persName>north americans</persName> who now think him their <persName>enemy </persName>will in a few-
months be perfectly satisfied with him&#8212;" what does this mean
can he contemplate bringing about some important change?</p>

<p>I wrote you two letters by <persName>Captn J Austin</persName> which I hope went
safe altho he had the misfortune to loose his sloop near <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>&#8212;
I adhere to the opinion expressed in the last, the report by <placeName>capt
Harkens</placeName> that you were coming here on your return from <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
gratified the <persName>Genl </persName>very much and he expresses a strong desire to
see you <hi rend="italic">here</hi></p>

<p>If it please God to permit me to escape from this detestable place
alive and to reach the <placeName>Brassos </placeName>in safety I may have the pleasure
to see you <date n="08-xx-1830">within a month</date> but so many difficultys spring up here
unexpectedly that no man can calculate upon any thing a week a
head&#8212; at present there is nothing in the way to prevent my
prompt departure but my reluctance to leave a large amount of
property to the mercy of <persName>agents </persName>in such a <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>H Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>The <placeName>country </placeName>is parched with drought Thermometor at 98 or
100 in the shade I fear the <placeName>river </placeName>may dry up and prevent my
departure The Sand drifts like the <placeName>desart of arabia</placeName> and makes us
very uncomfortable</p>
