<p>Altho I am aware that you think us a troublesome <persName>people </persName>and no
doubt but you are tired of our noise, still I must beg the indulgence
of one more hearing.</p>

<p>You are Aprised of the relative standing of <persName>Johnson</persName>, <persName>Hunter </persName>and
myself, as it respects the surveying of my land, as well the land of
<persName>others</persName>, and I am persuaded that you will not incourage him in 
impositions, and as we can have no decision on his lines, it can not be
reasonable that he should collect and keep the money for his 
surveying altho I have actually paid him for the surveying of <placeName>my
League</placeName>, yet still I owe him a ballance on our private settlement,
which ballance he has brought suit for and obtained a judgment
before our <persName>Alcalde</persName>. Yet I hope, sir that you will authorise me to
withhold the payment of this judgment untill a decision can be had
respecting these disputed lines. I am not nor never was opposed to
the payment of any just debt, but I can not think that it is just for
<persName>Johnson </persName>or <persName>Hunter </persName>to receive the full payment for his surveying
when his work is so obviously disputed. I hope, sir you will take
this matter into consideration and deal justly and strictly between<pb n="1480"/>
<persName>Hunter </persName>and <persName>myself</persName>. Justice is all I want and if it is justice for
<persName>Hunter </persName>to recover the money for the surveying of my land and
keep it under these existing circumstances I submit. But if it is
justice for me to keep back (at least) a part, I want to do so. The
amount of the judgment that <persName>Hunter </persName>holds against me is $41 the
amount of the surveying is much more than that some, but if I could
retain the amount of the judgment in my hands untill the correctness
of the lines could be ascertained, it would fully satisfy me.</p>

<p>But in all cases I am willing to submit to the judicious laws of my
<placeName>Country </placeName>and in this case, to your better judgment I subscribe myself
with every degree of submission</p>
