<p><placeName>San felipe de Austin </placeName><date when="1825-09-06">6 sepr 1825</date></p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>Your letter I have recd and it appears from it that <persName>Mr Coles</persName> 
declines to comply with the requisition to him in my letter of <date when="1825-09-06">this
morning</date> and as you state considers that my request merits no 
attention&#8212;that is he absolutely refuses to restore <persName>Richmond</persName>s Deed
or make any satisfaction for his conduct&#8212;As to the surprize you
express at my demand on <persName>Coles</persName> I can't see why you ought to feel
any from any thing that occurred at our interview and considering
the ungentlemanlike manner in which <persName>Coles</persName> has used me&#8212;His
complying with your order is no excuse for his conduct On the
contrary it is just ground of complaint because that order was
illegal&#8212;What right had you sir to order or pretend to any 
controul over the property of others&#8212;What right had he to obey such
illegal order&#8212;How can he attempt to defend his conduct in writing
I may I say advising you to adopt the unfortunate course that has
been taken and then endeavr to impose upon me by a denial of his<pb n="1192"/>
underhand practices&#8212;If <persName>Mr. Coles</persName> thinks charges of this kind
and which can be proven too, merit no attention he thinks as a
man devoid of feeling for his own character or the opinion of his
fellow <persName>citizens </persName>for believe me that opinion shall shortly be elicited&#8212;
You state he was in duty bound to send you the <hi rend="italic">paper </hi>as you
are pleased to term it&#8212;Sir yr idea of duty and mine are very 
different&#8212;</p>

<p>As to the mistake you speak of in the Deed you have adopted a
singular way of rectifying it, by stifling the Instrument in toto</p>

<p>"&#8212;You say independent of this mistake and admitting there was
none that <persName>David Richmond</persName> was not such a person as the law
recognized as a <persName>suitable Character to be received as a settler
</persName>that he was a <persName>drunken vagabond</persName> in the full extent of the 
expression and was not such a person as you could feel justified in 
returning to the <persName>Government </persName>as a <persName>settler </persName>and for that reason and many
others of still greater weight you are entirely justifiable in never
recognizing him as a <persName>settler </persName>at all " But Sir why did you recognize
him&#8212;why did you grant Land to this <persName>drunken vagabond</persName>&#8212;why did
you not discover all this prior to such <placeName>grant</placeName>&#8212;And you now must
punish the transgressions of the unfortunate mans life by throwing
obliquy on his memory, as it were passing a post humus judgement
on him for his sins by depriving his <persName>heir </persName>of her just bequest&#8212;this
is an erroneous principle to punish a mans errors by a confiscation
(for this process is nothing else) of his property after his death</p>

<p>As to the Comments in yours on my course in this business it merits
not the epithet of violent which you are pleased to bestow upon it&#8212;
It has not been violent&#8212; I have demanded my right&#8212; I have done
it firmly and whether ill calculated or not to obtain the result of my
wishes It is a course I can perfectly reconcile to my conscience and
I fear not the result&#8212;but be that result what it may I never shall
suffer my rights or those of <persName>others entrusted to my charge</persName> to be
trampled on by any man or combinatn of men&#8212; It still is my wish
that this affair should be settled as it ought by an imediate 
restoration of the deed in question, but I cannot see any benefit to arise from
a personal Communication with you on the subject untill the Deed
is restored&#8212;The existence of it is a notorious fact it can be proven by
those who have <hi rend="italic">read and were capable of knowing</hi> its contents and
who can testify on oath as to the same&#8212;I shall expect a final answer
in the course of <date when="1825-09-10">tomorrow </date>and unless restitution is made in that time
I shall lay the whole transaction before the <persName>public </persName>together with my
opinion of the conduct and character of <persName>John P Coles</persName></p>
