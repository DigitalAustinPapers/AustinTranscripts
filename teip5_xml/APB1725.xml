<p>At <placeName><persName>Mr Scott</persName>s</placeName> <date when="1829-06-09">June 9th 1829</date></p>
<p>My Dear Sir</p>

<p>After much fatigue and some bruising the Eclipse has arrived
safely at <placeName>Rightors point bar</placeName>. We got into <placeName>Galveston Bay</placeName> on 
<date when="1829-06-03">Wednesday</date>&#8212;Came into the <placeName>Bay </placeName><placeName>by the S. W. Channel</placeName>&#8212;beat in and found<pb n="222"/>
it a good passage 11 feet shoalest Cast&#8212;I think it first rate for all
vessels not over 9 feet draft of water.&#8212;We touched slightly on two
<placeName>bars </placeName>but got off without difficulty&#8212;beat up to <placeName>Redfish bar</placeName> on 
<date when="1829-06-04">Thursday morning</date>&#8212;good <placeName>Channel </placeName>about 10 feet&#8212;from Thursday to 
<date when="1829-06-07">Sunday evening</date> We were watching the bar <persName>John </persName>and myself sounded it
all over&#8212;We found it staked out but as the water was low hoped to
find a <placeName>deeper place</placeName> however We were disappointed&#8212;and on Sunday
night and <date when="1829-06-08">monday morning</date> pressed and worried her over in 41/2
feet water she drawing 5 1/2. <hi rend="italic">twont do</hi> except at full, and change
tides, except for vessels of an easy draft. About the same water
at <placeName>Righters point bar</placeName>,&#8212;<persName>Harris </persName>has gone up to <placeName>Harrisburg </placeName>and I
expect the Eclipse will be discharged at the <placeName>point</placeName>&#8212;The freight for
her was sent on in the Alert and the Eclipse will have to go in
without freight&#8212;While we were lying at the <placeName>bar </placeName><persName>Doctors Woodbury</persName>
and <persName>Cameron</persName> Came on <placeName>board </placeName>us I had some conversation with the
former, he expressed much anxiety to receive a letter from you&#8212;he
told me he had received the sanction of the <persName>Superioridad </persName>for the 10
<placeName>litorales </placeName>adjoining you <placeName>Eastwardly </placeName>and <placeName>extending six leagues in
the limitrofe</placeName>&#8212;Our friend <persName>hatchet </persName>faced <persName>Davy </persName>is too late&#8212;further
he said this, a branch in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>he expected to interest a very wealthy
House in <placeName>Phila</placeName>. and flatters himself with doing much for <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;said
much about the<placeName> Hacienda Nacional</placeName>, no money&#8212;no prospect except
from <placeName>Gran Bretaña</placeName>, for which he thinks the <placeName>southern territory</placeName> will
go&#8212;he says we shall soon be left to take care of ourselves&#8212;he 
expressed very much anxiety to have your letter Contain, a sentence
respecting the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Nagurs </persName></hi>about the security for introduction etc. had
understood at<placeName> S. f. de A</placeName> and at other places on the road this side of
<placeName>Bexar</placeName>, that they could be introduced, and would be secure&#8212;this
opinion Came from you&#8212;he asked me many questions on the subject
and said on account of yr known standing etc much weight would be
given to any thing <hi rend="italic">U</hi>&#8212;said on the subject and wished you to be full
on that point, alth° he did not wish you to enter into Compromisos&#8212;
I enclose you his note,&#8212;<persName>Cameron </persName>also wished to hear from you&#8212;</p>

<p>I expect <persName>Mr, Scott</persName> will go over about the <date when="1829-07-01">first of next month</date> to
bring <persName>Sarah </persName>and the <persName>Children </persName>over here, and as it is probable that
<persName>Gorge </persName>may be anxious to come likewise, and that you may not wish
to use all the time about Town I wish you to get <persName>Mr. Ingram</persName> to stay
there, and give <persName>Aunt mary</persName> instructions how to track.<pb n="223"/></p>

<p><persName>Woodbury </persName>informed me that <persName>Poinsett </persName>was interested in the 
Contract which had been made by the <persName>Govt </persName>to <persName>Zavala</persName>, I also in one on the
<placeName>Guazacoaleo </placeName>and Complained much of having been interfered with
by <persName>Poinsett </persName>in his Contracts with the Govt particularly in the 
Contract for the <persName>litorales </persName>in front of his <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212; I presume that 
<persName>Poinsett </persName>has been speculating in his official capacity to his individual
benifit.</p>

<p>I hope we will be off in a day or two, and am as ever yours</p>

<p>[On margin:] Please write to <persName>Brown </persName>and request him to send up
my saddle by some safe oppy.</p>
