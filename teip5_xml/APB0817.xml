<p>Dear Sir Since last writing you I have prepared a Power of
Attorney to enable the Judge to do something in that <persName>Modeira </persName>
business I fear that <persName>Dimmit </persName>has [not?] done what I instructed him
<persName>Mosquis </persName>and his friend <persName>Donvictor </persName>both promised to aid him in the
collection of debt In fact they are honourably bound to pay the
money it was [with] them my <persName>Brother </persName>Contracted for the freight
of those articles and Not <persName>Modeira </persName>and fact <persName>Don Victor Blanco</persName> 
offered to pay the Money before they left <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> and in a letter
from <placeName>Mont Clover [Monclova]</placeName> offered his services again to Collect
that Money I have No hesitation in believing that <persName>Mosquis </persName>and
<persName>Donvictor </persName>will not suffer me to loose that Money it was hardly
earned I paid out of my Own pocket at least $150 to vessels and
hands to endevor to get their Articles landed at the <placeName>Guadaloop</placeName>
Instead of the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>where My <placeName>Brother </placeName>agreed to land them,
that was done to save Carriage from the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>to <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>
this they know to be true under those Circumstances they ought
to feel themselves bound to pay that debt please get <persName>Judge Austin</persName>
and <persName>Allouri </persName>to sell the property also to Collect this Money <persName>Don
Manuel Allouri</persName> knows me to be a correct Man I must feel 
satisfied that when I left <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> that I had Made more than ample
arrangement to have [illegible] debt paid I left in the hands of
Dimmit at least $1100 of claims On what the best men in Country
the Go. among the rest say if <persName>Sandovall </persName>paid <persName>Dimmit </persName>the money<pb n="871"/>
I loaned him and what has become of him, If his own Country Men
after the services rendered them will de[a]l so dishonest it is a 
misfortune I had rather beg my bread than live among men that you
cannot make a transaction with without being deceived by them I
can say with truth that the only honest men in the Two Citties are
<persName>Don Erasmo</persName> <persName>Don Allouri</persName> <persName>Don Victor Blanco</persName> and <persName>Don E. Mosquis
</persName>. . . [torn] did the <persName>Don Doctor hewitson</persName> ever pay <persName>Dimmit </persName>for the
gold Watch which I let him have I should like to know what has
become of the <persName>Doctor </persName>if married to some lady that any man can have
access to who has a little cash I fear that is his fate before this period
at <placeName>Mon Clover</placeName> I have so many things to say that I am at a loss
what to say first please speek of me to our <persName>friends in <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>
</persName>affectionately particularly <persName>Baron de Bastropp</persName></p>
<p>god bless you</p>

<p><persName>L. B. Hawkins</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>James E. B. Austin Esq</persName> <placeName>Herculanium Missouri</placeName>
Write often and ask your good <persName>Brother </persName>to do the same   the loss
[of] our <persName>Brother </persName>is not to be repaired to his or my <persName>family    </persName>all our
losses and disappointments on this world together dose not equal
that</p>

<p><persName>L. B. Hawkins</persName>.</p>
