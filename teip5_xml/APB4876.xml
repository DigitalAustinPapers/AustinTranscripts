<p>Copy of a letter from <persName>Col S. F. Austin</persName> to<persName> P. W. Grayson</persName>, <placeName>Columbia</placeName>,
dated <date when="1835-09-19">Sep. 19th 1835</date></p>

<p>Dr Sir. The final answer of <persName>Gen Cos</persName> has just been recd&#8212; It is positive
that the <persName>persons who have been demanded</persName> shall be given up&#8212;and that the
<persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> must unconditionally submit&#8212;to any reforms or 
lterations that <persName>Congress </persName>has to make in the Constitution&#8212; I give you the 
substance, which is that we have no rights except what the <persName>Govt </persName>think proper
to grant us as a favour.</p>

<p>Can or will the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> submit to this! According to the position
already taken by them they cannot.&#8212;</p>

<p>War then is <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi>&#8212; It is impossible to avoid it&#8212; This is my
opinion and I have therefore issued the <placeName>circular </placeName>from the <persName>committee of
this place</persName> which goes below by this opportunity I have written to <persName>Hall</persName>,
and advised the raising of a <persName>Volunteer Corps</persName>, to be ready for immediate
opperations&#8212; I think he could raise such a <persName>corps</persName>&#8212; <placeName>Texas </placeName>now needs
the <persName>united councils</persName> and cooperation of every man <hi rend="italic">in </hi>it&#8212; <persName>War and peace
parties</persName> are at an end&#8212; There is no remedy but to fight&#8212; I shall send
to <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>A <persName>Gentleman </persName>writes from <placeName>Bexar </placeName>that the <placeName>country </placeName>will be invaded whether
the obnoxious individuals, (the <persName>persons demanded by Ugartechea</persName>) are
given up or not, and the land business and everything else is to be regulated
by the <persName>military</persName>. and he says the <persName>people </persName>must make up their minds either
to submit or prepare for defence.</p>

<p>I place more reliance on what he says because he has made so many
exertions to effect an amicable reconciliation. He also says that he will
stay and see <hi rend="italic">Cos</hi>. though he has no hopes of doing any thing&#8212;</p>

<p>I think he has been faithful to the <persName>people </persName>here and fear he will get into
<placeName>prison</placeName>&#8212;<pb n="128"/></p>

<p>Now my friend tell me what we can do except to fight&#8212; an attempt
at reconciliation has been made and failed, and the <persName>agents </persName>(for <persName>Barrett</persName>
who has returned says the same thing&#8212; who were sent, say that we must
submit or fight&#8212; Is the <placeName>Country </placeName>or any <persName>man </persName>in it ready or willing to
submit to a <persName>Military Despot</persName>.&#8212; I think not and for this reason I thought
it was my duty to let the people know their true situation, as I done in the
<placeName>Circular</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Give me your opinion and that of the <persName>people <placeName>in that quarter</placeName></persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>These things have come on us much sooner than I expected when I left
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>or <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> but there is no remedy that I see&#8212; <persName>Cos </persName>has 
precipitated them&#8212; Two <persName>Regiments</persName> it is said are ordered on from <placeName>San Luis</placeName>, and
also the <persName>Campeachy Troops</persName>&#8212; So says our <persName>informant </persName>who heard it in
<placeName>Bexar</placeName></p>
