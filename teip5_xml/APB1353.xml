<p>Dr Sir I received your favor by <persName>Mr Cortis</persName> and am much 
conserned in consequence of the many troubles and difficulties that
appear to oppose the colonizing sistem<pb n="1622"/></p>

<p>The manner in which the <persName>slave </persName>question is desided will be a grait
objection to the <persName>American population</persName> and I fear will put a Suden
stop to that population, that would be benificial to <persName>Embroserios
[empresarios.]</persName> The <persName>shawnies </persName>you say is admited by an order of the
Governor to become <persName>setlers</persName>, and I understand it corectly they have
all the privaleges of other <persName>citizens </persName>in cais they cultivait the soil.
If this be the cais we may bid adue to our antisapated pleasure for
<persName>society </persName>never will improve under those circumstances</p>

<p>As it respects the commercial arangement I was not able to do
aneything definait I converst with <persName>Jas W Zacharia</persName> he I believe
would Enter in to the business if he was sertain the <persName>parties </persName>was
well acquainted with the Mercantile business</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that it would be well for <persName>John Austin </persName>to visit
<placeName>Orleans </placeName>give to <persName>Zacharia </persName>a fool [full] description of the <placeName>Country</placeName>
and the prospects of traid and I have no doubt but he would advans
to aney amount that would be required</p>

<p>I only spent three days in <placeName>Neworleans </placeName>and had not an opertunity
of completing the hole of my business and had not a decisive answer
on yours whil in <placeName>Orleans </placeName>I received leter from <persName>wavell </persName>as lait as the
<date when="1826-12-30">30 of December</date> he has much dificulty in making his aragements
but says he will leave in a few weaks for this plais.</p>

<p>As it respects the Extention of <placeName>teritory </placeName>I believe it has all blown
over as there has been nothing said on the subject through the hole
sesión of <persName>congress</persName>.</p>

<p>I leave this in the <date when="1827-03-31">morning </date>for <placeName>pecoun pint [Pecan Point]</placeName>. A
little Tristy in consiquens of the inducements Extended to the 
<persName>Indians </persName>by the Government. I feare they will be a little troublesom
to the <placeName>setelments </placeName>but I will distroy Every thing like discord as fair
as is in my power and hope for a chainge a spedy chainge for the
better</p>

<p><persName>Ben E Milam</persName></p>

<p>Give my respects to all <persName>friends </persName>and write as often as you have
opertunity&#8212;the <persName>fredonians </persName>is all here rather under the wether
