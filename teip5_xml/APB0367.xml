<p>At the <placeName>City of San Fernando de Bexar</placeName>, the <date n="12-3-1820">23d day of December,
A D 1820</date>: The <persName>Governor of the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>, Colonel Don
Antonio Martinez</persName>, in order to obtain detailed information about
the condition of affairs and movements on the <placeName>frontier of the United
States</placeName>, and the assembly of men in <placeName>Galveston Island</placeName>, summoned to
appear at this office the foreigner <persName>Moses Austin</persName>, who arrived <date when="1820-12-23">to-day</date>
in this city, with two other persons. Said <persName>Moses Austin</persName> being 
present was required through the <persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName> who had promised
well and truly to discharge the duty of <persName>Interpreter</persName>, to make true
answers to such questions as might be propounded to him, answered
as follows.</p>

<p>Questioned as to his name, native country and residence&#8212;
Answered : That he is a native of the <placeName>State of Connecticut</placeName>, actually a
<persName>resident of <placeName>Missouri</placeName></persName>, is a <persName>catholic</persName>, a <persName>merchant </persName>and <persName>dealer in lead ore</persName>.</p>

<p>Asked:&#8212;Whence he came, who accompanied him, and what is his
object in entering this <placeName>Province</placeName>? Answered: That he came from
<placeName>Missouri </placeName>through <placeName>Nachitotches</placeName>, that he had been accompanied by
a <persName>negro boy</persName> belonging to him, and two other <persName>Americans</persName>; that he came
to this <placeName>Province </placeName>for the purpose of applying to the <persName>Government </persName>for
authorization to settle himself in it with his <persName>family</persName>, inasmuch as he
had already been a <persName>subject of the Government of <placeName>Spain</placeName></persName>, as is proved
by a passport, which he presented, signed by <persName>Don Carlos Martinez
de Irujo, Minister Plenipotentiary of His Majesty</persName>, signed at 
<placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, the <date when="1797-07-13">13th July, 1797</date>; and that it is his intention to provide
for his subsistance by raising sugar and Cotton.</p>

<p>Asked: what observations he made on his way from <placeName>Missouri</placeName>; if
he knows anything about the movements of the <persName>banditti </persName>on the 
<placeName>frontier of the United States</placeName>, if he has seen, or heard, anything of the
state of affairs in <placeName>Galveston Island</placeName>, and to state whatever incident
may have called his attention.&#8212;Answered: That he has observed
nothing on his way from <placeName>Missouri</placeName>; that he had only heard it said at
<placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>that <persName>Long </persName>has been abandoned by his men, <persName>20 or 30
men</persName> only still remaining with him; that <persName>Lafitte </persName>has abandoned 
<placeName>Galveston Island</placeName>, after having been attacked by an American frigate,
and that the <persName>President of the Congress</persName> had promised a reward of
500 Dollars for the apprehension of <persName>Long [Lafitte]</persName> That <persName>Lafitte</persName>
repaired to <placeName>South America</placeName>, but that, on his departure from <placeName>Galveston</placeName>,
he captured an <persName>American </persName>ship, and put to death all her <persName>crew</persName>, except
two men who made good their escape; and finally, that he has read in<pb n="371"/>
the <placeName>American newspapers</placeName> a treaty made by <placeName>Don Luis de Onis, Spanish
Minister</placeName>, with the <persName>American Congress</persName>, which treaty was already
signed by the <persName>King </persName>and approved by the <persName>Sovereign Congress of the
Cortes</persName>.</p>

<p>Asked; How, having obtained in<date n="xx-xx-1797"> 1797</date>, a passport from the <persName>Spanish
Minister</persName>, he has not applied sooner for the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>he intends
to make in this <placeName>Province</placeName>?&#8212;Answered,&#8212;that, since the year above
mentioned, he went to reside at<placeName> Saint Louis (Missouri)</placeName> which 
<placeName>territory </placeName>belonged, then to <placeName>Spain</placeName>; he had there <placeName>lead mines</placeName>, the produce
of which he exported to <placeName>Havana</placeName>, until the year <date n="xx-xx-1800">1800</date> [sic], when the
<persName>American Government</persName> having prohibited the working of <placeName>mines </placeName>by
private enterprise, he lost all the benefit of his labor; but now, in view
of the new system of Government adopted by <placeName>Spain</placeName>, he resolved
upon aplying for authorization to settle in this <placeName>Province</placeName></p>

<p>Asked; If he, or his <persName>associates </persName>have with them any merchandize,
to declare the same in which case it should be sequestered and 
returned to them previous to their leaving this <placeName>territory</placeName>, or otherwise,
it should be seized upon as unlawful ?&#8212;Answered, that all the 
property he has with him, is an escopet, a pistol, two horses, some clothing
for his personal use, and the necessary amount of money for his
traveling expences; that, those who accompany him are not under
his control, and joined him at about six leagues from <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>;
Still, he is satisfied that they have no goods of illicit trade.</p>

<p>Asked: If he has any further statements to make; Answered in the
negative, He, further, ratified the foregoing answers, and declared
himself to be 53 years of age; Whereupon, he signed these presents,
with me and assisting <persName>witnesses</persName>&#8212;<persName>Moses Austin</persName>&#8212;<persName>Antonio Martinez</persName>&#8212;
<persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName>&#8212;<persName>Francisco Montes</persName>&#8212;<persName>Ylario de la Garza</persName>.</p>
