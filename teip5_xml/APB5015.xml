<p><placeName>Head Quarters </placeName><date when="1835-11-02">Nov. 2d 1835</date></p>
<p><placeName>One Mile above Bexar</placeName></p>
<p>To <persName>P. Dimmit Comandant at <placeName>Goliad</placeName></persName></p>

<p>I have the Satisfaction to inform you that on the <date when="1835-10-28">morning of the 28th
ultimo</date>, there was an attack made by about <persName>300 Cavalry</persName> and <persName>100 infantry</persName>
of the <persName>enemy</persName>, upon a <persName>Detachment of the Army</persName>, Commanded by <persName>Col. James
Bowie</persName> and <persName>Capn Fanning</persName> near the <placeName>Mission Concepcion</placeName>, The <persName>enemy</persName>
brought on 2 pieces of Cannon for a vigorous assault.&#8212;They were received
in the best Manner&#8212;The battle lasted for some 2 or 3 hours and resulted
in the retreat of the <persName>enemy </persName>with the loss as we have well ascertained of at
least <persName>50 Killed and wounded</persName>&#8212;and one piece of Cannon&#8212;Sixteen were left
<persName>dead <placeName>on the field</placeName></persName>, and <persName>2 wounded</persName>&#8212;the balance were Carried off&#8212;Our
men were posted <placeName>along the bank of the river</placeName> under good cover and 
sustained the loss of only one man. <persName>Richd Andrews of <placeName>Mina</placeName></persName> mortally wounded
and since dead&#8212;</p>

<p>In regard to future operations here, I am afraid they will be tedious and
prolonged, owing to the Strength of the <placeName>fortifications </placeName>of this place of
which we have Certain information&#8212;</p>

<p>Whether the <persName>Army </persName>Can be Kept together long enough to await the 
arrival of <persName>reinforcements </persName>and the necessary supply of heavy battering 
Cannon and Munitions I am sorry to say is somewhat uncertain&#8212; It has been<pb n="233"/>
almost unanimously decided by a <persName>Council of the officers</persName> that the place is
too strong to be stormed by the Kind of force we have&#8212;There was from
this opinion but one dissenting voice&#8212;So you see our Condition&#8212;</p>

<p>There was a rumor which came from <placeName>Bexar </placeName><date when="1835-11-01">yesterday </date>that <persName>Savariego</persName>
had escaped from <placeName>S Felipe</placeName>&#8212;gone to the <placeName>Nueces </placeName>raised the <persName>Irish </persName>there and
joining them with the <persName>troops </persName>at that place had attacked <placeName>Goliad</placeName>&#8212; But I
attach no credit to the report, as I know positively that he <persName>Savariego </persName>was in
<placeName>S. Felipe</placeName> <date when="1835-10-27">a week ago</date></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
<p>P S My health has been very bad since I was at <placeName>Cibolo </placeName>and has not
improved&#8212;quite the reverse&#8212;I am much debilitated.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. A.</persName></p>

<p>Your last Communications were recd giving an account of the 
provisions on the way, for which we are very grateful.</p>
