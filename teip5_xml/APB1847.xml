<p><persName>Col S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>My dear Sir I avail myself of an opportunity to your place to
send you a <placeName>pamphlet </placeName>on the transfer of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>Both <persName>governments </persName>were intent upon the measure, but I am 
fearfull the late revolution may retard if it do not defeat the project
altogether.</p>

<p>I send by the same conveyance a letter for <persName>T J Chambers</persName> 
surveyer General</persName> . Should he be in your <placeName>neighbourhood </placeName>do me the
favor to receive the letter from <persName>Mr Renolds</persName> and send it to <persName>Mr
Chambers</persName>. The object of the letter is to request payment for a set
of <persName>surveyors </persName>instruments which I brought out at his request and
have had here more than <date n="07-xx-1829">six months</date>.</p>

<p>The last season has been extremely sickly here. My operations
have been suspended more than three months by the sickness of all<pb n="323"/>
my <persName>men</persName>. I am now endeavouring to close my business with a view
to leave this as soon as I can but it will take me some months at
best to get away.</p>

<p>The <placeName>cotton gins</placeName> sent you by<persName> Mr Coit</persName> were sent by my request
under the supposition they would be useful to you. You will please
have them sold for whatever they will fetch.</p>

<p>My <persName>Mexican </persName>operations have all proved very unfortunate and if
I should be so fortunate as to extricate myself from the present one
without loss to my <persName>friends </persName>I shall hardly engage in any others.
There is such an inveterate jealousy of <persName>strangers </persName>and so much perfidy
in the <persName>Mexican people</persName> that nothing conducted by a <persName>stranger </persName>can
succeed if they can prevent it. When I leave this I shall shape my
course for <placeName>New Orleans </placeName>and if circumstances permit will visit you
Our <persName>family </persName>has been truly unfortunate for many years past. You
are I believe the only <persName>member </persName>of it who has been successfull and
your success has been dearly purchased. Should a transfer of the
<placeName>province </placeName>take place you cannot fail to realize a splendid fortune
from your exertions.</p>

<p>We have had many rumors here of a revolutionary disposition in
the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>on account of the decree freeing all <persName>slaves </persName>in
the <placeName>Republic</placeName>, the <persName>Mexicans </persName>appear to be very jealous of your 
encreasing strength and I think the conviction that <placeName>Texas </placeName>cannot long
remain theirs may determine them to sell to the<placeName> U S</placeName> now they have
an opportunity. <persName>Major Butler</persName> who is now in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>as charge des
affairs has undoubtedly instructions to make the purchase if it can
be done on reasonable terms. Do me the favor to inform me at
what price a square league lands with a perfected title can be had
in the <placeName>Colony</placeName>. The acquisition by settlement is too tedious a 
process for me to undertake besides I detest every thing that brings me
in contact with <persName>Mexican authority</persName>.</p>

<p>your <persName>friend </persName>and <persName>cousin </persName><persName>Henry Austin</persName>-</p>

<p>PS, I have a <placeName>printing press</placeName>, and types, is it wanted in <placeName>Texas </placeName>It will not sell here as the <persName>people </persName>cannot read,   the value is 1500$</p>
