<p><placeName>Caledonia [Missouri]</placeName> 8th January 1822.</p>
<p>Dear <persName>Stephen. F.</persName></p>

<p>I now imbrase an oppertunity of writing you by <persName>Mr Bruffy</persName> whom
I expect will hand you this and can Inform you of the Times in
this <placeName>Country </placeName>as well as what I could by letter my object In writing
you at this time in this 1st I Expect that by writing to you you will
Inform me of your health and situation in that much Admiared
<placeName>Country </placeName>of yours 2nd I have seen some of your letters or extracts of
them which have almost put me in a Fever to sell out and move
without any further information about the country; an Idea struck
me a few days since on viewing a statement of the situation and
climate of the <placeName>provence of <hi rend="italic">Texas </hi></placeName>that a man could in a short time
accumulate considerable welth by the establishment of a <placeName>clothers
factory</placeName> in your country I have now allmost redy to go into 
operation near this place a <placeName>fulling mill</placeName> carding machine for wool and
cotton as also Two Spining Mashines one for wool and one for
cotton and owing to the Great quantity of Sheep and the cheapness
of wool in your <placeName>country </placeName>if you have aney water <placeName>Streems </placeName>that would
admit of; or be Sufficient to drive Machinery with out two much
expence I am of the opinion such an establishment would not only Be
of an advantaige to the <persName>Inhabitants </persName>but would be profitable to the
<persName>owner</persName>; If I could be convinced of the above I would bring my 
Machinery with me to your country and Establish it there; I shall if I
have as much good Luck as bad have my works in operation by
<date n="04-xx-1822"><hi rend="italic">Aprial </hi>next</date>; and if you will by letter give me such <hi rend="italic">encoraigement</hi>
as I flatter myself you will I will sell all my property here and move
immeditely with the Machinery if I should moove I will or can
bring with me several young men <persName>Mechanicks </persName>etc. I wish you to
give me a complete detail of all the advantaiges which a man in my
situation ought to calculate on by mooving as well as of the disad-<pb n="463"/>
vantaiges which would restult to a <persName>new emigrant</persName> in your place;
Inform me what would be the best route for a man to travel from
this place to your country&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Maria </persName>wishes to be remembered to you</p>

<p><persName>Th. H. Ficklin</persName></p>
