<p><date when="1824-06-14">June 14&#8212;1824</date></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I recd. your letter this morning informing me of the affair with
three <persName>Karankaways </persName>on the <placeName>River </placeName>near <placeName><persName>Keykendall</persName>s </placeName>and in which
you request the men from here to meet on the <date when="1824-06-15">15</date> instead of the <date when="1824-06-20">20</date>&#8212;
It will be impossible to give notice to the men in the upper part of
this Company Sooner than <date when="1824-06-15">tomorrow </date>and it then would take them
2 days to get to the place of rendavous, I have therefore thought
it most advisable to send on as many as are ready from this place
one of whom will go by the <placeName>fort </placeName>to hurry those from that quarter&#8212;
on the <date when="1824-06-16">16th</date> or night of the <date when="1824-06-15">15</date>. I think it would be advisable for
you to send out three sets of <persName>spies</persName>, one down the <placeName>Bay Prairie</placeName>, one
down the <placeName>west bank of the Colorado</placeName>, and one over in the direction
towards <placeName>La Baca</placeName> with a view of finding where the <persName>Indians </persName>are 
encamped, the <persName>spies </persName>should be most particularly charged to use every<pb n="832"/>
possible precaution to prevent their being seen by the <persName>Indians</persName>, and
to return to the place fixed upon for the general rendavous on the
night of the <date when="1824-06-19">19th</date>&#8212;by which time, all the Men will [be] there, and
as the <persName>Spies </persName>will probably find the <placeName>Camps of the <persName>Indians</persName></placeName> you can
then March directly to them with your whole force&#8212;also it would
be advisable to keep out a few <persName>spies </persName>close round the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>
codstantly&#8212;least there should be some other small parties of <persName>Indians</persName>
hid in the brush&#8212;I make these suggestions as my opinion of the
best course to pursue, but being on the spot you ought to be more
capable of judging what steps are necessary and will consequently
use your own discretion as regards this particular or any other 
circumstances in the business&#8212;I am obliged to meet the <persName>Committee</persName>
on the <date when="1824-06-16">16th</date> at <placeName><persName>Col. Groce</persName>s</placeName> who were appointd at the Genl. Meeting
on the <date when="1824-06-05">5th of this Month</date> to finish that business, and on the <date when="1824-06-20">20.</date> 
intend starting <persName>John Austin</persName> and <persName>Kennedy </persName>to <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> to 
accompany the <persName>Political chief of the <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> to this Place, in order to
Sign and complete the deeds for the <persName>Settlers </persName>so that it will be 
impossible for me to go to your Section of the Country at this time
without neglecting other matters of great importance to the <persName>Settlers</persName>.</p>

<p>Should you lack <persName>officers </persName>as you probably will you must make 
temporary appointments for the trip, of <persName>Lieutenants</persName>, <persName>Sergents </persName>and 
<persName>Corporals</persName>, taking care to consult the wishes of the men so as not to
create any dissatisfaction&#8212;</p>

<p>[Stephen F. Austin.]</p>

<p>[Captain Amos Rawls]</p>
