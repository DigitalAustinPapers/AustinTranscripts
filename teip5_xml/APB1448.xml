<p><placeName>Pine Bluff Trinity</placeName> <date when="1827-10-14">14th Octbr 1827</date>.</p>
<p><persName>Mr. James B. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Sir Inclosed you will receive a rough <placeName>map </placeName>of that part of the
<placeName>Province of Texas</placeName> lying <placeName>between the Trinity and Sabine</placeName>, <placeName>Bound
north by the St Antonio road,</placeName> and <placeName>south by the gulf</placeName> The following
remarks will serve in some measure to explain it.<pb n="1699"/></p>

<p><placeName>From the San Antonio crossing of the Atoyac to its June- Course and distance.
tion with Angeline_</placeName>___________________ S 00°    &#8212;21 Mile</p>

<p><placeName>from Nacogdoches to the Junction of Toyac and Angeline</placeName>____S 44° E&#8212;35 m</p>

<p><placeName>from  said  junction  to  the  Junction  of  the  Angeline  and
Naches__</placeName>_____________________________S 16° E&#8212;26 m</p>

<p><placeName>from thence to Sabine lake</placeName>_______________________._ S 13° E&#8212;51m</p>

<p><placeName>from thence to the pass in the Gulf</placeName>___________________S 20° E&#8212;16 m</p>

<p><placeName>from thence through the pass__</placeName>__________________________S 18° E&#8212; 9 m</p>

<p>The width of the <placeName>creeks </placeName>are laid down in yards <placeName>opposite the mouth
of each creek</placeName> where the width could be ascertained. Their length
and general course could not be correctly ascertained. Their 
appearance on the <placeName>map </placeName>will perhaps be the best criterion. The width also,
of some of the <placeName>rivers </placeName>are laid down in yards at different points</p>

<p>For further information I must refer you to the <placeName>Map</placeName>, which is
laid down upon a scale of ten miles to an inch English measure.
The marginal lines will aid you as to the <placeName>cardinal points</placeName></p>

<p>I have not been able to learn anything that could be relied on
relative to the <placeName>waters of the San Jacinto.</placeName></p>

<p>The <placeName>Sabine</placeName>, <placeName>Sabine lake</placeName>, <placeName>pass into the gulf</placeName> and the <placeName>coast </placeName>on to
<placeName>point Bolivar</placeName> and also <placeName>Trinity Bay</placeName> so far as it is laid down, 
together with <placeName>creeks </placeName>puting in has been laid down according to 
instructions recd from <persName>Cap1 Orr</persName> who has navigated these waters</p>

<p>The <placeName><persName>Indians </persName>Vills </placeName>have been laid down partly from my own
acquaintance with the geography of the <placeName>country </placeName>and partly by
information from <persName>Capt Orr</persName>, <persName>Mr Nash</persName>, and a <persName>Coshata Indian</persName> <placeName>From
the St Antonio crossing of the Atoyac down the Angeline Naches</placeName>,
and the <placeName>Sabine lake</placeName> has been laid down by my own observation as
I decended these waters last <date n="03-xx-1827">March</date>, but without compass or 
mathematical instruments <persName>Capt Orr</persName>, however, and others who are 
acquainted with these waters have agreed with me in the general
course and distances as laid down together with <placeName>creeks </placeName>The names
of some of these <placeName>creeks </placeName>could not be ascertained consequently they
were left blank I have no doubt but there are other <placeName>creeks </placeName>puting
in which I did not discover, as the waters were very high at the
time I came down. The <placeName>Trinity </placeName>is laid down from the best 
information the <persName>inhabitants </persName>can give. But no doubts many <placeName>creeks </placeName>are
omitted.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the <placeName>map </placeName>which is inclosed is far from being
perfect, The want of correct information from the <placeName>non inhabited
parts of the country</placeName>&#8212;the lack of mathematical instruments when
I decended the <placeName>Naches </placeName>and the little reliance to be put upon the
report of <persName>hunters </persName>and <persName>Indians </persName>to whom I have been compelled to<pb n="1700"/>
apply renders it impossible for a <placeName>map </placeName>to be perfect when founded
upon such vague data. But we must content ourselves with 
probabilities when certainties are wanting.</p>
