<p><placeName>Mexico</placeName>, <date when="1822-05-25">May 25, 1822</date>.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Having become a <persName>citizen of this <placeName>Empire</placeName></persName>, by the formation of a
settlement of <persName>three hundred families</persName> from the <placeName>United States of
America</placeName> in the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>, under authority from the <persName>Depu-<pb n="519"/>
tation in the <placeName>Internal Provinces</placeName></persName>; and participating in the Sentiments
of joy manifested by the <placeName>nation </placeName>at the recent political change, I
respectfully approach his <persName>Imperial Majesty</persName>, and offer my 
congratulations on the happy consummation of the independence of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
by the election of the <persName>hero of Iguala</persName>, the <persName>Liberator of his Country</persName>
to the Imperial Throne&#8212;</p>

<p>I make a tender of my services, my loyalty, and my fidelity to the
<persName>Constitutional Emperor of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName>; a tender which I am ready to
verify by an oath of allegiance to the <placeName>Empire</placeName>.</p>

<p>This solemn act cuts me off from all protection or dependence on
my former <persName>government</persName>&#8212;my property, my prospects, my future
hopes of happiness, for myself and <persName>family</persName>, and for the <persName>families </persName>I
have brought with me, are centered here&#8212; This is our <placeName>adopted
Nation</placeName>:&#8212;We look to the Sovereign Congress as the pure fountain
whence those blessings are to flow which will diffuse peace, 
improvement, intelligence, and happiness over this new born <placeName>Nation</placeName>:</p>

<p>We raise our eyes and hearts to him, whose virtues have elevated
him to the station he merited, as the Father, who is to distribute
those blessings to his people with a firm, impartial, and benevolent
hand&#8212;</p>

<p>I therefore supplicate that his <persName>Imperial Majesty</persName> will have the
goodness to take the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>I have formed under his 
protection, and that we be may be received as <persName>Children of the great 
Mexican family</persName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>I have the honor of presenting Your <persName>Excellency </persName>with a Copy
of my Memorial now before <persName>Congress</persName>, and also the translation
of a letter from <persName>General Wilkinson</persName>, which, in addition to the fact
that I am actually settled in <placeName>Texas </placeName>with my property and <persName>family</persName>,
and to the recommendations afforded by the documents already
before the <persName>Government </persName>relative to my <placeName>settlement</placeName>, will I hope be
deemed a sufficient proof that I come to this <placeName>Empire </placeName>in good faith,
and with a firm determination to be obedient to the established
authorities of the <persName>Government</persName>, and a wish to be useful to the nation
so far as I am able&#8212;</p>

<p>Will Your <persName>Excellency </persName>have the goodness to lay this letter and
accompanying papers before his <persName>Imperial Majesty</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Hoping that Your Excellency may find me deserving of your 
protection and Esteem.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>To <persName>His Excellency José M. Herrera Minister of State</persName> etc.</p>
