<p>Half an hour since we were attacked by the <persName>enimy</persName>, who were repulsed,
after a few fires being exchanged</p>

<p>Only a few men were seen&#8212;say about fifty&#8212;tho, from the dust etc. it is
believed 200 or more, were in the <persName>company</persName>&#8212;<persName>Dr Archer</persName> says that <persName>Col.
Ugartichea</persName> was the <persName>commandant</persName>, as he plainly saw him, and recognised
him&#8212;The place is in a good condition, or can be made so in an hour, for
defence, and until we know, of the advance of some aid, or what was 
intended by this feint, we will continue to occupy this <placeName>station</placeName>, where we have
provisions enough for the army provided means are supplied to purchase</p>

<p>Our <persName>forces </persName>are too few to hold it, and <hi rend="italic">devide</hi>, so as to do effective 
service&#8212; Will you communicate with us and inform us what we may rely on&#8212;
We are decidedly of the opinion, that this is an important <placeName>post </placeName>for the <persName>army
of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>&#8212; Let us know if you have recd our two dispatches by <persName>Black </persName>and
<persName>Smith</persName>, and whether you approve of our movements etc. If you do, and
can spare the fifty <persName>men</persName>&#8212;or the <persName>2d Division of the 1st. Batalion</persName>, fowd them,
and your orders etc as to the movements etc and what <placeName>post</placeName>, to cooperate
with yours, we should take&#8212; We should have marched in half an hour
to the <placeName>timber</placeName>, with [in]  <placeName>3/4 mile ofBexar</placeName>, and shall yet do so, when we
hear from you&#8212; Please advise us as to provisions etc and the <hi rend="italic">means </hi>to 
purchase and supply the same&#8212;and fowd our portion of flour etc. recd- from
<placeName>Goliad </placeName>and <placeName>elsewhere</placeName>&#8212; Permit us to again suggest&#8212;<hi rend="italic">nay urge</hi>, the 
propriety&#8212; the <hi rend="italic">necessity </hi>of some movement, which will bring us <hi rend="italic">nearer 
together, and shut in the <persName>enemy</persName></hi>, and either starve them out, whip them out,
or dishearten and beat them in small parties, in all of which, our <hi rend="italic">two<pb n="207"/>
parties may agree on an hour</hi> and cooperate with each other, and never
fail of success etc</p>
