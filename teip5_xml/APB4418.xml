<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I Recd. Inteligence to day that the party of <persName>Indians </persName>that killed
<persName>Reed </persName>has been defeated there were 8 off them they were <persName>Wacos </persName>a
<persName>Hunting party</persName> on <placeName>Little River</placeName> Consisting of 2 <persName>Mexicans </persName>2 <persName>Delewas
Indians</persName> 2 <persName>Caddoes </persName>and 2 <persName>anadarkas </persName>were the <persName>party </persName>that defeated
them Killed 5 Brot in the Scalps of 2 and says the other three
were killed in <placeName>Little River</placeName> and Sunk they Brot in <persName>Reed</persName>s Horse
and saddle and deliverd to <persName>Reeds Farther</persName> the people above has
appointed<persName> Company officers</persName> the appointment has not been as good
as might have been But to place them in a Still Better situation
appoint Some <persName>civil officer</persName> among them this is what the thinking
Class of men among them think Best, they are willing to be 
governed by any thing that you say and It is vary Importt to keep them
together up there I think that <persName>Frances Smith</persName> wood make the Best
<persName>civil officer </persName>Because he is more Interested and wood doo more to
sustane the place and to keep order a Line from you saying that
<persName>Smith </persName>shall be the Civill officer among them wood be all Sufficient
If you doo not think proper Let the <persName>Ayuto </persName>doo it. But an order
from you wood be all sufficient and wood be more Respected than
anything the <persName>Auyto </persName>cood doo</p>

<p>10 <persName>men </persName>starts from here this <date when="1832-08-24">evening </date>to join the <persName>people </persName>up there
and to Remain with them untill other arrangements can be made
or untill the appearance of Danger subsides It is all Important
to sustain them people above for If they Break up the whole
<placeName>country above the Yeawa</placeName>, and perhaps <placeName>above the Navasott</placeName> wood be
abandoned</p>
