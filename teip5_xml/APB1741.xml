<p><placeName>Veracrus </placeName><date when="1829-07-28">28 July 1829</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Various have been our fortunes since we met and parted in
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;   You remember that this was then as it still is, my post,<pb n="242"/>
at which, I have ever since resided&#8212;Save occasionally a tour into the
<placeName>interior</placeName>, or a trip to the <placeName>States </placeName>I have heard of the progress of
your <placeName>Settlement </placeName>which I consider to be too firmly rooted, to be easily
or readily eradicated&#8212; I have not forgotten your invitation to me
to settle in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;- After which I have always had a kind of
<hi rend="italic">hankering </hi>my present <hi rend="italic">object </hi>is to obtain a small grant of from Fifty
to one hundred to embrace both sides of some <placeName>water course</placeName>, with due
attention to soil, wood, and water, as I have a number of <persName>friends</persName>
whom I could induce to move out, and who would form no 
inconsiderable acquisitions to your <hi rend="italic">infant </hi>State&#8212;but I can do nothing&#8212;
viz will attempt nothing without your <hi rend="italic">aid </hi>and <hi rend="italic">advice</hi>. What I would
have you to do for me in this business is, to select Me <placeName>tracts </placeName>of country&#8212;
draw the plot with the boundaries etc. and to furnish me with your
advice as to the Measures to be taken by me in order to secure the
Grant. All which, from your local Knowledge of the <placeName>County</placeName>, may
be done in your <placeName>office</placeName>.</p>

<p>please write to me thru <persName>Messrs Jas. W. Zackerie</persName> and <persName>Co N. orls</persName>
as well as under Care to the <persName>Honorable J. E. Poinsett Envdo Extrary
Min. Píen, de <placeName>Los E. E. U. U. de America</placeName></persName>&#8212;<placeName>Mexico </placeName>provided thro'
this latter channel I could expect to hear from you in any reasonable
time&#8212; perhaps it were better to send both original and Dupls Via <placeName>N.
orls</placeName>&#8212; my intention is to leave this part of <placeName>Mexico </placeName>next <date n="Winter - 1829">winter</date>, and
therefore am the more anxious to hear from you soon</p>

<p><persName>W. Taylor</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<persName>Troops </persName>in the expectation of being attacked by an <persName>expedition </persName>sd to
have recently left the <placeName>Hava </placeName>but that expedn must be detined else
where.</p>
