<p>Dear Sir I am informed that <persName>Capt Carrico </persName>has taken a part of a
bail of Domestick from <placeName>on board of the Schooner</placeName> wrapt in his Bed
and a part of it in his trunk Say about 300 yds also has taken the long
Boat <placeName>on shore</placeName> and top Sail which was all under execution I am
informd the <persName>guard </persName>dont know of the domestick being gone and
before the trial they Sent off 5 barrels of flower and one of whiskey
this will show to you that they are making way with their property
to avoid the payment of their just debts and I wish to decide as
quick as possible and if you confirm the judgment I wish you to order
the <persName>Captains </persName>to be brought forward under execution and hired out
to pay the balance of the debt and cost of them should there be a
Balance as I find that to be the law I find it impossible to get a
<persName>guard </persName>to doo their duty as they dont [like?]it they wont do as they
are directed we are all kept here litterally speaking in a State of<pb n="1122"/>
starvation without Bread and waiting to get our rights, I came to
cultivate the Soil and the Season is fast expiring that we can be
benefited by it,&#8212;this will be handed you by a <persName>coloured man </persName>which
was <persName>Steward </persName><placeName>on board of the Schooner </placeName>and you can ask him about
what I have stated.</p>

<p><persName>Jesse H. Cartwright</persName>    [Rubric]</p>
<p>P S there is one Barrel of flower <placeName>on board </placeName>and we intend to make
use of it&#8212;</p>

<p>Please to send me an answer by the first opportunity and oblige
yours</p>
