<p><placeName>City of Mexico</placeName>, <date when="1822-08-06">Aug. 6, 1822</date>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir&#8212;I wrote you a few days since by <persName>Mr. De Armos</persName> who
accompanied <persName>Col. Erwin</persName> through by land.   At the time I wrote that<pb n="536"/>
letter, some strange rumors were in circulation as to the state of 
affairs here; but I am happy in assuring you they turned out to be
entirely false. Things are more tranquil; the <persName>Congress </persName>progressing
in their deliberations, and appearances justify the conclusion, that
whatever be the collision arising from difference in opinion as to
the course this government should pursue it is gradually gaining
strength, and will, I trust, ultimately secure the end of all 
government, the happiness of the people. As I mentioned in a former 
letter, business was all suspended for the ceremonies of the most 
splendid coronation which perhaps any age has furnished. <persName>Congress </persName>have
resumed their labors with some asciduity. The colonization law is
now printing and will be finally discussed and disposed of in eight
or ten days. I will forward a copy the moment it passes. There is
a section in it which embraces my case, and without some unexpected
opposition or difficulty, I hope to have my claim fully confirmed, and
be on my way to the <placeName>settlement </placeName>at all events in fifteen or twenty days,
I shall however, not leave this until my <placeName>land claim</placeName> is finally 
adjusted ; and although I am aware the <persName>settlers </persName>have experienced much
inconvenience by my absence, still in the end my visit here will not
be without advantages to the settlement.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin.</persName></p>
