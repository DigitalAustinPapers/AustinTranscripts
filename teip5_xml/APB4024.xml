<p>My Valued Friend I have been in this place for sometime 
waiting on the vessel, which is promised freight&#8212; I calculate to sail in
a few days,</p>

<p>I was Kindly received In this place by <persName>General Terran</persName>, <persName>Col 
Bradburn </persName>and others,</p>

<p>We Expect to be full of <persName>Troops </persName>for the<placeName> Trinity Station</placeName>, <persName>Col. 
Bradburn</persName>, the <persName>Commander </persName>etc&#8212;with whom I am pleased <persName>General 
Terran</persName> will march by land, shortly,</p>

<p><placeName>Texas </placeName>begins to Excite Much Interest It appears to me, and many
think with me, that It must be aplace, of Peace and Safety&#8212;
Considering the great difficulties in the Government&#8212; I have positively
stated our faithfulness towards the Government, and that there is
nothing to fear from the <persName>Americans</persName>, Provided they Are believed,
And not Imposed upon&#8212;we are Viewed with a Jealous Eye, In
<placeName>Texas </placeName>Owing to the Jealousy of <placeName>England</placeName>, I have seen a<placeName> New York
paper</placeName>, Containing the debates in <placeName>Parliarment</placeName>, By <persName>Huskisson Bearing
Peal</persName>, and others&#8212;who toutch hard on us&#8212;Calling us <persName>squatters</persName>.
Turbulent, and an ungovernable sett&#8212;and show the <persName>United States</persName>,
as Reaching for the <placeName>Country</placeName>&#8212; I hope you have or will see the
papers&#8212; But Sir we are safe, in <placeName>Texas </placeName>Only let the <persName>Cittizens </persName>be
true to their Contracts, notwithstanding, the Jealouses of the 
Governments&#8212;</p>

<p>I now Sir, before I close ask a favour of you. <hi rend="italic">It is this</hi>, a <persName>Mrs
Reed, of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></persName> was pleased with the discription which others
and myself gave her of <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Texas </placeName></hi>she, agreed and vissitted. In <date n="07-xx-1830">July
last</date>&#8212;and Intended to have seen you--but understanding you was
not <placeName>home </placeName>she declined&#8212;   her Intention was to get land, and as she
has a <persName>family </persName>and will be a Valuable <persName>Cittizen</persName>, I ask for her,<pb n="483"/>
She stated to me, that she had written to you on the Subject&#8212;
she is On her way to <placeName>Orleans</placeName>&#8212;for the purpose of arranging her
Buisness for a permanent removal, She wishes, If possible to have
<placeName>land </placeName>located Imediately in some good place&#8212; or so that she can be
certain of It&#8212; She may probably marry in <placeName>Orleans </placeName>or here&#8212;and
then she would loose, what was her great wish&#8212;land&#8212; any thing
you can do for<persName> Mrs Reed</persName> will Indeed greatly oblige me as I am 
perhaps the cause of her removal, she has many <persName>friends </persName>and I have no
doubt you will be pleased&#8212; I hope you are well and all my
<persName>friends</persName>&#8212; And the <placeName>Colony </placeName>in a state of prosperity which is the
truest wishes of my heart</p>
