<p><placeName>City of Mexico</placeName> <date when="1822-11-22">November 22nd 1822</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>When I arrived here <persName>Congress </persName>were sitting but progressing
very slowly, the discord and jealousy manifested from the first day
of the session of <persName>Congress </persName>against the <persName>Generalissimo Iturbide</persName> (now
<persName>Emperor</persName>) was increasing daily and everything was at a stand -
There were three distinct <persName>parties in Congress</persName>, one for a <persName>Bourbon
King</persName>, one for an <persName>Emperor </persName>from this country, and the other for a
<persName>Republic</persName>, in this state of things the <persName>government </persName>was approximating
towards Anarchy, when on the night of the <date when="1822-05-18">18 of May</date> the <persName>army</persName>
stationed in this city proclaimed <persName>Iturbide Emperor</persName>, the next day
<persName>Congress </persName>elected him in due form and on the <date when="1822-05-21">21</date> he took the oath,
these things put a stop to all business for some time - Agreeably to
the <persName>Emperor</persName>s Oath he could do nothing without the consent of 
<persName>Congress </persName>and this body moved most astonishingly slow and were more
occupied in watching the <persName>Emperor </persName>than in attending to the interest
of the country - On the <date when="1822-07-21">21 July</date> the <persName>Emperor </persName>was crowned, and
very soon after serious collisions began to arise between him and
<persName>Congress</persName>, the latter wished to keep all power in their hands and
things were getting worse every day all was at a dead stand, for
<persName>Congress </persName>would do nothing for fear of granting a little power to
the <persName>executive</persName>, and the <persName>Emperor </persName>could do nothing so long as 
<persName>Congress </persName>existed without its sanction - In this state of things it was in
vain for an individual to urge his business, however important and
mine with all other individual applications was laid on one side&#8212;
Matters progressed in this manner from bad to worse and were
again verging towards Anarchy; one dangerous conspiracy was 
discovered and quelled by the imprisonment of about 70, amongst whom
were 20 <persName>members of Congress</persName> and at length finding that nothing
but an extraordinary and desicive step could save the nation from
the confusion and the established government from ruin, the 
<persName>Emperor </persName>desolved <persName>congress </persName>by a decree of his own on the <date when="1822-10-31">31 of October</date>
last and created a national <persName>Junta </persName>of his own choosing from amongst<pb n="555"/>
the <persName>members of Congress</persName> - since then things have gone on better
and with more harmony - My business relative to the <placeName>settlement </placeName>is
now acting on and in less than 10 days I shall be dispatched with
everything freely arranged. The principal difficulty is slavery, this
they will not admit - as the law is all <persName>slaves </persName>are to be free in ten
years, but I am trying to have it amended so as to make them <persName>slaves</persName>
for life and their <persName>children </persName>free at 21 years - but do not think I shall
succeed in this point, and that the law will pass as it now is, that is,
that the <persName>slaves </persName>introduced by the <persName>settlers </persName>shall be free after 10
years - As regards all other matters there will be no difficulty, I will
write you again from here after I get through and let you know
the particulars. I am doubtful nothing can be done about getting
land at or near <placeName>Galveston</placeName>, the <persName>government </persName>seems opposed to any 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>being formed so near the <placeName>borders of the United States</placeName>, when
I return to <placeName>Texas </placeName>I will write you very fully - you must not be
frightened at the name of an <persName>Imperial government</persName>, you like myself
have lived under a Monarchy, when <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>belonged to <placeName>Spain </placeName>and
I think we lived as happy then as under the <persName>government of the
<placeName>United States</placeName></persName> - The <persName>Emperor </persName>has his <persName>enemies </persName>and in the <placeName>United States</placeName>
the <persName>Democrats </persName>will abuse him no doubt, but he is doing the best for
his country. These people will not do for a <persName>Republic </persName>nothing but a
Monarchy can save them from Anarchy -</p>
