<p><placeName>Monterrey </placeName><date when="1823-05-20">May 20. 1823</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I have been here several days wating for the <persName>Comt Genl</persName> who is
expected this evening. I shall probably start in three or four days
after his arrival and hope to embrace you once more in a short time.</p>

<p>I have written to the <persName>Junta Governativa</persName> and to the <persName>Baron </persName>
informing them of my arrival thus far and I wish you to send notice 
thereof to the <persName>settlers </persName>as I am told they are very much discouraged and
that many talk of returning back&#8212;It will be an unfortunate event
for the whole <placeName>Province </placeName>if this <placeName>settlement </placeName>is broken up, and I think
it would have a good effect on the minds of the <persName>settlers </persName>if the <persName>Junta</persName>
could publish my letter to them, but say nothing of this to any one
except the <persName>Baron </persName>or <persName>Erasmo</persName>. I am told you have a <placeName>newspaper </placeName>in
<placeName>Bexar </placeName>which I am rejoiced to hear it will be of incalculable 
advantage to <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and the whole <placeName>Province</placeName>&#8212;I have no company but
one <persName>servant</persName>, and if I meet with none at <placeName>Laredo </placeName>shall go through with
him for I am so anxious to get home that nothing shall detain me&#8212;
The <placeName>country </placeName>is parched with the drought and corn very high&#8212;
the <persName>people </persName>in this quarter are all in favor of a <placeName>Federal Republic</placeName> I
hope <placeName>Bexar </placeName>is the same a <placeName>Central Republic </placeName>is the worst Govt in
the world&#8212;for all the power will be in the hands of a few men in
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>and instead of a <placeName>Republic </placeName>it will in effect be an <placeName>aristocracy</placeName>
which is worse than a <placeName>monarchy</placeName>, for in it we shall have 100 <persName>Tyrants</persName><pb n="645"/>
instead of one, I do not wish to take an active part in politics, but
if I can do anything in favour of the confederate system, I will do
so with pleasure&#8212;In the <placeName>city of Mexico</placeName> and everywhere else where
there are <persName>Fryars </persName>this system will be opposed those miserable drones
are the <persName>enemies </persName>of liberty, of human happiness and of the human
race&#8212;their <persName>converts </persName>instead of being consecrated to the sacred and
immaculate religion they profess are dens of "corruption, of 
intrigue, of infamy and vice&#8212;there never was a people so dreadfully
priestridden and enslaved by superstition and fanaticism as the
great part of this nation The <persName>clergy </persName>literally suck the blood of
the unfortunate people&#8212;will the great God of Justice and of truth,
will the lights of the age, permit such horrible abuses to exist much
longer? No&#8212;<placeName>Mexico </placeName>has recoverd her civil liberty&#8212;She will soon
assume her rights in full, and bursting the chains of superstition
declare that <hi rend="italic">man has a right to think for himself.</hi></p>

<p>Farewell may we soon meet in happiness remember me to all
<persName>friends</persName></p>
