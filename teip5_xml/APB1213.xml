<p><date when="1826-07-30">30th July 1826</date> &#8212;</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I came here this <date when="1826-07-30">morning</date>&#8212;your <persName>brother </persName>has just left&#8212;
I shall over take him <date when="1826-07-31">tomorrow</date>.   <persName>Dewitt </persName>is in the <placeName>bay or bacca</placeName>&#8212;<pb n="1391"/>
Several of the people <persName>resident </persName>of the <placeName>fort </placeName>are now here&#8212; I have
endeavored to ascertain, there intentions&#8212;They will no doubt leave
the place before the <date when="1826-08-31">last of next month</date>&#8212;They will I believe all or
nearly so go below&#8212;In that case this will be an out side, and I even
doubt whether this place will be occupied long after the <placeName>fort </placeName>breaks&#8212;.</p>

<p>I am somewhat of the opinion that were you to write to <persName>Capt.
Burnham</persName> and invite him to see you; and you would give him some
indulgence in the price and payment of his land that probiblely he
would stop here, and station,&#8212;should he do so it will Induce others
to stop also.</p>

<p>This however is conjecture on my part.&#8212;tho I think it merits some
consideration.</p>

<p>Those people have now growing crops that they flattered 
themselves would turn in to there acts, sufficient funds to pay the balanse
due to you&#8212;and under the present circumstances it is not likely
that they will realize one Dollar&#8212;by them. They are poor and
have <persName>familys </persName>and the loss of a crop is to them a serious thing.</p>

<p>As I have mearly sugested the subject to you for your 
consideration ; I hope you will excuse the freedom I have taken</p>

<p><persName>James Kerr</persName></p>
<p>P. S. I would not be understood, as giving to <persName>Capt Burnham</persName> 
Indulgences that could not be extended to all eaqual meritorious&#8212;but
to consult with him as a kind of <persName>forman</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Sn felipe De Austin</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Mr. Woods</persName></p>

<p>Since I sealed this I have recd a mesage from <persName>Colo Dewitt</persName>&#8212;He is
off the <placeName>mouth of the vacca</placeName>&#8212;and is afraid to land on account of the
<persName>Indians </persName>that are in the <placeName>neighbourhood</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have therefore to repair to his Assistance Immediately</p>

<p>______                                         <persName>JK</persName></p>
