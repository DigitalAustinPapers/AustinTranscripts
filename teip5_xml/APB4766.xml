<p>[From the Williams Papers. Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas.]</p>
<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1835-04-15">15 April 1835</date></p>

<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>I am still here, a <persName>prisoner on bail</persName>&#8212; nothing has taken place in my 
situation since the <date when="1834-12-25">25 day of December</date>, when I was released from <placeName>close 
confinement</placeName> on bail&#8212;</p>

<p>I make no calculations when I shall leave or whether I shall return by
land or water&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>legislature at <placeName>Monclova</placeName></persName> has involved matters in a beautiful tangle
by the cursed law authorizing the <persName>Govr</persName>- to dispose of <placeName>400 leagues of land
</placeName>as he pleases. I fear this law will [ere] ate much more discontent in
<placeName>Texas </placeName>[tha]n anything which has happened&#8212; nothing could have been
more imprudent&#8212; It will produce restrictions and in short everything bad
that can be imagined&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>senator of that State</persName> is a faithful defender of his state and a firm
one, but all he gains or can gain by trying to defend such a measure as
this, is to ruin himself in public opinion here and loose all influence<pb n="63"/></p>

<p>I hope they have had sense enough at <placeName>Monclova </placeName>to take no part in the
civil war that seems to be commencing&#8212; Keep out of such things&#8212; If
<persName>Durste </persName>and <persName>Carbajal </persName>voted for the 400 league law&#8212;tell them to remember
<hi rend="italic">what kind of constituents</hi> they have and to be more cautious in future,&#8212;
That law will cause discontent in <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Genl Santana</persName> leaves <date when="1835-04-18">in three days</date> for the <placeName>interior </placeName><placeName>(Zacatecas)</placeName> he 
informed me <date when="1835-04-14">yesterday </date>that he should visit <placeName>Texas </placeName>and take me with him,
after these other matters are settled&#8212; He is very friendly to <placeName>Texas </placeName>and it
would be an advantage to that <placeName>country </placeName>if he would pay it a visit</p>

<p>I do not write home by this mail, so you can send this to them, and say
that I beg of them all to have nothing to do with the politics of this
<placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;I mean the present civil dissentions&#8212;a dead silence a dead calm
as to these family quarrels is the only proper course for <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I know nothing of what is going on at <placeName>Monclova</placeName>, nor of your opinions
about these matters&#8212;but feel confident they are similar to mine&#8212; I am
decidedly of the opinion that the federal system is in no danger at present&#8212;
There will be some change, but not a radical one&#8212; This is my opinion</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>Mr. S. M. Williams</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <placeName>(Coahuila)</placeName> <persName>D. Samuel M. Williams</persName> <placeName>Monclova</placeName></p>
