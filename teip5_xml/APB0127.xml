<p><persName>St. Louis</persName> <date when="1807-09-12">Sep 12 1807</date></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have delayed very long to answer your letter of the <date when="1807-08-02">2d of Aug</date>,-
neither do I know at this moment, in what manner it should be
answered.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally agreed that you and <persName>Col° Smith</persName> have been
at the head of the two great <persName>parties</persName>, which have heretofore divided
the district of <placeName>St Genevieve</placeName>.&#8212; Your opponent has been dismissed<pb n="138"/>
from office with as much abruptness as the decorums of such a 
measure would justify; and it appeared to me correct and proper, that
your several friends, should be no longer known, as the <persName>partizans </persName>of
their respective <persName>leaders</persName>.</p>

<p>With respect to the disaffection of certain <persName>persons in your <placeName>quarter
of the Country</placeName></persName>, you must be very sensible&#8212;that I have no proofs.</p>

<p>The conduct of <persName>Colo, S------</persName>has been before the <persName>Grand Jury</persName>&#8212; Against
him there were stronger presumptions than against others, and yet
nothing was established.</p>

<p>When a <persName>Public Agent</persName> proscribes a <persName>Citizen </persName>and declares him 
unworthy of public trust the world will expect to be told of what he
has been guilty.&#8212; I have nothing but the surmises of 
[undecipherable] <persName>enemies </persName>to offer.&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Major Cook</persName> has been with me&#8212;He recriminates, tho' he knows
nothing of your accusations&#8212;but permit me to assure you, that I
entertain the same high opinions of your purity of character and
conduct that I ever did&#8212;</p>

<p>With respect to a <persName>Legionary Corps</persName>&#8212;I approve the idea, and
should certainly be gratified by sanctioning such an arrangements&#8212;
but it cannot at this time be carried into effect, It shall not be 
forgotten</p>

<p><persName>Mr. James Austin</persName> is so fully possessed of my feelings on these
subjects that he will carry them to you more satisfactorily than I
have now leisure to do&#8212;</p>

<p>F<persName>rederick: Bates</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Moses Austin Esquire</persName> <placeName>Mine a Burton</placeName>, <persName>Jas. Austin
Esquire</persName></p>
