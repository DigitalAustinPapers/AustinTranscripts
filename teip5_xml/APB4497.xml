<p><placeName>Montgomery. Alabama.</placeName> <date when="1832-12-19">Dec. 19th. 1832</date></p>
<p>Hon Sir,</p>

<p>I have been requested by a number of respectable <persName>Planters </persName>in this
vicinity, to solicit from you by letter, such information as prudent
minds deem necessary, before determining on an emigration to your<pb n="907"/>
<placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;this request I hope will be an ample apology for the 
freedom I take in addressing you&#8212;</p>

<p>The inquiries I am asked to make, are simply these&#8212;</p>

<p>1st. What is the precise <hi rend="italic">quantum </hi>of land, which a <persName><hi rend="italic">planter </hi></persName>may depend on receiving as an inducement to become a <persName>citizen of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>?</p>

<p>2nd. Will he be allowed to <hi rend="italic">select </hi>pieces or <placeName>parcels of land</placeName>, from
any <placeName>Section </placeName>not otherwise disposed of?</p>

<p>3rd. The <hi rend="italic">expense </hi>requisite to <hi rend="italic">secure </hi>to himself, a <hi rend="italic">legal </hi>and 
<hi rend="italic">indisputable title</hi> to such land, as under the <hi rend="italic">established provisions</hi> he
may take?</p>

<p>4th. Can a man, bringing <hi rend="italic">Capital </hi>into the <placeName>country </placeName>purchase land,
<hi rend="italic">adjoining </hi>that, granted by <hi rend="italic">Government</hi>?</p>

<p>5th. What distinction is made, as regards <hi rend="italic">quantity </hi>of land, between
<persName>planters </persName><hi rend="italic">with</hi>, and <persName>planters </persName><hi rend="italic">without</hi>, <persName>families</persName>?</p>

<p>6th. Do your laws affect the <hi rend="italic">tenure </hi>of <persName><hi rend="italic">Slave </hi></persName>property&#8212;if so, what is best method of avoiding such <hi rend="italic">inconvenience</hi>:</p>

<p>7th. Must a <persName><hi rend="italic">planter</hi></persName>, previous to opening land sufficient to afford
subsistence for his <persName><hi rend="italic">family</hi></persName>, pay for food, clothing and other 
necessaries, an <hi rend="italic">extravagant </hi>price?</p>

<p>8th, Have you <hi rend="italic">good <placeName>schools </placeName>for the education of <persName>children</persName></hi>?</p>

<p>9th. What is the cheapest, most expeditious and <hi rend="italic">secure </hi>route <placeName>from
Alabama to your Colony</placeName>&#8212;and can wagons pass conveniently from
<hi rend="italic">here</hi>, there?</p>

<p>10th. Are its <hi rend="italic">soil </hi>and <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, as rich and good (in your opinion)
as the soil and climate of <placeName>Alabama </placeName>or <placeName>Mississippi </placeName>?</p>

<p>The many extravagant and <hi rend="italic">contradictory </hi>accounts of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, now
afloat in this <placeName>country</placeName>, are cause of such <hi rend="italic">particularity </hi>in my 
questions&#8212;for the sake of those <persName>Planters </persName>who have employed me to 
conduct this correspondence, I hope you will [be] able to glean time
sufficient from the duties to which doubtless you are pressingly
called, to answer them <hi rend="italic">fully</hi>&#8212; the facts, which in their behalf, I
seek to obtain, were they generally understood, would bring your
<placeName>colony </placeName>an accession of some of our most <hi rend="italic">sturdy </hi>and <hi rend="italic">valuable </hi> <persName>Planters</persName>&#8212;good <persName>husbands</persName>&#8212;good <persName>fathers </persName>and as a consequence, <persName><hi rend="italic">amiable
members of society</hi></persName>&#8212;Though it is not connected with the questions
asked above, I would for my <hi rend="italic">own </hi>information enquire, whether the
<persName>friends of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> can look with much certainty to a period when the
<persName>Government of that <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> shall assume a different&#8212;perhaps an
independent form&#8212;such a change would be prodigal of influence
and importance, and do more than any other measure perhaps, to
awaken the <placeName>world</placeName>, and particularly the <placeName>U. States</placeName>, to the value of its
natural resources and probable merit of its political institutions&#8212;
Should my enquiry meet your approbation, your views on this, as<pb n="908"/>
on the other subjects mentioned, will be received thankfully, and
read with intense interest&#8212;</p>

<p>As <persName>attorney for my clients</persName>, and from the esteem I have for your
character,</p>

<p><persName>A. C. AlNSWORTH</persName>.</p>

<p>P. S. Will you also inform me, what chance (if any) there is
in your settlement for a young and persevering <persName><hi rend="italic">Lawyer</hi></persName>? I am a
<persName>native of <placeName>Providence in Rhode-Island</placeName></persName>&#8212;settled in this town&#8212;as I
am so far from the " household hearth " and home's familiar voices,
already, I would not object [to] a compliance with the solicitation
of my <persName>friends </persName>to accompany them (supposing they go) if I can do
as well even, there, as I am doing now in this place.</p>

<p>Excuse these <hi rend="italic">repeated </hi>requests, and believe me,</p>

<p><persName>A. C. AINSWORTH</persName></p>

<p><persName>Hon. Austin</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Honr. Austin</persName> <persName>St Felippe De Austin Brassora Texas
</persName>Pr <persName>Mr John A Barkley</persName></p>
