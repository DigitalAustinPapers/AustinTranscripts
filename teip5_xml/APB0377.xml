<p>[About February 1, 1821.]</p>
<p>Sir&#8212;In compliance to your <persName>Excellency</persName>'s orders, I translate and
transmit to you the portions interesting to the <persName>Government</persName>, of a<pb n="381"/>
letter I have received from <persName>Moses Austin, Agent of the families of
<placeName>Louisiana </placeName>who come to settle in this <placeName>Province</placeName>.</persName></p>

<p>"<date when="1821-01-16">January 16th</date>.&#8212;I met on the <placeName>Sabine River</placeName> two <persName>Citizens of <placeName>Arkansas</placeName></persName> who
told me that through the intervention of <placeName>Russia </placeName>the " <persName>Cortes </persName>" have confirmed
the treaty of Peace with the <persName>U. S.</persName> that, the <placeName>Sabine </placeName>is the <placeName>boundary </placeName>between
the <placeName>Territories </placeName>of both Governments, that the <persName>American Congress</persName> have passed
a Law punishing, with a fine of $1000, emprisonment for one year and 
forfeiture of property, any person who shall trade with the <persName>Indians in the
<placeName>Spanish Domain</placeName></persName>; that the treaty for exchange of Lands entered into with the
<persName>Indians </persName>who lived on the <placeName>Tennessee River</placeName>, on the <placeName>East bank of the Mississippi</placeName>,
for other lands on the <placeName>Head waters of the Arkansas River</placeName>, interferes with a
great many <persName>families </persName>of <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>who have to abandon their lands by 
disposition of <persName>Congress</persName>, at the <date when="1821-05-31">end of May next</date>. They might be very available
if they could [be] allowed to settle in the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>, however, there
are also several families concerned, who will neither wait, nor apply for an
authorization, but will settle on their own authority. The <persName>Government </persName>ought
to be on its guard against them; they may prove to be dangerous.</p>

<p>"The <persName>President </persName>has sent to the <persName>Gulf </persName>two armed Frigates against <persName>Laffitte</persName>
and other <persName>Pirates</persName>; the so called <persName>General Long</persName> is on the <placeName>Continent</placeName>, near 
<placeName>Galveston </placeName>; his circumstances are rather bad.</p>

<p>" Trusting that my petition shall be favourably acted upon, I go to <placeName>Missouri</placeName>
to prepare the emigration of my <persName>family</persName>, and others who have applied to remove
to the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>. It would be proper to allow these <persName>families </persName>to 
introduce their property by the <placeName>Colorado River</placeName>, with understanding that they shall
pay such duties as the <persName>Government </persName>may impose; for myself I ask for 
permission to introduce by that route some agricultural implements and other goods,
for which I offer to pay ordinary duties."</p>
