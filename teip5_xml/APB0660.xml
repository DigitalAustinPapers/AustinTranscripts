<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I wish you to attend particularly to the enclosed and pray try
and get me all the money you can as I must have some to send for
my <persName>mother </persName>and <persName>sister</persName>&#8212;Sell the powder for $2 in cash or 250 in
shaved deer skins at 15 cents pr pound or Bees wax at 5 cents pr
pound I wish to get <persName>Capt Ga . . .</persName> [mutilated] to take care of my
colts&#8212;when you move bring down my little things that I left with
you clothe etc as far as this&#8212;</p>

<p>I thought all <persName>parties </persName>were satisfied relative to the land below
when you left here&#8212;there will be no cause for dissatisfaction&#8212;
When I first explored that part of the country two years ago I
chose two places, one on the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>and one here, the one on the
<placeName>Colorado </placeName>was occupied on my return from <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and I have given
it up and the one <placeName>on this river</placeName> is now taken by you and earner&#8212;
I am not difficult to please nor avaricious and will sacrifice my own
interests at any time in favor of those I esteem or wish to serve&#8212;
You and <persName>Varner </persName>told me there was another <placeName>creek </placeName>below the one
you chose, I am told by others that there is none and no <placeName>prairie</placeName>. I
wanted a place at the <placeName>bottom of the big Prairie</placeName> to live at and I
thought after what passed between us here that all <persName>parties </persName>were
satisfied but from what I have heard since you are dissatisfied that
I should take a quarter of a league there and have made reflections
that if it had not been for you the whole settlement would have
b[roken] etc. I will never suffer any man to lay me under an
obligation  without  more than  an  equivalent  and  shall  therefore<pb n="715"/>
not take an inch at that place if I have to drink river water you
can therefore remove as soon as you please with the assurance that
no one shall interfere with you; all I wish in future relative to
such matters is that when an understanding is once made let there
be no reflections made about it afterwards&#8212;</p>

<p>Present my respects to <persName>Mrs Bell</persName> and be assured that I am</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>J. H. Bell</persName></p>
