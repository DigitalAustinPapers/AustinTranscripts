<p><placeName>[Mou]nt Prairie [Arkansas]</placeName> <date when="1821-11-03">Nov 3d 1821</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have frequently recd letters from you in the course of the 
<date n="Summer-1821">summer</date>, but in consequence of your continually mooving situation I
defered answering untill now, on the <date when="1821-10-27">27th- Oct.</date> on my arival from
the Legislature I recd yrs of <date when="1821-11-10">10th Inst,</date> written at <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>, in
which you requested that I go on and join <persName>Mr Bell</persName> and proceed on
to survey for the <placeName>settlers</placeName>&#8212;this, be assured sir, I will attend to as
promptly as my circumstances and present situation will permit&#8212;it
is with extacy that myself and many other <persName>friends </persName>of yours hear
of your success so far, and see the vastly flattering prospects ahead<pb n="425"/>
in colonizing with enlightened and respectable <persName>citizens</persName>&#8212;that vast
<placeName>Spanish wilderness</placeName> hitherto almost unobserved and unknown&#8212;In
two weeks from this time <persName>Jas. Clark</persName> and myself with several other
mechanics etc. will set out for <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> to which place we will
make all possible speed, and if I can learn where you will land or
where you design laying off a Town I will proceed immediately to
the spot if nothing more important prevents having finished my
functions as a representative of the people I am perfectly at liberty
to undertake in any enterprize&#8212;and was extremely happy to find
such demands for me in your country I shall go on prepared with
Instruments for 2 companies of <persName>surveyors </persName>to work, I said I defered
answering until now, I forgot I wrote by Col. . . [torn] who is now
on a visit to <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Texas</placeName></hi>, but I have learned that he unfortunately did
not meet with you <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Country</hi> is all the rage in the
<placeName>southern end of the Territory</placeName> and if I could wait 2 months I have
no doubt that my company would consist of <persName>50 persons</persName>, most of
whom would intend making corn before their return If no 
interruption in government takes place, a great many of the most 
respectable farmers in this country will certainly moove immediately on to
your grant. I with the rest of your friends will do all we can to
forward emmigration. I shall take on some medicines and wish you
to buy <persName>Thomas</persName>'s practice if convenient and take it on for me, we
will attend to having your Trunk and books sent on which is at
<persName>Vaughn</persName>'s under some little imbarrisment. It is not necessary to
write much at present suffice it to say that between the <date when="1821-12-10">10th </date>and
<date when="1821-12-15">15th of Decr</date> I will be at <placeName>St Antonio</placeName> and on the <date when="1821-12-25">25th</date> could be at the
<placeName>coast </placeName>if necessary&#8212;I write now in order to let you know that I will
certainly be in your country that you may know how to make any
arangements that may depend on me&#8212;I wish to get imploy if any
there is both for myself and some other young men who will go on
with me&#8212;We will meet if God . . . [permits]. [I will then] have
a full opportunity [of talking to you] on matters of moment 
[Permit me] to present the good wishes of a large [Majori?]ty of our
county&#8212;also those with deep sencerity of</p>

<p><persName>R. Andrews</persName>    [Rubric]</p>
<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Hon. Stephen F Austin Esqr</persName>   Late of <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, now
