<p><placeName>Bells </placeName><date when="1830-12-10">Decr 10, [1830] Saturday</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p>I received yours of<date when="1830-12-06"> 6th</date> today&#8212; I am much pleased to learn from
you that the subject I offered to your Consideration had been 
receiving it before&#8212;   It argued me at least, not a <hi rend="italic">lone </hi>dreamer&#8212;</p>

<p>I shall be much gratified some future day to talk it over with
you at our Convenience.</p>

<p>You observe the <placeName><hi rend="italic">" Main Spring "</hi></placeName> has brought me quite promptly
to accept your influence for a League of Land, " Hombre Soltero "
tho' I am&#8212;</p>

<p>I should in the event of the petitions succeding like to have it
located on the <placeName>Karankaway (the East branch)</placeName> in case of forfeitures,
which from what I understand are extremely probable as to some
few&#8212;far more than enough of Course to let me in&#8212; There is time
enough for that&#8212; Something certain may be effected by your
Consent When something more Certain is Known as to the <persName>persons</persName>
likely to fail,&#8212;</p>

<p>As to the Kind of Court, the people are wanting this <hi rend="italic">ambulatory</hi>
Kind of one&#8212;they are just seeking the means of their own Wicked
Discord&#8212;to have them just at hand for every day use&#8212; The 
Miserable <hi rend="italic">glory </hi>of having a suit in the <hi rend="italic">big Court</hi>, as it would seem to
hide many a <persName>scoundrels </persName>worthlessness,&#8212;how many would it entice<pb n="553"/>
to that Witching height of momentary greatness&#8212;the subject a
<hi rend="italic">shadow!</hi></p>

<p>I had an especial eye to that evil in refering to them in my
thoughts.   A big Court as it were on every <placeName>plantation</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The Theatre for display before the local <persName>Magistrate </persName>would be a
poor one and would I think tempt but a few comparatively to figure
upon it, to show their dexterity in litigation and reap a wonderful
Conspicuousness&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>P W Grayson</persName></p>
