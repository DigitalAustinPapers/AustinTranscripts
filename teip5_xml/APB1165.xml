<p><placeName>District of Victoria</placeName> <date when="1826-05-22">May 22d 1826</date></p>

<p><persName>Benjamin Fowler</persName> came to me and made the following statement;
That <persName>Isaac Hughs</persName> had been indebted to him three cow and calves
and thirty two dollars on an account; that this amount had been
due something like fifteen months and that the said <persName>Hughs</persName> had
offered him three cows and calves third rate cattle, in place of the
same number of first rate cows and calves which the note caled for,
and he the said <persName>Fowler</persName> further stated that he refused to receive them
unless the said <persName>Hughs</persName>&#8212;would pay him the difference between these
cattle and first rate cattle which the said<persName> Hughs</persName> refused to do, and
the&#8212;said <persName>Fowler</persName> further stated that he offered the said <persName>Hughs</persName> the
privilege of choseing&#8212;two men himself to say what diference there
was between these cattle and first rate cattle and abide by their
judgement which&#8212;proposition the said <persName>Hughs</persName> refused to comply
with. <persName>Fowler</persName> further says that the said <persName>Hughs</persName> told him that he was
about to leave the <placeName>country </placeName>and should not pay him unless he was
compeled to do so or words to that effect.</p>
<p>On the above statement of <persName>Fowler</persName>, I issued a forthwith summons
for <persName>Isaac Hughs</persName> which summons he refused to obey&#8212;I did not
conceive it a proper way of doing business to give judgement on a
forthwith unless the <persName>defendant </persName>was present. There was no 
judgment entered nor any attachment issued nor any thing of the kind</p>
<p>As to the cattle above mentioned which you order me to vallue
<persName>Mr. Hughs</persName> sold them to <persName>Mr. Bailey</persName> about the time the above 
transaction took place for thirteen dollars in trade I understood a head</p>
<p>As the cattle alluded to in <persName>Mr. Hughs</persName> petition were sold by him
I did not vallue them as you ordered me, as I supposed it was not
necessary</p>

<p>As to the judgement and attachment alluded to in <persName>Mr. Hughs</persName>'
petition I do assure you there is no such thing the business&#8212;ended
when the summons was returned without being obeyed<pb n="1348"/></p>

<p>I do certify this to be a true statement of proceedings had before
me in the above case</p>
