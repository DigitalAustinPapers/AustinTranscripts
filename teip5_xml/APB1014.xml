<p><persName>Col. Austin</persName>                                                         </p>

<p>Sir I recd- your communication to <persName>Wm Kincheloe</persName> to send you
the plat of the<placeName> Leagues on the Colorado</placeName> from <placeName><persName>Kuykendall</persName>'s League</placeName>
down. I have sent them over, and accompanying them you will find
the field notes of several Leagues in the <placeName>Bay Prairie</placeName> and one on the
<placeName>Bernard</placeName>. <persName>Mr Selkirk</persName> has run off the Leagues on the <placeName>West side of the
Colorado</placeName>, and from actual survey some of the lines differ 
considerable from the plat, and those numbers that differ you will find
either over or under the others and a bar across them thus,
in this way I have corrected all the lines, on the <placeName>west side of the river
</placeName>Those Leagues where <persName>Selkirk</persName> run on <placeName>both sides of the river</placeName> closed
very well, and very little alteration had to be made. Be careful and
reccollect that those numbers that have the bar accross them are the
right ones&#8212;We have run the Leagues as far down as <placeName><persName>Duke</persName>s place
</placeName>and have not yet touched the <placeName>Lake</placeName> that <persName>Williams</persName> lines on. I call it
a Lake because, since I left town I have been down to <persName>Williams</persName> and
find that the <placeName>south end of it is about two miles from <persName>Williams</persName></placeName>. We
go into the <placeName>woods </placeName>again tomorrow and shall succeed in finishing I
think by the middle of <date n="02-xx-1825">Feb</date>. if nothing uncommon takes place&#8212;</p>

<p>I understand that <persName>Mr Buckner</persName> has been to <placeName>Town</placeName> and made ap-
plication for the League taking in <placeName>the forks of Hunney  and Caney<pb n="1020"/>
creeks</placeName>, that is a choice that I made more than <date n="12-xx-1824">one month ago</date>, running 
it so as to take in the forks and the head of tide if it would do
both, I have not yet got any land on tide water and do not think that
<persName>Mr. Buckner</persName> has done quite right in taking that advantage of me,
however, I shall leave it to you to make it right.-</p>

<p>I have heard of <persName>Mr. Tong</persName> at <persName>Esqr Bells</persName> but have not yet seen him.</p>

<p>I have no more at present, but remain with due respect your friend
and humble</p>

<p><persName>Seth Ingram</persName></p>

<p>Col. <persName>S. F. Austin</persName>.</p>
