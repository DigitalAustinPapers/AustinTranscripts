<p><persName>Mr. J. F. Perry</persName></p>

<p>D Sir a <persName>gentleman </persName>had special charge as to the delivery of a
package brot <placeName>on board the Empress</placeName> finding I lived at this place
and the Schr would not wait he was compelled to leave them with
one of my <persName>workmen </persName>on the oposite side of the river. I 
immediately left for the <placeName>settlements </placeName>above and thus missed receiving the
package which contained the letter directed to you by<persName> Col A </persName>as I
infer from the hand writing&#8212;I have been exceedingly ill at <placeName><persName>Mr
Bell</persName>'s</placeName> for several days and was only able <date when="1834-07-26">yesterday morning</date> to be
moved after traveling all night by water arrived at <placeName>home </placeName>this
morning and hasten to forward the letter if it contains any knews
as to the <persName>Col </persName>do let us hear a brief sketch of it</p>

<p><persName>William Jack</persName> writes me from <placeName>San Felipe</placeName> that <persName>Genl Almonte </persName>is
in that place he finds him intelligent, pleasant, frank and candid
he assures him that if <persName>Col Austin</persName> is not already released that he
will unequivocaly be in a very short time says we are a badly
slandered people and were reported as being in a state of open
rebellion and that he was sent in order to ascertain and report
the facts and has and will take such measures as to set all on a fair
footing</p>

<p>I am truly yours much exhausted with fatigue and must lie
down   Only having just arrived at home</p>
