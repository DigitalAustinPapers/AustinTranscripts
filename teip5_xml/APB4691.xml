<p><date when="1834-10-29">October 29th 1834</date></p>

<p>You cannot realise the nature of my feelings on the favorable turn
matters are taking respecting yourself&#8212; This is <date when="1834-10-29">Wednesday</date>, On <date when="1834-10-26">Sunday</date>
morning I left your <persName>sister </persName>in quite good spirits her health tolerably good&#8212;
<persName>Mr. Perry</persName> and <persName>children </persName>well&#8212; <persName>Gregory </persName>enclosed yours of<date when="1834-10-25"> 25th</date> to me&#8212;
I was <placeName>at the mouth </placeName>and sent a <persName>runner </persName>with it to <persName>Mr. Perry</persName>. All the <persName>farmers
in the <placeName>low country</placeName></persName> with the trifling exception of very few who act for others,
joyously respond to your sentiments&#8212;"Mas vale tarde que nunca"
Lethargy has been completely shaken off by the mass of the <persName>Colonists</persName>, and you
cannot see or hear any thing, but wishes for your health and speedy return.
One proud and happy moment is in store for you, if no more, the hearty
welcome of <persName>thousands </persName>who are ready to hail your liberty from 
embarrassment, and your return among them. Our <persName>Chief of Department Henry Smith</persName>
came out on the <date when="1834-10-20">20th</date> in an official manifesto to the <persName>people advising <placeName>Texas</placeName>
</persName>to take care of herself etc&#8212; <persName>Chambers </persName>has stir'd them up at <placeName>Bejar</placeName>,and
they in their Weakness have made overtures to the <placeName>Colony </placeName>to join them,
and you must not blame your friends even th° they refuse benefits from
the hands of that man. he bolted and barred your prison doors, exulted in<pb n="15"/>
your sufferings, and has thereby put the seal to his political if not his moral
death in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; the knell has rung&#8212; he cannot now recall or retract&#8212;
The <persName>Central Committee</persName> met <date when="1834-10-28">yesterday</date>, appointed a Committee <persName>W. H. Jack</persName>,
<persName>Miller </persName>and <persName>Johnson</persName>, <persName>Jack </persName>is drawing up the manifest of their opinion, and
I assure you so far as he had gone with it <date when="1834-10-28">last evening</date> it is excellent, passing
excellent. <persName>Will Kill Smith</persName> and his <persName>friends</persName>, and check this present exertion
for a State, and <placeName>Bejar </placeName>will be told to wait, as <placeName>Texas </placeName>is advised by the 
<persName>Committee </persName>to have nothing to do with the State question. Determined as I am
never to meddle in politics, I thank God I am left the privilege of rejoicing
in your triumph, that is the triumph of your principles over those of base
and designing men. I am proud to see men who have once been opposed
to you Now the foremost to declare to the world the pleasure they have
in acknowledging themselves your friends and the supporters of your
advice and opinions&#8212;and the <persName>old 300</persName> almost to a man are warm in your
cause.</p>

<p>I am impressed with a belief that you are on your way <placeName>home</placeName>&#8212; I do not
extend&#8212; I hope you have drawn for the 1,000$ mentioned in mine to you
of <date when="1834-07-31">31 July</date>. I have just recd- yours of <date when="1834-09-07">7th September</date>- by the way of <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>,
yours of <date when="1834-08-25">25th Aug</date>- by mail to <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> has never got to hand. <persName>Austin
Bryan</persName> has just left me and I have sent your letter by him to <placeName>Town </placeName>to <persName>Capt
Martin </persName>and others who are there.&#8212; The <persName>authorities of the <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> may
attempt to lead the people into pronouncements etc. but they will not
stand it. <placeName>Texas </placeName>is safe. Remember me kindly to <persName>Grayson </persName>and <persName>Jack</persName>. Your
miniatures which were given to the <persName>Powell's</persName> have never been recd- 
Affectionately yours</p>

<p>I hope you recd mine of <date when="1834-09-15">15th Septr</date>- sent enclosed to <persName>Dr. Parrott</persName> with it
went your credentials of <persName>Deputado</persName>&#8212; <persName>McKinney </persName>is well and as always
your true friend&#8212; Our <placeName>firm </placeName>is <persName>McKinney and Williams</persName> We have a
<placeName>Warehouse </placeName><placeName>at the point opposite Velasco 60 feet square</placeName>.</p>
