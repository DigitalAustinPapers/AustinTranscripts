<p>Dear Sir: I recd yours on the subject of <persName>whitesides&#8212;children</persName>
feelings of Humanity was the only thing which Induced me first to become their <persName>Guardian </persName>and those feeling still Exist but why should I
Involve myself in a life time difficulty for those whom from acquaintance nor no other causes have any claims on me as for the
<persName>children </persName>I pitty them their <persName>uncle</persName> is not nor never will be capable of
dooing anything for them. But this is not my business he is their
<persName>Relation </persName>and I am not. therefore I am willing that you should ap<pb n="1246"/>point him   I will give him the <persName>children</persName> when ever he calls for them
My obligation as <persName>Guardian </persName>I shall Expect Returned to me etc&#8212;</p>

<p>We burried our little <persName>daughter</persName> <date when="1826-01-06">yesterday </date>she died suddenly I move to <placeName>Bravo</placeName> next week you Inclosed an order from <persName>Joshua
Parker</persName> to a <persName>Mr. Bell</persName>, for 2 Horses in one of your letters without
saying any thing about It. I know nothing about it. what is the
meaning of it or what doo you want done with the order</p>

<p>You say that the <persName>Goverment </persName>is displeased that you did not go
to war with the <persName>Wacos</persName> and <persName>Coumanches</persName> I am sorry to hear this but
sir we have better be driven out of the <placeName>country</placeName> by the <persName>Goverment</persName>
than by the <persName>Indians</persName> there is no one in the <placeName>country</placeName> that is more
disposed to defend the <placeName>country</placeName> than I am But as we are at peace
with those <persName>Indians</persName> we must remain so and even put up with some
abuse from them until we are able to fight them If we get into
difficulty with those <persName>Indians</persName> the <persName>Goverment </persName>is not able to assist us
and we are unable off ourselves to contend with them and my
oppinion is that the only policy for us is to let those <persName>Indians</persName> alone
say nothing to them and If the <persName>Goverment </persName>will force us into a war
with them we must make the best of It. I am allways Ready to act
my part,    in peace or war</p>

<p><persName>Jno P. Coles  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Benjamin Edwards</persName> was very angry a few days previous to his
leaving here with you and I am convinced he was Rong and I
believe I satisfied him that he was Rong for the want of paper I
do not Relate the particulars but we will speak of It when I see you</p>
