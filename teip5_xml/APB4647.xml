<p><placeName>Mexico Exinquisition </placeName><date when="1834-06-03">June 3. 1834</date></p>
<p><persName>S. M. Williams</persName></p>

<p>On the <date n="05-031-1834">31st </date>I drew on the <persName>house of Beers St. John &amp; Co</persName>. for seven
hundred forty seven dollars 51/100</p>

<p>I have received three letters from you <date when="1834-03-13">13 March</date> <date when="1834-04-13">13</date> and <date when="1834-04-15">15 April</date>&#8212;
also information that I could draw on the above house, from <persName>Don
E. M. [Ramon Musquiz]</persName> through his <persName>brother-in-law</persName>&#8212;all that
<persName>family </persName>have been firm and true <persName>friends </persName>to me in all my troubles
and I hope my friends will never forget them</p>

<p>I have heard of the laws passed by the <placeName>state </placeName>in favor of <placeName>Texas </placeName>I
have not seen them except the land law which I approve of very
much and of all the others so far as I have heard of them</p>

<p>I think it is the duty of the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> to return thanks in
a public manner to the <persName>state Govt</persName>, through the <persName>Ayuntamientos </persName>and
<persName>chief of departments</persName> for these laws and also to make a most solemn
and positive declaration of their firm adhesion, union and 
attachment to the <placeName>state of Coahuila and Texas</placeName> and to the <placeName>Mexican 
confederation</placeName>. This declaration or document ought to be drawn up in
an able manner, concise, but clear and full and it ought to be 
published in the <placeName>U. S</placeName>. in order to correct public opinion there as to
the intentions and objects of the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>The position taken by them last year was <hi rend="italic">" that the evils which
threatened that <placeName>country </placeName>with anarchy and ruin must be remedied by
the <persName>Govt</persName>, or the <persName>people </persName>would remedy them of themselves and
ought to do so, as in the last resort they wiould have the right to do
so on the principle of self preservation"</hi></p>

<p>I sustained this position firmly as the <persName>agent of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> before the
<persName>ministers </persName>and the <persName>vice president</persName> and my letter of <date when="1833-10-02">2 October</date> [was
based] upon it, and upon the public good and general interest of the<pb n="1061"/>
<placeName>republic </placeName>and of <placeName>Coahuila and Texas</placeName> by recommending that the 
constituted <persName>municipal authorities </persName>should take up the subject and thus
prevent popular commotions.</p>

<p>A frank and plain statement of these facts and of the true situation
of <placeName>Texas </placeName>and the state of public opinion etc all embodied in the
document of public thanks to the <persName>Govt</persName>, above mentioned, would place
the whole matter in its true light before the world, and contradict all
the calumnies and false reports, that the <hi rend="italic">intentions </hi>and <hi rend="italic">objects </hi>of
those people, and also my objects, were a total separation from
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;such reports are all false. It is also reported here that those
<persName>people </persName>have abandoned me and wish me shot or imprisoned for life,
and the <persName>enemies of North Americans</persName> and of <placeName>Texas </placeName>are making use
of this calumny both against me and against the <persName>people of Texas</persName>,
for our <persName>enemies </persName>wish to make out that those people are ungrateful
and bad, and they say that if they abandon me they would also
abandon the <persName>Govt</persName>. etc. etc.&#8212;all calumnies and false.</p>

<p>I particularly requested those <persName>people </persName>not to be excited on account
of my arrest, and strongly urged and begged that they would remain
quiet and faithful to the <placeName>state of Coahuila and Texas</placeName>, as I had no
doubt the state government would remedy the evils complained of&#8212;
I thank the <persName>people </persName>for having complyed with my request. The result
has shown that I was right. The evils have all been remedied in a
<hi rend="italic">legal </hi>manner, excitement and commotions kept down in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, The
<persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> and the <placeName>whole state</placeName> and <placeName>nation </placeName>have been served
<hi rend="italic">effectually </hi>and all motives for discontent in future are forever 
removed. My mission to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">the position taken by my 
<persName>constituents </persName>and firmly sustained by me</hi> here, and my imprisonment and
sufferings and the <hi rend="italic">noise </hi>and <hi rend="italic">alarm </hi>occasioned by all these things&#8212;
have materially contributed to bring about this happy result&#8212;and
I therefore do not regret what I have suffered and the money I have
spent. On my part I risked all for those <persName>people </persName>and to sustain the
position taken by them&#8212;I now expect that <hi rend="italic">they </hi>on their part will do
justice to the <persName>Govt </persName>who has remedied all their evils, to me their
<persName>agent</persName>&#8212;and to themselves as high minded and honorable <persName>men </persName>and as
true and faithful <persName>Mexican citizens</persName>.</p>

<p>All this they can do by a public and official document of the 
character before mentioned combining a statement of facts as to 
themselves, and as to me their <persName>agent</persName>; thanks to the <persName>Govt </persName>for what has
been done; and a clear declaration of union and fidelity to the <placeName>state</placeName>
and to the <placeName>Mexican confederation.</placeName></p>

<p>This will place the matter before the world in its true light, and
do justice to all parties and silence calumny for ever&#8212;it will also
keep ambitious or restless spirits quiet.<pb n="1062"/></p>

<p><persName>D. G. Burnet</persName> would be a good hand to draft such a document
aided by <persName>Capt Martin</persName>, <persName>Miller</persName>, <persName>Jack</persName>, <persName>Chambers</persName>, <persName>Jones</persName>, <persName>Adams</persName>,
<persName>Johnson</persName>, <persName>Lesassier </persName>etc&#8212;</p>

<p>My <persName>enemies </persName>in the <placeName>low country </placeName>that you speak of will do me 
justice&#8212;no one can be so base as to calumniate the man who has served
them faithfully and is suffering for their benefit&#8212;personal feelings
are momentary in their influence but <hi rend="italic">justice </hi>will finally prevail over
them.   I wrote <date when="1834-06-02">yesterday </date>to <persName>Oliver Jones.</persName></p>

<p>Remember me to <persName>Ramon Musquiz</persName> particularly&#8212;I shall feel 
grateful to him and <persName>D. Vr B° [Victor Blanco]</persName> as long as I live and hope
my <persName>friends </persName>will&#8212;also remember [me] to everybody&#8212;let the present
happy situation of that <placeName>country </placeName>forever bury all personal feelings.
<hi rend="italic">I bury them forever</hi>&#8212;and let us all devote ourselves to cultivate the
soil, make good crops, and be good neighbors and good citizens&#8212; so
soon as I can close my affairs so as to get on to a <placeName>farm </placeName>I will do so,
and it will be a difficult matter to drag me away from it&#8212;unless
it be to go to a <placeName>ball </placeName>or a <placeName>social meeting</placeName> of friends. I am done with
public matters, that is when I get free from them I mean to keep
so&#8212;-and I mean to get free as soon as I can&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>You can show this letter to whom you think proper I send it
via <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> I am in good health I was <hi rend="italic">incomunicado 
rigororisimo</hi> from the <date when="1834-02-13">13 Feby</date> to <date when="1834-05-09">9 May</date>&#8212;no books or writing materials
and very little light&#8212;dreary enough, but the idea that <placeName>Texas </placeName>would
be benefited and that I had done my duty kept up my spirits and I
bore all patiently. I hope that <persName>Almonte </persName>who was sent to <placeName>Texas </placeName>by
<persName>Govt</persName>, has been well received and kindly treated, no friend of mine
or of <placeName>Texas </placeName>would think of treating him or any other <persName>commissioner
of the Govt</persName>, in any other manner than with attention and politeness.
The <persName>enemies of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, or my <persName>enemies </persName>might wish to take a different
course in order to make confusion and difficulty.</p>

<p><persName>S.F.A</persName>.</p>

<p>I sent a power of attorney to my <persName>brother-in-law</persName> to sell property
and I now send a duplicate.   I wrote him by way of <placeName>Orleans </placeName><date when="1834-05-10">10 May</date>.</p>
