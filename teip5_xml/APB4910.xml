<p><placeName>Committee room of the <persName>Committee
of safety of the jurisdiction of Austin</persName></placeName></p>
<p><persName>San Felipe de Austin</persName> <date when="1835-10-04">Oct. 4, 1835</date></p>
<p>War is declared against military despotism&#8212; Public opinion has 
proclaimed it with one united voice&#8212; The campaign has opened. The 
<persName>military at <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> have advanced upon <placeName>Gonzales</placeName>. <persName>General Cos</persName> has arrived and
threatens to overrun the <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>But one spirit, one common purpose, animates <persName>every one in this 
department</persName>, which is to take <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and drive all the <persName>military </persName>out of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, 
before the campaign closes.</p>

<p>There are about <persName>three hundred volunteers at <placeName>Gonzales</placeName></persName> at this time, and
will be upwards of five hundred in a few days.</p>

<p>It is confidently believed <placeName>in this quarter</placeName> that the <persName>people of the 
<placeName>department of Nacogdoches</placeName></persName> will turn out and join the <persName><hi rend="italic">army of the people</hi></persName> now in
the <placeName>field </placeName>and facing the <persName>enemy</persName>.</p>

<p>Arms and ammunition are needed; we have more <persName>men </persName>than guns. Could
not some muskets be procured from the<placeName> other side of the Sabine</placeName>? This
<persName>committee </persName>will contribute, and is responsible that the <persName>people </persName>here will do
the same, to pay a full proportion of the expense. This is all important&#8212;<pb n="158"/>
a few wagon loads of muskets and fixed ammunition would be of the 
utmost service at this time. Could not <persName>volunteers </persName>also be had from the
<placeName>United States</placeName>? Our cause is one that merits the moral and physical aid of
a <persName>free and magnanimous people</persName>, and those who now step forward, may
confidently expect that <placeName>Texas </placeName>will reward their services.</p>

<p>That distinguishd and virtuous patriot <persName>Don Lorenzo de Zavala</persName> formerly
<persName>governor of the State of Mexico</persName>, and <persName>late minister to France</persName> has just 
arrived from his <placeName>residence on San Jacinto</placeName>, and is now here at the <placeName>residence of
the chairman of the committee</placeName>. He is a citizens of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and enters fully
and warmly in the cause of the <persName>people</persName>, approves very much of the position
they have taken against military despotism, and of the <placeName>circular </placeName>of this
<persName>committee </persName>of the <date when="1835-09-19">19th ult</date>.</p>

<p>This <persName>committee </persName>relys on you to forward copies of this communication
to <placeName>San Augustin</placeName> and the other <persName>committees in<placeName> that quarter</placeName></persName>, and also to send
the inclosed papers to <persName>some parties in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName></persName> (<placeName>circulars </placeName>of this 
<persName>committee </persName>of the <date when="1835-09-19">19th ult</date>. and <date when="1835-10-03">3 October</date> and public proceedings of other 
<persName>committees</persName>), for publication, in order that the <persName>public </persName>may be generally 
informed of the present state of affairs in <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>An <persName>express </persName>has been sent to <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> and <placeName>Trinity</placeName>, it would however
be important for that <persName>committee </persName>to communicate with the <persName>people of <placeName>Trinity</placeName>
and <placeName>Bevils Settlement</placeName></persName>, as it inspires confidence to know that the <placeName>whole
country</placeName> is acting in union and with one and the same spirit and one 
purpose&#8212; This, as I before observed, is to take <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and drive the <persName>military</persName>
out of <placeName>Texas </placeName>before the campaign closes.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin Chairman of Com.</persName></p>

<p>To the <persName>Committee of Safety of <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>and <placeName>San Augustin</placeName></persName></p>
