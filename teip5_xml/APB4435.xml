<p>Statement presented to ------ Martin, relative to the settlement of the business between
<persName>S. F. Austin</persName> and the <persName>late J. H. Hawkins</persName></p>

<p>In <date n="11-xx-1821">Novr. 1821</date> a contract was made between <persName>S. F. Austin</persName> and <persName>J. H.
Hawkins</persName>, relative to settling the <placeName>colony </placeName>originally contracted to be
settled by <persName>Moses Austin</persName>, the <persName>father of the said Stephen F. Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>A <persName>partnership </persName>was also formed between the said <persName>S. F. Austin</persName> and
the said <persName>Hawkins</persName> for certain purposes: this <persName>partnership </persName>expired by
the death of <persName>Hawkins </persName>in <date n="xx-xx-1823">1823</date>.</p>

<p>At the time of forming that contract, it was supposed that 
something could be realized out of the <persName>settlers</persName>; and an arrangement was
made for them to pay 12 1/2 cents pr acre for the <placeName>land </placeName>they received,
<persName>Austin </persName>to be at all the expense. This arrangement was totally 
destroyed by the interference of the <persName>Govr. of <placeName>Texas </placeName>in <date n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date></persName>. A large
sum was lost by <persName>Austin </persName>for surveys which were made up to that time,
and meanderings of the <placeName>river</placeName>.</p>

<p>In <date n="05-xx-1824">May 1824</date> the <persName>Govr. of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> interfered with the said first 
arrangement, and established a fee-bill. None of these fees belonged
to <persName>Austin</persName>; and he had no right to use any of them. One hundred
and twenty seven dollars, 50 cents, were allowed to the <persName>Commissioner</persName>,
including his milage <placeName>from Bexar to the colony</placeName>; 30 dollars to the
<persName>Govt</persName>.; and 8 dollars for the Title. The <persName>Commissioner </persName>relinquished
to <persName>Austin </persName>the third of his fees.</p>

<p><persName>Austin </persName>was appointed by the <persName>Govt</persName>, to administer the local 
government of the <placeName>colony </placeName>in all its branches, civil, judicial, and military,
without any salary. He also had to attend in person to all the 
land business.    Besides this he kept an open <placeName>house </placeName>and was compelled to<pb n="860"/>
do so: his <placeName>house </placeName>was always full, for the first six years, as is well
known to those who were here then. It is also well known, that he
had constant visits from the <persName>Tankaway</persName>, <persName>Lipan</persName>, <persName>Beedi</persName>, and other
<persName>Indians</persName>; and the situation of things required him to make them large
presents.</p>

<p>These expenses were not all: he paid for expresses, furnished 
provisions, and amunition, and many other things for campaigns against
the <persName>Indians</persName>. He was compelled to keep an <placeName>office</placeName>, and a <persName>Secretary</persName>,
and <persName>Clerks</persName>, acquainted with the Spanish and English languages&#8212;It
will be remembered that, at that time, every thing was dear&#8212;Cows
at from $20 to $30 each; pork from $9 to $10; beeves from $25 to $80
a head; corn from one to two dollars the bushel; etc. The expenses
of his <placeName>household </placeName>were not less than $2000 a year: his <placeName>office </placeName>including
the <persName>Secretary</persName>'s salary, stationery, etc $1500. a year: presents to
<persName>Indians </persName>$500 a year. To all this is to be added a variety of other
expenses, such as <persName>expresses</persName>, <persName>guards</persName>, and supplies for <persName>Indian </persName>
expeditions. Also he had a heavy surveying debt to pay, as above stated.
Besides these expenses, there are many others which can not be
mentioned.</p>

<p>A large amount of the fees never has been collected, and never will
be. Also a considerable amount was lost that was received in herdes,
which died or were stolen by the <persName>Indians</persName>. Twelve head were stolen
at one time, ten of them mules, at <placeName><persName>Buckner</persName>'s old place on the Colorado.</placeName></p>

<p>But even supposing that the fees had all been collected and in
money: the whole amount of the <persName>Commissioner</persName>'s fees on<persName> 300 families</persName>
at $127.50, is $38,250&#8212;of this one third was relinquished by the
<persName>Commr </persName>to <persName>Austin</persName>, which is $12,750 which would not have half paid
the expenses of the <persName>local govt</persName>, and other expenses of the <placeName>colony </placeName><date n="1823-1828">from
1823 up to 1828</date>, the time when the <persName>Ayuntamto </persName>was established; to say
nothing of a compensation for<persName> Austin</persName>'s services, and a deduction of
more than one half for property payments at an excessive value.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that <persName>Austin </persName>received no salary from the
<persName>Govt</persName>., nor any allowance whatever for the local government of the
<placeName>colony</placeName>, that all the labor, expense, danger, and responsability rested
on him alone:&#8212;all the vexations, labyrinths of the <placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212;matters
with the <persName>government</persName>, and with the <persName>settlers</persName>, who were several times
in a state of rebellion against him, and always complaining and
abusing him, because they had anything to pay: he had to bear all
this patiently, as the salvation of the <placeName>colony </placeName>required it. The facts
as to advances made by <persName>Hawkins </persName>are as follows:</p>

<p>The Schooner Lively, a small vessel of about 30 Tons, was 
purchased for $600 in <date n="12-xx-1821">Novr. 1821</date>: of this sum <persName>Austin </persName>furnished $400,
which he borrowed from <persName>Lovelace </persName>and now owes, with the interest&#8212;
The Lively brought out 17 or 18 <persName>men</persName>, <persName>emigrants</persName>, and provisions<pb n="861"/>
and tools. I do not know the whole amount of her outfit; but it
is very evident that it could not have been much. The Lively landed
the <persName>emigrants </persName><placeName>at the mouth of the Brazos</placeName>, and was lost on 
<placeName>Galveston Island</placeName>. <persName>William Little</persName> had the charge of the <persName>men </persName>who came
in the Lively: I never saw any of them until after my return from
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>in <date n="xx-xx-1823">1823</date>, owing to their having landed in the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>instead
of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, to the mouth of which latter river I went to look
for them, agreeably to appointment in <date n="12-xx-1821">Decr, </date><date n="01-xx-1821">and Jany. of 1821 and
1822</date>; and not finding them I proceeded to <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and thence to
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>. The <persName>men </persName>who came in the Lively became discouraged, and
all returned to the<placeName> U. S.</placeName> except two or three.</p>

<p>For a part of the expences to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, I drew on <persName>Hawkins</persName>; for
I had between 300 and 400 dollars of my own money which I brought
with me from<placeName> New Orleans</placeName> in doubloons. I lost my memorandum
and account book at <placeName>Monterey</placeName>, on my return from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and
cannot state what was the amount of my drafts on <persName>Hawkins</persName>; but
they were not for a large sum:&#8212;I lived very economically, and
even endured privations to save expense. I raised $100 in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
by the sale of my watch.</p>

<p>When I started for <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, I sent into <persName>Hawkins </persName>my <persName>negro man
Richmond</persName>, a stout healthy <persName>negro</persName>, about 28 years of age: he was
worth $800.</p>

<p>On a fair statement of this whole matter, what benefits or aid,
have I derived, in the settlement of this <placeName>colony</placeName>, from <persName>Hawkins</persName>?</p>

<p>He aided in fitting out the Lively: he furnished the amount of my
drafts for the expenses to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>: he could not have been of much
aid in sending out <persName>emigrants</persName>, for he died before there was much
emigration. The money which he spent for the goods that 
<persName>Littlebury Hawkins</persName> brought out, and a vast sum in the <persName>negro </persName>speculation
of which <persName>John Botts</persName> had the management, had nothing to do with
the <placeName>colony</placeName>; and I was in no manner concerned in those speculations,
nor ever had any control over them. Both these <persName>persons </persName>arrived
after I departed for <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and left before I returned.&#8212;Neither
am I accountable for an enormous interest account which, I am told,
<persName>Hawkins </persName>paid in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, to raise money for the expeditions
of <persName>Littlebury Hawkins</persName>, and <persName>John Botts</persName>.</p>

<p>In the contract with <persName>Hawkins </persName>I acknowledge to have received
four thousand dollars, but the truth is I had not then received
that amount, and never have received it up to this time. For, as
I before observed, all that ever was spent for the benefit of the
<placeName>Colony</placeName>, that I have any knowledge of, was the outfit of the Lively,
and the amount of my drafts for the <placeName>Mexico </placeName>trip: and out of that
the $400 dollars I borrowed from <persName>Lovelace</persName>, and over $300 which<pb n="862"/>
I had of my own money, and the value of my <persName>negro Richmond</persName>, and
$100 for my watch, making about $1600 ought to be deducted.</p>

<p>As I before observed, none of the fees that were collected in the
<placeName>first colony</placeName>, belonged to me of right; a part of them were given
to me; but necessity compelled me to use much more of them than
the portion thus relinquished:&#8212;and I thus may yet become 
entangled in an endless and ruinous labyrinth. Up to this time
<persName>Hawkins </persName>is entirely clear of all responsibility as to those fees thus
used by me. I have always been very cautious not to implicate
any part of his landed interest in any way. I have been a true
and<persName> paternal guardian</persName> of the interests of his <persName>heirs in this <placeName>country</placeName></persName>,
and I have kept his part of the <placeName>land </placeName>entirely clear. I have not
even sold any more of it, than was absolutely necessary to give
value to the balance, and to comply with the law by having the
land settled; and this has subjected me to the abuse and slander
of <persName>persons </persName>who wished to get places near <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, and who have
spared no pains to try and prejudice public opinion against me.
I have, in fact, from the beginning of the <placeName>Colony </placeName>struggled alone
in this <placeName>wilderness</placeName>, undergoing all sorts of privations, and my life
often embittered by the unjust clamors, slanders, and abuse which
I have been compelled by circumstances to bear. No pecuniary
remuneration could, or ever can, recompense me for the last ten
years.</p>

<p>If the fees, received from the <persName>Settlers in the <placeName>first Colony</placeName></persName>, as
above stated, are now to be considered as <persName>partnership </persName>property,
<persName>Hawkins </persName>must also become liable for all the responsibilities which
I am, or may ever be, liable to for having used more of those
fees than I had a right to. Also a fair statement must be made
of all the expenses of the local govt, of the <placeName>colony</placeName>, of the losses
by bad debts, robbery of <persName>Indians</persName>, <placeName>office </placeName>expenses, losses by 
surveying, and a yearly compensation to <persName>Austin </persName>for his services. The
gross amount of all this must be made up: then the amount of the
fees which <persName>Austin </persName>was entitled to receive by the relinquishment
of the <persName>Commissioner</persName>, must be made out, and deducted from the
gross amount of the expenses. It will then be found that a large
balance of many thousands will be due to pay those expenses, and
the balance will bo a charge against the <placeName>partnership land</placeName>, and
would consume a large part of it.</p>

<p>But this is not all. <persName>Hawkins </persName>would also have to be liable, in
union with <persName>Austin</persName>, for all the responsabilities that may arise, owing
to <persName>Austin</persName>'s having used more of the fees than the amount relinquished
to him by the <persName>Commissioner</persName>. In short, it would place <persName>Hawkins'
estate</persName> in the situation in which I am now placed; that is liable to
be harrassed as long as I live, and involved in an endless labyrinth
of difficulties; and besides all this, there are matters connected with<pb n="863"/>
this business which are in the highest degree confidential and cannot
be explained without a breach of faith.</p>

<p>I have probably done nearly as much to benefit <persName>individuals </persName>as
ever was done by any one man in <placeName>America </placeName>who acted in the humble
sphere of an unpatronised, unprotected, and private <persName>person</persName>. I have
been instrumental in laying a <placeName>broad foundation for the fortunes of
many thousands</placeName>. The enterprise has succeeded, and begins to 
attract notice; but no one knows, or seems to care, or to ask, how, or
by what means, or through whose instrumentality it has been brought
about. The only idea most <persName>persons </persName>seem to connect with the matter
is, that of a mammoth speculation; and they say that <persName>Austin</persName>, in
doing so much for so many, must have done a great deal for 
himself. Thus the most erroneous impressions, and the most unjust
rumors, are set afloat. Ingratitude, jealousy, and suspicions are
always active and vociferous.</p>

<p>What benefit has <persName>Austin </persName>received from the fees of the <placeName>first colony</placeName> ?
There are <placeName>six leagues and a half, and two labors, of land </placeName>which were
acquired by <persName>purchases </persName>from the <persName>settlers </persName>out of these fees, and deeded
to my<persName> brother J. E. B. Austin</persName> because there was no <persName>judicial officer</persName>
in the <placeName>colony </placeName>but me, before whom the deed could be acknowledged.
The titles for a part of this are doubtful. I have also used a part
of those fees to pay some of my old debts, but I have also used a
large amount of the proceeds of my last contracts that <persName>Hawkins </persName>had
nothing to do with, to satisfy the debts that were properly 
changeable to the <placeName>first colony</placeName>: and consequently if the fees of the <placeName>first
colony</placeName> are to go with the <persName>partnership </persName>accounts, all I have paid out
of my last contracts on account of the <placeName>first colony</placeName>, must be charged
to that <placeName>colony</placeName>.</p>

<p>What benefit will <persName>Hawkins' estate</persName> receive for the advances he
made in fitting out the Lively, and in paying my drafts for the
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>trip, which was all he did advance that was of use to the
enterprise ? The <persName>estate </persName>gets the <placeName>half of 22 1/2 leagues of land</placeName>. I get
the other half, and I have done all the labor. In fact I have done
every thing alone and without receiving aid from the personal 
services, or the capital, of <persName>Hawkins </persName>to the extent that was originally
contemplated.</p>

<p>To recapitulate.</p>

<p>The first arrangement with the <persName>settlers</persName>, as to fees, was distroyed
by the interference of the <persName>Govt of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</persName> A new arrangement was
made by the Govt as to the fees, which allowed Austin to receive
none of them. The <persName>Commissioner </persName>relinquished a part of them to
<persName>Austin</persName>. The part thus relinquished has been used by <persName>Austin </persName>for
the joint benefit of the <persName>partnership</persName>; for by that means he has main-<pb n="864"/>
tained the <placeName>colony </placeName>without creating any charge against the 
<placeName>partnership lands </placeName>which are now clear.</p>

<p><persName>Austin </persName>has used more of those fees than were so relinquished;
and by so doing he is liable to be harrassed; and if <persName>Hawkins </persName>claims
a part of those fees, he will have to bear his share of that liability:
as also to bear an equal share of all the expenses of the <placeName>colony</placeName>, and
to pay <persName>Austin </persName>for his services. This can not be done without taking
<placeName>a part of the premium land</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Austin </persName>never did receive $4000 for the use of the <placeName>colony </placeName>from
<persName>Hawkins</persName>; and he did furnish about $1600 which, on a rigid 
settlement, <persName>Hawkins </persName>would be accountable for. <persName>Austin </persName>is not liable for
the money spent in the expeditions of <persName>Littleberry Hawkins</persName> and <persName>John
Botts</persName>; nor for the interest paid by <persName>Hawkins</persName>.</p>

<p>It would be the work of many years, and of endless expense, to
bring this matter to a judicial or litigated settlement; and I am
confident that such a settlement, in any court of justice, would in
volve <placeName>more than one half the premium land </placeName>to square the accounts
of the <placeName>colony </placeName>if they were justly, stated; besides the delay and
expense.</p>

<p>I therefore think that in offering to divide the <placeName>premium land,
twenty two leagues and a half, and three labors</placeName>, deducting the
expenses of surveying it, I offer at least one half more than could
be recovered in any <placeName>court of justice.</placeName> The original expenses of 
surveying the premium land are a just charge against it: they were
paid by me in <date n="xx-xx-1824">1824 </date>and <date n="xx-xx-1825">1825</date>. More than this I am unwilling to do;
and in doing this I consider that I am relinquishing a part of what
justly belongs to me; for if a fair allowance were made to me, I
should be entitled to a considerable portion of <persName>Hawkins</persName>' part of the
<placeName>premium land</placeName>. The truth is, that I could have done all that I have
done, had I never known <persName>Hawkins</persName>, nor received one cent, nor aid,
from any <placeName>quarter </placeName>beyond my own resources.</p>

<p>Difficulties present themselves as to the manner of making this
settlement. Ever since <date n="xx-xx-1824">early in 1824</date> I have repeatedly requested,
and urged often and often, that an <persName>Agent </persName>might be sent out to settle
this business. The delay has not been of my causing, or of my 
seeking. Now after so long a period <persName>Mr. Martin</persName> is sent with very 
imperfect powers. <persName>George </persName>is not represented at all. The original 
contract between me and <persName>Hawkins </persName>is not produced: I never had a copy
of it:&#8212;there was but one made out and that <persName>J. H. Hawkins</persName> retained.
<persName>Edmund Hawkins</persName>, who is here present, is not competent to settle
his own share of the business, for by the laws of this <placeName>country </placeName>he is
a <persName>minor </persName>until he is twenty five years of age, and is therefore 
incompetent to bind himself, or any one else. He can not legally hold the
<placeName>land </placeName>after it is divided: he will have to appoint a <persName>guardian </persName>in the<pb n="865"/>
manner prescribed by law, and this <persName>guardian </persName>will have to attend
to this part of the business.</p>

<p>I wish to make a final settlement of this matter, and will do every
thing to effect that object which will be legal and finally binding
on all <persName>parties</persName>.</p>

<p>I make this statement to correct the erroneous impressions which
the <persName>parties </persName>interested in this Business appear to have received from
common rumor; and to show that, on my part, every thing has been
done which circumstances would admit to protect the interests of
<persName>Hawkins' estate</persName>. Also it ought to be remembered that I requested
a settlement of this business since soon after <persName>Hawkins</persName>' death, and
that I could long since have brought it to a settlement by a judicial
process. The delay has been very injurious and very harrassing to
me, but it has been beneficial to the <persName>estate</persName>.</p>

<p>There is another erroneous idea relative to the business of 
colonization in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Many believe that actual <placeName>grants </placeName>are made by the
<persName>Govt</persName>, of <placeName>large tracts of land, or sections of country</placeName>, to individuals
who are denominated in the Law <persName>Empresarios</persName>; and that these 
<persName>individuals </persName>can sell this land. This is all a mistake. It is also wrong
to call them <placeName>grants</placeName>: they are nothing more than Trusts by which the
<persName>contractor </persName>or " <persName>empresario </persName>", is constituted the <persName>agent of the Govt</persName>, to
settle a certain number of <persName>families </persName>of a particular description, in
certain designated limits, within a limited time. If he comply with
