<p><placeName>Camp before Bexar</placeName> [December 6, 1835]</p>

<p>To the <persName>President of the Provisional Governt</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><date when="1835-12-05">Yesterday Morning</date> at day light or rather some twenty minutes before
<persName>Colo Milam</persName> with a party of about <persName>300 volunteers</persName> made an assault upon the
Town of <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, his <persName>party </persName>he divided into <persName>two divisions</persName>, which on entering
into the <placeName>Town </placeName>took possession of two <placeName>houses </placeName>near each Other, <placeName>near the
plasa</placeName>, where they have been ever since, Battling with the <persName>enemy</persName>, they have
so far had a fierce contest the <persName>enemy </persName>offering a strong and obstinate 
resistance it is difficult to determine what injuries has been done him, many
<persName>killed </persName>Certainly, but how many cannot be told, on our side ten or twelve
<persName>wounded </persName>two killed, the <placeName>houses </placeName>occupied by us commands some of the
Cannon in the place, or have silenced them intirely, as it is reported to us,
<hi rend="italic">the Issue is doubtful of course</hi>&#8212;<persName>Ugartchear </persName>is on the way with considerable
<persName>reinforcements</persName>, how near exactly, has not yet been ascertained, but 
certainly he is not more than fifty or sixty Miles off, this <persName>express </persName>has been 
dispatched for an immediate supply of ammunition, as much powder and lead,
as can possibly be sent, instantly, of the first mentioned article there is
none beyond the Cannon Catridges, already made up, I hope that good
Mules, or horses, will be provided to send on these articles, with the 
greatest possible speed, traveling night and day, for there is not a moment to be
lost, <persName>reinforcements </persName>of men also are perhaps indispencible to our 
salvation, I hope every exertion will be made to force them out to our relief
immedeately</p>
