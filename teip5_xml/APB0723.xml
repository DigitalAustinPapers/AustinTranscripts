<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1824-04-20">April 20, 1824.</date>
I received only <date when="1824-04-19">yesterday </date>your communication of the <date when="1824-03-18">18th of
March last</date>, in which amongst other things, you instruct me to send
a certified power of the people of this <placeName>Colony</placeName>, appointing an elector
to proceed to the electoral meeting for electing a <persName>Representative in
the Legislature of the State</persName>, I lost no time in sending expresses in
every direction to obtain the votes of the <persName>Colonists</persName>, and I am 
authorized by over one half of them to say to you that they have elected<pb n="769"/>
the <persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName>, our Representative in the Most Excellent
Deputation, to be our <persName>elector </persName>for the above mentioned object. As
soon as I receive the votes of the others, I shall forward them to
the <persName>Government</persName>, for due authenticity. In the meanwhile, and at
the request of those who have already voted, I send to you the 
inclosed power certified by the <persName>Alcalde of this District of San Felipe</persName>,
that of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, and myself, for the truthfulness of which we
are personally responsible. We can also assure you that the <persName>Baron
de Bastrop</persName> will be unanimously elected by the <persName>people of this
<placeName>Colony</placeName></persName>. Time has not allowed me to do anything else because, is
I have already said, your communication was received <date when="1824-04-19">yesterday</date>
only; and I have thought advisable to avail myself of an occasion
offering to day for <placeName>La Bahia</placeName>, to report the subject to you, I have
received the Constitutive Act and the Law creating the Legislature
of this State; in Compliance with your order, I have appointed the
<date when="1824-05-01">1st of May next</date> for proclaiming and swearing to said Constitutive
Act with all the solemnity and enthusiasm required by that 
important, and glorious subject, of which I shall give you a 
circumstantial account by next occasion. There has been nothing new in
the <placeName>Colony</placeName>, since the encounter of a party of <persName>Karankauases </persName>some
time since, by some <persName>inhabitants of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName>, which incident I
have reported to the <persName>Military Commander</persName>. It has not been possible
as yet to sell the corn contributed by these people for the 
<persName>Representative in Congress</persName></p>

<p><persName>Estevan F Austin
Political Chief of the
<placeName>Colony on the Colorado and Brazos</placeName></persName></p>

<p>I pray you to excuse my erasures and bad Spanish; but the 
person who will take this letter is about to leave, and will not wait until
I can have a clean copy made</p>

<p><persName>E F Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>José Antonio Saucedo,
Political Chief of the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName></persName>.</p>
