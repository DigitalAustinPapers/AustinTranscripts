<p>[About May 1, 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir:&#8212;After a long and tedious journey, I am at length at
the <placeName>fountain head of the <hi rend="italic">new born nation</hi></placeName>. All I will say at 
present, (in regard to the country over which I have passed, since I left
<placeName>Texas</placeName>,) is, that no one after reading <persName>Humboldt </persName>and other <persName>writers</persName>,
can pass through this country without being sorely disappointed at<pb n="505"/>
every step. The <placeName>nation</placeName>, however, possesses great resources, and its
vast and successful effort for independence combined with the 
general harmony which at this time prevails, furnish, I think, sure
pledges of future greatness and prosperity.</p>

<p>In regard to my <placeName>grant </placeName>and <placeName>settlement</placeName>, I have only been here a
few days and I have not had time for the full examination of my
papers by <persName>Congress</persName>. I found the <persName>government </persName>here fully informed,
(through the <persName>Governor of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>), of all that had been done in 
relation to the grant; the steps I had taken, and the progress of the
<placeName>settlement</placeName>&#8212; so far all seems satisfactory, and I can, I think, safely
assure you, that <persName>Congress </persName>will in a few days sanction all that has
been done, as well as the measures necessary to the future 
prosperity of the <placeName>settlement</placeName>.</p>

<p>We have just heard of the acknowledgement of the independence
of this <persName>government </persName>by the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#8212;an event exciting the most
lively sensations here&#8212;and fraught I hope, with solid and lasting
benefits to both nations.</p>

<p>The <persName>Congress </persName>here do business in good order and with great 
deliberation, though rather slow; and the most perfect harmony 
prevails, notwithstanding the existence of two parties, Imperial and
Republican.</p>

<p><persName>Gen. Iturbide</persName> seems to have the happiness of his <placeName>country </placeName>much
at heart, and I have no doubt he will act as a great and good man
ought to do.</p>

<p><persName>Gen. Wilkinson</persName> arrived here two days ago&#8212; you will be gratified
to learn he possesses the confidence of this <persName>government </persName>in a high 
degree, receives the most distinguished attentions, resides at the <placeName>house
of the Captain General of this province</placeName>, where he was waited on
shortly after his arrival by <persName>Gen. Iturbide</persName>, and the <persName>members of the
regency</persName>.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName>Irwin </persName>and <persName>Leftwich </persName>are here&#8212;their petition for a <placeName>grant </placeName>of
land is before <persName>Congress</persName>, and will be acted on in a few days.</p>

<p>There are also two <persName>European </persName>applicants for <persName>grants</persName>, one 
proposing the settlement of 5000 <persName>Irish emigrants</persName>, and the other 8000 
<persName>German</persName></p>

<p><persName>Gen. Trespelacias</persName> has been appointed <persName>Governor of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>. <persName>Gen.
Long</persName> was killed a short time since by a <persName>sentry</persName>&#8212;his <persName>family </persName>and his
men will, I think, be provided for.</p>

<p>I hope to set out for the <placeName>settlement in Texas</placeName>, in the course of ten
or twelve days.</p>

<p>With sentitments of sincere esteem I am, etc</p>

<p><persName>S. T. [F.] Austin</persName></p>

<p><persName>Jos. H. Hawkins, Esq.</persName></p>
<p><placeName>New Orleans.</placeName></p>
