<p>Dear <persName>Brother</persName>.</p>

<p>I wrote you from <placeName><persName>Mr Clark</persName>s</placeName> a few lines but the Musquitos were so
bad I could say but little.   I find this section of the country are very<pb n="793"/>
much dissatisfied at the appearance of being driyen out of the 
country. It appears the <persName><hi rend="italic">American </hi>Settlers</persName> fowarded a petition on to
<placeName>Bexar </placeName>requesting information on certain points&#8212;<persName>Mr Dill</persName> and <persName>Gains</persName>&#8212;
state the Deputation treated it with much contempt&#8212;declared every
man should either move on to the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>or leave the <placeName>Country </placeName>this
has exasperated the people very much&#8212; The general opinion here
is that you and the <persName>Baron </persName>are the Cause of it&#8212;consequently they are
much exasperated against you&#8212; There are also many reporte in
circulation as respects the certainty of your grant etc etc&#8212;this part
of the country is settled by Industrious <persName>farmers</persName> who have opened
<persName>large farms</persName> which are in a fine state of cultivation in fact if the
<placeName>Brazos </placeName>was settled by just such it would be a fine thing for us all&#8212;
the intention of many of those who are settled here was to move on
to the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>&#8212;but owing to the late order they are determined not
to do so at present. I have convinced all I have conversed with on
the subject that you feel as lively an interest for the <persName>American 
Settlers</persName> of good character that are established here as on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>&#8212;
<persName>Mr McNeils son</persName> expects to go on to the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>in the course of a
few weeks you can satisfy him as respects your Inocence of the
[order].... [torn] it would be satisfactory to many and many
of them would go to the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>.&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mr MeNiel</persName> states that some one must have made a 
misrepresentation to you respecting his disposition towards you&#8212;he intends 
writing you by a Gentleman who starts on in a few days&#8212;<persName>B. Baily</persName> when
in this <placeName>Settlement </placeName>behaved himself in a most shameful Manner&#8212;
and when he started <persName>Mr McN.</persName> missed some of his horses&#8212;it is 
supposed he (B) took them and sold them for cattle&#8212;a man by the name
of <persName>Lynch&#8212;Baker&#8212;Lane</persName>&#8212;<persName>horse thieves</persName>&#8212;is said to have gone with
him.&#8212; I find that <persName>Baily </persName>being permitted to remain in the country&#8212;
and Bunch having murdered a man on the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>and permitted to
escape&#8212;and many other things&#8212;combined&#8212;discourage people from
moving into the country&#8212;and they stop here&#8212;I have nothing more
to say&#8212;to you&#8212;the <placeName>Sabine </placeName>has been higher than ever was known
<placeName>Capt. G</placeName>&#8212;states here that it is extremely doubtful whether the 
<persName>Settlers on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName></persName> will obtain rights for their lands</p>
