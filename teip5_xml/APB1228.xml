<p>This day <date when="1826-08-03">August 3 1826</date> in the Town of <placeName>San Felipe de Austin </placeName>
Personally appeared before me <persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName> Judge interim of this
Jurisdiction and commissioned by order of his Excellency the <persName>Govr
of the <placeName>State of Quahuila and Texas</placeName></persName> to enquire as to the marriage and
character of <persName>E B[ean]</persName></p>

<p><persName>Martin Allen</persName> a respectable and honorable <persName>inhabitant </persName>of this 
<placeName>Jurisdiction </placeName>who being duly Sworn to depose the truth as to what he<pb n="1398"/>
knows relative to Said <persName>Bean </persName>makes the following declaration&#8212;to
wit&#8212;that this <persName>deponent </persName>lived a number of years in the Same Section
of <placeName>Country </placeName>in the <placeName>Arkansas Territory</placeName> with Said <persName>Bean </persName>and was 
intimately acquainted with him and his <persName>family </persName>for Six years and was
frequently at his <placeName>house </placeName>both in <placeName>Arkansas </placeName>and on the <placeName>river Neches</placeName>
in the <placeName>district of Nacodoches</placeName> where he now lives&#8212;The Said <persName>Bean</persName>
had a <persName>wife </persName>when this <persName>deponent </persName>first saw him in <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, does not
know where he was married but believes in the <placeName>State of Tennessee</placeName>&#8212;
The common and universal belief of every one was that the said
<persName>Bean </persName>was legally married to his <persName>wife </persName>according to the laws of the
<placeName>country </placeName>where he lived&#8212;his <persName>Father in law</persName> was by the name of 
<persName>Metcalf </persName>and was well known to this deponent. He had the character of
respectable and honorable man and was a <persName>Justice of the Peace in
<placeName>Arkansas territory</placeName></persName>, and does not believe from the character and
standing of said <persName>Metcalf </persName>that he would have permitted the Said
<persName>Bean </persName>to live with his <persName>daughter </persName>unless they were legally married.</p>

<p>This deponent thinks <persName>Bean </persName>to be an honest man he is very fond
of boasting and telling large stories about his exploits in the 
Mexican revolution and said he was a <persName>Colonel of the regular army of
Mexico</persName>.</p>

<p>This <persName>deponent </persName>cannot positively state how many <persName>children </persName>Said <persName>B.
</persName>has at this time but believes he has three.</p>
