<p>I have received from <persName>Messrs Nathaniel Robins</persName> and <persName>Doctor Lewis
R Dayton</persName> the representation which you directed to me under date
of <date when="1827-02-20">20 february of the present year</date> in which you complain that 
<persName>officers from the Govt of the <placeName>United States of North America </placeName></persName>[are]
exacting from you taxes and Contributions which in your opinion
you ought not to pay on account of your being established on <placeName>Lands
of the Republic of Mexico</placeName>. At the same time petitioning 
protection and assistance from this <persName>Govt</persName>, as well to avoid those exactions
as for your defence against the incursions of the hostile <persName>Indians</persName>,
on which particular I have to state to you that it is not within the
bounds of my faculties to remidy the evils which afflict you not
knowing the place where the division line between the two 
<placeName>Republics </placeName>will fall. You must therefore in the meantime bear with 
patience the disgusts of such treatment with the understanding that
under this date I forward your representation to <persName>His Excellency
the Governor of this State</persName> asking of him the necessary <persName>auxilliaries</persName>
for that part of the <placeName>frontier </placeName>of which you will undoubtedly reap
[an advantage] should your fate decide that you are [to be a part
of] <placeName>Mexican Territory</placeName>. In which event, I [do not see] any 
objection to your provissionally forming and until the decission of the
<persName>Supreme Govt</persName>, is given to your representation all the branches of
organised government under a system already known and regulated
by the laws which you are acquainted with until those of the 
<placeName>Country </placeName>which you wish to adopt are furnished to you.</p>
