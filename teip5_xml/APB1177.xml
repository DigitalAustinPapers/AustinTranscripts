<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1826-06-15">15th June 1826</date></p>
<p>My Dear <persName>Sister</persName>,
</p>
<p>I have not written you since my return from the <placeName>Interior </placeName>owing
to a suitable conveyance not having presented itself And my being
compelled to go out on an <persName>Indian </persName>excursion shortly after my arrival&#8212;
We returned without being able to effect any thing owing to the 
inclemancy of the season and the <persName>Indians </persName>having left their <placeName>Villages</placeName>'&#8212;
We apprehend no danger fron the <persName>Indians </persName>their numbers are too
small to harass us in any other way than by Stealing a few horses&#8212;
which they do occasionally&#8212; During my abscence my <persName>brother </persName>
received a letter from you dated in<date n="01-xx-1826"> January last</date> containing the 
unpleasant intelligence of the loss of many of our <persName>friends</persName>&#8212;within the
last year, a loss more afflicting to us owing to the few that are left
of what was but a few years since a numerous and happy Circle&#8212;¦
I fear that by the time my <persName>Brother </persName>and myself can return to 
<placeName>Missouri </placeName>we shall find but few of our old <persName>friends </persName>alive&#8212;</p>

<p>Our <placeName>Colony </placeName>is improving daily the emigration that has taken
place lately has been principally by water&#8212; Vessels arrive&#8212;or
touch<placeName> at the mouth of this river </placeName>frequently and two will ply
regularly between this and <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>; I entertain but little
doubt that a passage could be procured at almost any time; Should
<persName>Mr Perry</persName> wish to come out to visit the <placeName>Country </placeName>either this <date n="Fall - 1826">fall </date>or
<date n="Spring- 1827">next spring</date> I would advise him to come by water&#8212; The last
Vessel was only 5&#8212;-days from the <placeName>City </placeName>and three&#8212;from the <placeName>Balize</placeName>
to the <placeName>mouth of the river</placeName>.</p>

<p>Our crops are very promising this Season&#8212; Considerable 
cotton will be made&#8212;which will be inferior to none made in any part
of the <placeName>US</placeName>&#8212; All that is wanting to make this the most desirable
part of the habitable <placeName>Globe </placeName>is a Sufficient population&#8212;which it
must have in a few years&#8212;</p>

<p>I am happy to hear that the <persName>boys </persName>improve, I hope you will not
neglect placing them as soon as they are old enough in a Situation
whereby they may acquire a thorough knowledge of business</p>

<p>Have you done any thing in the <placeName>Durham Hall</placeName>&#8212;business yet&#8212;?
what does <persName>Mr Perry</persName> think of the probability of recovering it&#8212; If
any thing is done I think it ought to be done immediately&#8212;</p>

<p>I have nothing more to communicate at present <persName>Brother </persName>is well&#8212;
I wish you to send out the work of <persName>Schoolcrafts </persName>it would be 
gratifying to us to see it&#8212; Give my respects to all my old <persName>friends</persName>-
Kiss little <persName>Mary</persName>&#8212; and tell <persName>Jack </persName>his <persName>uncle </persName>will expect a letter from
him shortly&#8212;    Before I close I must inform you of the death of<pb n="1359"/>
<persName>Thomas Alley</persName>  he was unfortunately drowned -crossing the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>
on our last Campaign against the <persName>Indians</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Old <persName>Mr- Andrews</persName> was well the last time I heard from him&#8212;</p>

<p>I leave this on the 06-16-1826
for my place down the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>&#8212; probably
 I shall not have an opportunity of writing you for Some
time&#8212; The <persName>Murderer </persName>of <persName>William Perry</persName> has not reached this part
of the <placeName>Province </placeName>yet&#8212; the last information I received he was on
<hi rend="italic">Red River</hi> in <placeName>Arkensas Terry</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas B. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Mrs- Emily M Perry</persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>P. S. I am not married yet and <persName>Stephen </persName>is further from it than
he was <date n="01-xx-1826">six months ago</date></p>

<p><persName>JB A</persName></p>
<p>your letter was truly welcome for I have not heard from you for
many months&#8212; you say nothing about moving&#8212; neither can I
give you any other advice on the subject, than what I have 
heretofore said which is, that I wish <persName>Mr Perry</persName> to come and look for 
himself before he determines&#8212; I am Satisfied to spend my life here,
but I should be much more so if you were with us&#8212; Our crops this
year are much more abundant than they have been since the <placeName>Colony</placeName>
commenced&#8212; the Season has been very favourable, if any thing
rather too wet, particularly the beginning of this month&#8212; 
remember me to all friends and particularly <persName>Mrs. John Perry</persName> and all the
<persName>Perry family</persName> etc. write often and give all the <placeName>Potosi </placeName>news in 
detail&#8212; we Still live in <placeName>log cabins</placeName>&#8212; rather poor, tho plenty of
corn Beef and Bacon&#8212; Kiss the <persName>Children </persName>for their <persName>uncle</persName></p>

<p><persName>Stephen</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:]<persName> Mrs Emily M. Perry</persName> <placeName>Potosi Missouri</placeName>   Mail</p>
