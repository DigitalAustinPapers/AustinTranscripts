<p><persName>Mr. J. F. Perry</persName> -</p>
<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>As I have determined not to go to the meeting at <placeName>Columbia </placeName>to day it may
be well to prevent a misunderstanding of my course to say what it has
been and what it is now&#8212;</p>

<p>I have been opposed to the plan of taking <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> without first
consulting the <persName>people</persName>&#8212; It was certainly premature and contrary to the
spirit of our education&#8212;because we have not been taught to believe, that
a few ought to controll the destiny of all&#8212;be their motives what they may&#8212;
In all matters where the <hi rend="italic">all </hi>are interested, <hi rend="italic">all </hi>should be consulted and by
a clearly expressed will of the majority the ballance should be governed&#8212;
Because I am opposed to the plan, of <hi rend="italic">a few </hi>at <placeName>San Felipi</placeName> it has been said
that "I am a disappointed <persName>land speculator</persName>" if it ware so it was my 
misfortune or my good fortune&#8212; It matters not&#8212; It might also be said that
those who were so anxious for the plan of the few at <placeName>San Felipi</placeName> "ware
not disappointed<persName> land speculators</persName>" the one would as likely be true as
the other&#8212;but I impune no mans motives this is not the way to get at
<hi rend="italic">truth</hi>&#8212; one should not be too ready to suspect the motives of each other&#8212;
It is certain that there is some excitement in the <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212; I am sorry for
it&#8212; I am sure I know the cause&#8212;but how are we to remedy it&#8212;not by
strife among ourselves&#8212; we must be united&#8212; and there is but one way
that I can see to effect that object&#8212;a meeting of the <persName>people </persName>by their 
<persName>delligates</persName>&#8212; If they desire to defeat the "<persName>land speculators</persName>" no better way can
be thought of that I can see&#8212; The <persName>people </persName>will have all in their own
hands&#8212; I am not at present in favour of a convention, because I think
we shall be alone&#8212;<hi rend="italic">but if the majority say convention so say</hi> I but I am
for disunion with our other half, who have made it their business for the
last 2 or 3 years to ruin us&#8212; I am not in favour of supporting any of the
<hi rend="italic"><persName>ex state authorities</persName></hi>&#8212;but shall be in favour of a clean turne and declare for
our selves&#8212; We cannot make parte of a defense&#8212; We must go the whole
or none at all&#8212; I am persuaded the <persName>people </persName>will not fight for those who
have been their worst <persName>enemies</persName>&#8212; They have all in their own hands and
can do as they please I will go with my <persName>countrymen</persName>right or wrong&#8212;
all I have shall be pledged for our common defense</p>
