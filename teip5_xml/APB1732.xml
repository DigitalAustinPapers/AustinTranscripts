<p><placeName>Cincinnati </placeName><date when="1829-07-18">18 July 1829</date></p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I received your very welcome favor of <date when="1829-05-29">29 May</date> but <date when="1829-07-17">yesterday</date>&#8212;it
came by mail from <placeName>Orleans</placeName> and I have not heard a Syllable of the
<persName>Doctor </persName>and his <persName>lovely Bride</persName>&#8212; <persName>Major Lewis</persName> has this moment left
me and is on the wing for the <placeName>Brasos </placeName>I regret exceedingly that I
have not more time to devote to my <placeName>Texas </placeName><persName>friends </persName>by this very
favorable opportunity&#8212; You mention having received one letter
and some <placeName>newspapers </placeName>why I have written a dozen or thereabouts
and sent as many packages of papers To <persName>League </persName>I have written
oftener and Sent more papers and I have not yet received one line
from him&#8212;- I hope the <hi rend="italic"><persName>Sovereigns </persName></hi>will be <hi rend="italic">divil </hi>him worse then
ever&#8212; he Is a Shabby fellow-
Have you heard of the terrible <persName>Havanna Armada</persName>&#8212; are you
prepared for it&#8212; I believe It is all Smoke or will end so&#8212; or
perhaps is designed as a Scare-crow to obtain a favorable 
commercial treaty privileges etc on condition of recognition&#8212;</p>

<p>I am fully sensible of the necessity of being In my <placeName>Colony </placeName>and
design to repair there as soon as practicable The late disturbance
at <placeName>Mexico </placeName>gave me a verv serious back set from which it has been
difficult to recover&#8212; I had a very respectable <persName>company </persName>in full
progress of formation when the news of war and revolutions and
insurrections dispersed them like a hawk pouncing upon a flock of<pb n="229"/>
pigeons . . . probably . . . [Torn] Short interval of repose has
been granted to the <hi rend="italic"><persName>powers </hi>of <placeName>Mexico </placeName></persName>I pray that repose may be
continued to an age of ages&#8212;</p>

<p>You paid <persName>Buckner </persName>5$ more than you had <hi rend="italic">any right to do</hi>&#8212;and I
request <persName>League </persName>will refund you that much for I cannot allow my
<persName>friends </persName>to pay <hi rend="italic">for </hi>me, more than they owe to me and you have paid
5$ more than you owed&#8212;ergo, it must be returned.</p>

<p>I beg you will present to my estimable friend <persName>Brown</persName>, my warmest
congratulations on his <hi rend="italic">duplication </hi>and I sincerely hope the <persName>little
fellow</persName> may inherit all the beauty of his <persName>mother </persName>the goodness of
his <persName>father</persName>, the intelligence of his <persName>Uncle</persName>, and the immortality of the
blessed&#8212;</p>

<p>I hope <persName>Williams'little daughter </persName>will not put my little friend
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Vic</persName>'s </hi>nose out-of-joint, as the saying is&#8212; Remember me to <persName>Williams</persName>
and his <persName>wife</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Your letter has releived my mind of one very serious bother, for
I have suffered more inquietude concerning my little debt to friend
<persName>Buckner </persName>than it was worth&#8212; I am truly pleased to hear that the
<persName>Empresario </persName>has got into vogue with the <persName>sovereigns </persName>and the more so
because I Know how unpleasant it is to be subject even to the 
malicious and gratuitous censures of the stupid the vile and the unjust&#8212;
and I hope, as he has acquired, so he will preserve his popularity
with the mutation . . . [Torn off]</p>

<p>I expect most confidently to be in <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>early in the <date n="Fall - 1829">fall</date>&#8212;
<persName>Milam </persName>and myself are endeavoring to form a <persName>company </persName>for 
colonization and <hi rend="italic">mining </hi>purposes&#8212;and have a very fair prospect of 
Success&#8212;in getting the company&#8212;</p>

<p>I have not time to write to <persName>League </persName>without hazarding the loss of
the present very favorable oppy&#8212; Be good enough to tell him&#8212;if
he has any Surplus funds of mine, to transmit them by the first good
oppy to my friend <persName>James Loccard Com. Mercht at <placeName>New Orleans </placeName></persName>and
to request <persName>Loccard </persName>to remit them to me at this place provided they
reach him by the <date when="1829-10-01">first of October</date>&#8212; Remember me to all <persName>friends</persName>-
May God bless you and give you prosperity here, and eternal felicity
hereafter&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>David G. Burnet  </persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>I have not heard from <persName>Fullerton</persName>, directly, in a long time&#8212;he is
still at <placeName>Chillicothe</placeName>&#8212;</p>
