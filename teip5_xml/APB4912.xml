<p>During the present interesting period in the affairs of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it is very
evident that <placeName>facility of communication</placeName> between the different sections of the
country is all important; indeed it is always so, but at this time the best
interest of the cause of the <persName>people </persName>clearly requires, that there should be a
regular mail between <placeName>this country</placeName> and the <placeName>United States frontier</placeName>, by way of
<placeName>Harrisburg</placeName>, <placeName>Liberty </placeName>and <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, as well for the purpose of 
communication with the <persName>people of the latter places</persName>, as also for that of 
informing our <persName>friends and brethren in the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>, of the interesting events
now passing in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;events which can not fail to enlist the moral and
physical aid of the free and magnanimous of <placeName>all nations</placeName>.</p>

<p>Mail routes to <placeName>Velasco</placeName>, <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>, <placeName>Washington</placeName>, <placeName>Bastrop</placeName>, <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>and
other places are equally important, and are also recommended to be 
established as soon as the funds of the <persName>department </persName>will be sufficient to defray
the expenses.</p>

<p>Animated by these considerations of public good, the <persName>committee of 
Vigilence of <placeName>Austin</placeName></persName> recommend.</p>

<p>1st. The establishment of a <persName>provisional post Office department</persName>, and that
<persName>John Rice Jones</persName>, whose well known integrity and long experience as <persName>post
master in the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName>, eminently qualifies him for such a station, be
placed at the head of it.</p>

<p>2nd. That a general subscription be opened and put in circulation
under the superintendance of said <persName>director</persName>, to raise funds to defray the
expenses of carrying weekly mails, Commencing with that to the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>
above mentioned, and extending it to other places as soon as the resources
of the <persName>department </persName>will permit.</p>

<p>3rd. That, in order, to insure system, and a correct <persName>administration </persName>of this
important <persName>department</persName>, the director be invested with full powers to make
provisional rules and regulations, and fix the rate of Postage on letters and
papers, that are not on public service; and to appoint such <persName>post masters</persName><pb n="160"/>
at the different places where they may be necessary. But such 
appointments are always to be made in conformity with the recommendation of
the <persName>committee of Correspondence</persName> of said places.</p>

<p>4th. That it be the duty of said <persName>director </persName>to keep an exact account of all
the receipts and disbursements of the <persName>department </persName>and to make all contracts
for carrying the mail, and generally to superintend and direct everything
connected with the <persName>department</persName>&#8212;he being liable always to render an 
account of his acts to the competent authority when one is established by the
<persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>. It being understood that the private subscriptions are to
be refunded whenever the funds of the <persName>department </persName>will permit.</p>

<p>5th. That said <persName>director </persName>correspond with <persName>all the committees of safety of
<placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> on this subject without delay; requesting their co-operation, and
transmitting to them, copies of this proceeding</p>
