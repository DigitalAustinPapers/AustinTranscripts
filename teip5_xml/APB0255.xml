<p>My Dear <persName>Son</persName></p>

<p>This will be handed you by <persName>Mr Frizzel a Gentleman from 
<placeName>Boston</placeName></persName> <persName>Mr Frizzel</persName> wishes to Purchase Lead. I have told him that I
could Not Sell any but that I thought you would I have therefore
refer'd him to you I have wrote <persName>Mr Henry <hi rend="italic">Schell </hi></persName>that the money
promices [promised] should be sent him in ten days, the Waggon
Starts <date when="1814-11-25">this morning</date> in companey with <persName>Been Brown</persName> the Lead She
takes I sold to <persName>Mr Wilkinson</persName> to send on to <persName>Stephen </persName>and I have sent
of <persName>John J Bricky</persName> to <placeName>RussellsVille </placeName>to see <persName>Stephen </persName>and help him
should he make the purchase. I had to send to <persName>Cape </persName>to engage my
Pork an article I find will be difficult to obtain this year and I
thought best to make safe in time I am told Pork can be contracted
for at or Near <placeName><persName>Eathman</persName>s ferry on the Mississippia</placeName> which would be
with in 4 Days of <persName>Stephen </persName>and I have given New instructions to
him on the Subject of <persName>Negroes </persName>which I am determin'd to take at
about 24 Thousand for <hi rend="italic">52</hi> this will bring the <persName>Men </persName>at 600 Dollars
<persName>Women </persName>at 500 <persName>Children </persName>from <hi rend="italic">200 275 and 300</hi> In consiquence I have
sent forward proper Securety for the <persName>Negroes</persName>. If Ever there was
a time that would Justify a high Price for <persName>Negroes </persName>It's at this
moment Lead must be up the demand is great and <hi rend="italic">750 </hi>is given.
If you can sell Lead for 800 Dollars I think I can make out the
balance If <persName>Scott </persName>doth Not disappoint me   as I have sent on money to<pb n="244"/>
<persName>Stephen </persName>you will not send any I have also Bought myself a Horse
which will answer me for <hi rend="italic">60 </hi>Dollars&#8212;<persName>Stapels </persName>may come as soon
as he pleases, all well at the <placeName>Hall </placeName>Expect you in a few days I hope
<persName>Mr Elias Bates</persName> has much mend'd and that things goes on much better
at <placeName>Herculaneum</placeName></p>

<p>I wish you to see If you can make a Contract for Corn If I
can Purchase Corn at <placeName>Herculaneum </placeName>It will save all the Hawling as
the Waggon could bring back a return Load with this expense I
am inclined to think <persName>Stephen </persName>will make the Purchase of <persName>Negroes </persName>and
in that case many buffelow <persName>Robs </persName>will be wanted and much provisions
I shall want 600 bushells for Bread alone and 10 Thousand pound
for Pork&#8212;You know that in the payments to <persName>Henry Sckell</persName> the Silver
must be taken and If Nothing better could be don I think we could
Exchange 800 Dollars with <persName>Mr Duglass </persName>at <placeName>St. Louis</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Mr Haskal</persName> wrote <persName>Mr Elliott</persName> that he wanted a <placeName>school</placeName>&#8212;you may tell
him that a school can be obtained for him on that subject <persName>Mr
Elliott</persName> has wrote him</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James Bryan</persName> <placeName>Herculaneum</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Moses Austin</persName></p>
