<p><placeName>Ayish Bayou District</placeName> <date when="1826-11-05"> Nov. 5. 1826</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Understanding that complaints have been made to yon by <persName>James
Gaines</persName>, respecting some of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of your <placeName>colony</placeName>, who he
has represented, have written letters to <persName>citizens </persName>of this <placeName>District </placeName>
calculated to excite dissaffection to the laws and the government, I
herein inclose the letters which gave rise to this complaint. They are
written you will see, by my old <persName>neighbors </persName>and <persName>friends</persName>, Messrs 
<persName>Thompson </persName>and <persName>Payton</persName>, and not, as <persName>Capt. Gaines</persName> imagined by <persName>Mr White</persName>.</p>

<p>The leters were brought to me from <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>by <persName>Gaines</persName>, who,
when he delivered them, remarked that the handwriting was <persName>Squire
Whites</persName>', and desired me to permit him to read them. Finding that
they contained intelligence which I was requested to keep a secret,
and knowing <persName>Gaines </persName>of all men in the world to be the most unfit to be
trusted with one, I refused. Immediately his fruitful and 
disturbed imagination gave birth to the most dreadful suspicion and
he saw at once, in vision, the <placeName>peaceful fields of the Ayish Bayou,
</placeName>a prey to all the horrors of rebellion. Its indeed unfortunate that
we are debarred the privilege of friendly and confidential 
correspondence without incurring the imputation of treasonable designs.</p>

<p>I avail myself of the same opportunity to send you a copy of a
letter written by <persName>Capt. Gaines</persName> to the <persName>Governor </persName>at <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>. It needs
no comment. You will see that he has proscribed some of the most
respectable <persName>inhabitants </persName>of this <placeName>District </placeName>as well as yourself, and that
even an aged and defenceless <persName>female </persName>could not escape the poison of
his malice.</p>

<p><persName>Jn° Sprowl</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Stephen Austin Esq</persName>. <placeName>San Felipe de Austin Coahuila
&amp; Texas</placeName>&#8212;</p>
