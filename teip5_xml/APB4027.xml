<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>On conversing with <persName>Miss Hambleton</persName> since your departure from
here she thinks that writing to <placeName>new york</placeName> before some inteligence
can be received from <placeName>Tennessee </placeName>will give her some unnecessary
trouble in setting the business in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, the injustice and
littigation which takes place frequently in probates of the <placeName>united
states</placeName> make plane cases doubtful It is evedent to me from private
conversation with <persName><hi rend="italic">doc</hi>. Hambleton</persName> that what property he may have
had in <placeName>Tennessee </placeName>is no inheritence of his <persName>Fathers</persName>, but of his own<pb n="488"/>
accumulating and no doubt but she (his widow) was considered
by him as the most dear and if so of course she ought to enjoy some
of his property&#8212;</p>

<p>However she having confidence in your judgment and the 
knowledg you have of the laws of that government will leave it with
you to not write at present or to write&#8212;</p>

<p>one question on this subject has caused some doubts withe me (viz)
By what authority Marriages are solamised in the <placeName>colones</placeName>, whether
the state legislator has enacted it or whether it has become a law
by costóme; this is a question I ask in confidence and now doubt
remains if the Legislator hav anacted it of it being valied in any
Government.   But if grown in to a law by costom it must be invalied</p>

<p>I cannot close this without mentione one subject which I view
of some importance to the genral good of the Government and to
the <persName>colonest </persName>that is The establishing some <persName>ecclesiastic authority
</persName>with out some religion man is But little above the animal creation,
I need not say nor compair the <persName>colonest </persName>to animal (or brutes) they
have a theory of religion without practice why Habit and costom
has taught them to discard the <persName>Roman Catholic</persName> Doctrine nor could
they be prevaild on to be reconciled to it Nor are they alowd to
practice their one [own] theory publickly:</p>

<p>Now to remove a prejudice which is in the brest of the <persName>colonests</persName>
and to prove that the government do not wish to oppress them or
cúrtale or infringe upon their consciences whould be to appoint
some <persName>eccleiastical man</persName> whome the <persName>colonest </persName>mite recommend. This
would have the double effect it would have a tendency on the
part of the <persName>colonest </persName>to adhere closely to the municapal laws or
sivil and Military and would incourage industry and incourage
avirtuous and industrous emigration. By a carfuil policy on the
part of him to whom this trust rests (?) would ultemately prove
their was no inequity or injiery arising from the institution to
the government.</p>

<p>I am aware that this is a subject which ought to be touched in
confidence and judgement I am well aware of superstition ignorance
and misrepresentations in the world: and if the name of a 
<persName>Presbyterian </persName>could opperate prejudicial to conduce to the general welfare
of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>or a <persName>Roman </persName>why not assume it.</p>

<p>But farther it would matter but little of what profession a <persName>Preacher</persName>
is of with the <persName>colonest </persName>so he be a <persName>protestant </persName>and if the doctrins of
the <persName>Presbyterians </persName>are more favourable to the <persName>Roman </persName>Doctrins it
would give me pleasure and joy to render my services and spend my
substance in doing good to the world of mankind and to reconcile
governments or communities and doing a gineral good I could bend
greatly even to circumcise etc etc&#8212;<pb n="489"/></p>

<p>your Election is the cause of much gratification in this <placeName>colony </placeName>people
or expecting much to be done Ignorant of the Powers of a 
representative. I beg leave here to make one remark and hope you will
consider it as comeing from the heart of one who wishes that good
of all and particular your self the <persName>colonest </persName>will expect every thing
the <persName>Mexicans </persName>will be jealous; the safist path is nutral ground.
Intelagance reason and judgement there is no difficulty with</p>

<p>I am disposed to advise with those who is able to instruct me in
policy and genral good to which I appeal to your judgement and
await your answer,   No more</p>

<p><persName>Sumner Bacon</persName></p>

<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>the first Clauses of this leter is written by the request of <persName>Mis
Hambleton </persName>any instructions or reasons(?) you may give will be
thankfully received through me                                     </p>
<p><persName>S Bacon</persName></p>
