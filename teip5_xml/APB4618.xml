<p><persName>Mr. Geo: Fisher</persName></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Matamoros</hi></p>

<p>Dr Sir.    The affairs of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, which have given me labor and
vexation enough for 13 years past, are likely, as it seems to keep
me in difficulties for some time to come.   The fact is, that during
the last year of general convulsions, it has been almost impossible<pb n="1037"/>
for any one, who occupies any space in Society, to Keep clear of
extanglements of some kind. I have been arrested by an Order from
the <persName>Minister of War</persName>, on an accusation made by the <persName>State 
Government</persName>, and I leave <date when="1834-01-16">to morrow</date>, I presume for <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>

<p>All I can be accused of is that I have labored diligently and 
faithfully and with pure intentions to cover the<placeName> wilderness of Texas</placeName> with
an agricultural and usefull <persName>population </persName>and to make it a <placeName>State of the
Mexican Republic</placeName>, separate from <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>. This is no crime,&#8212;it
is quite the reverse.</p>

<p>I have sent some claims in that <hi rend="italic">Comisaria</hi>, to <persName>D. W. Smith</persName>, to 
collect, and as you are the <persName><hi rend="italic">Comisario</hi></persName> I recommend them for <hi rend="italic">pronto
despacho</hi>.</p>

<p>I am much pleased with the new <persName>Comandante General, Don Pedro
Lemus</persName>, and I recommend him as a man of high honor and liberal
principles and a Gentleman.</p>

<p>The letters I wrote to <placeName>Texas </placeName>from <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>in your favor
caused a great excitement there, in many, against me&#8212;if you go
there you must be very prudent and accommodating as to <placeName>Custom
House</placeName> matters,&#8212;the best way is to let the <placeName>Custom House</placeName> alone
for a year more, and then go there,&#8212;or before as an Individual and
remove old impressions. I am getting tired of the whole matter
of Colonizing&#8212;all work and trouble and no profit or credit, for
many of them, that are benefitted by me, abuse me. The Basis
of the policy which the <placeName>State of Tamaulipas</placeName> ought to adopt
should be&#8212;<hi rend="italic">the <placeName>Country </placeName>needs population</hi>, and all their laws should
tend to encourage immigration to that <placeName>State</placeName>, from the <placeName>interior</placeName>
and <placeName>foreign countries</placeName>, especially the latter.</p>

<p>I received one letter from you in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin.</persName></p>

<p>A true copy of the original in my possession, which I certify</p>

<p><persName>Geo. Fisher</persName>.</p>
