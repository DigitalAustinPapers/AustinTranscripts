<p><placeName>New York</placeName> <date when="1835-11-15">Nov 15 1835</date></p>

<p>My Dear Sir.</p>

<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1835-09-30">30 Sep</date> has just arrived. I was impatient to hear
from you.</p>

<p>Public Sentiment is aroused for your cause. We know that you are
Bone of our Bone! and Flesh of our Flesh! that none but a <persName>Republican
Government</persName> can exist over you!</p>

<p>But by the Law of Nations, by Treaty with <placeName>Mexico </placeName>we cannot yet 
interfere.&#8212;</p>

<p>You will conduct your affairs with the justice and courage which led our
<persName>Fathers in the Revolution</persName> to establish the equal rights which we now
enjoy&#8212;tens of thousands will join you, and with you, lay the firm 
foundations of your <placeName>Republic</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>Govermt </persName>can hardly do for you what private opinion and zeal is already
active in doing.</p>

<p>You will respect all <hi rend="italic">private rights</hi> acquired under your former system
and not forfeited by <hi rend="italic">Hostility</hi>.</p>

<p>My intimate connexion with the <persName>Secretary of State</persName> forbids (now) my
public appearance in your behalf&#8212;but I am not idle.</p>

<p>(Confidential)</p>
<p>the <persName>Secretary of State</persName> (a few days ago) told me that there was but one
result for your affairs&#8212;and that was, a natural and inevitable connexion
with the Policy and Interests of <hi rend="italic">your country the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</hi></p>

<p>I admire your whole course of Conduct in relation to <persName>Texan </persName>affairs It
is generous, brave and above all things else, it is just to Republican 
principles&#8212;it is truly Equitable.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you as often as possible.</p>

<p>My <persName>wife Julia </persName>begs me to send her Love to you and say that she has
never forgotten the time when you at five years of age was her companion
in the City of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. I have heard her speak of you with 
affection these 30 years.</p>

<p>May the Almighty protect you and your <persName>Republican Brethren</persName> in your
progress to that glorious Independence which is in my Mind's Eye not
only Before you But very near to you.</p>

<p><persName>H. Meigs</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
