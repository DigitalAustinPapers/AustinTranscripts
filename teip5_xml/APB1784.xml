<p><placeName>Cerralvo </placeName><date when="1829-11-09">9th Nov. 1829</date></p>
<p><persName>Col Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir; we arrivd at this <placeName>place </placeName>a few days since and found
<persName>Cameron </persName>here, and both <persName>Mr. Sharkey</persName> and Myself being unwell
nothing was said on business until we got better; <date when="1829-11-07">day before 
yesterday</date> <persName>Mr Sharkey</persName> sent for him, and informed him he was ready to
attend to business, and it was necessary first for us <persName>Cameron </persName>and
myself to come to a proper understanding, as to our affaires &#8212;</p>

<p>I then namd to him that I had formd a <persName>company </persName>in <placeName>Battinson</placeName>, to
work <placeName>Certain Mines </placeName>by authority invested in me by an Instrument
of writing, with his signature to it, I ask him if he claimd an interest
in the <persName>company</persName>, he said he did; I then ask him if that was his hand
writing and if it containd his signature, he quivocated as much
as he could at last he acknowledged his signature, but would not
admit its vilidity; but stated it was void long since and said it never
was intended to of been usd&#8212;but to give more confidence, in aiding
me in forming the <persName>Company</persName>. He said he would allow me an interest
in those <placeName>Mines </placeName>the <persName>Company </persName>had contracted to work alluding to
the two <placeName>mines </placeName>in the Contract but as to allowing me an interest in
other <placeName>Mines </placeName>he would not except some at <persName>Yguana </persName>he naimd these
I might have an interest some naming them and more over he
would not admit of any cantract he ever had mad with me, that
he was not to be drove or compeld to do any thing by me&#8212;- of
all the lying quivocating <persName>schondrals </persName>he beats all I ever saw&#8212;he said
when he gave the Instrument he cold not Deny ownin <placeName>Mines </placeName>in his
own name notwithstanding he bound himself to do so, this was
fraud within its self, <pb n="283"/></p>

<p><date when="1829-11-11">day after tomorrow</date> <persName>Mr Sharkey</persName> and myself intends seting out
for <placeName>Mounterey </placeName>to precure all the legal information necessary both for
myself and to satisfy himself as to the interest of the <persName>Company</persName>.&#8212;
The tools reach this place four days before we did, and if it was not
for <persName>Cameron</persName>s rascalaty we could commence our Mining operations in
a week,&#8212;I should like for <persName>Mr. Williams</persName> to hold himself in readiness,
to come to my assistance in case much difficulty, I will advise you as
soon as its practable&#8212;<persName>Cameron </persName>observed the reason he came on from
<placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and not meeting us, he heard some news that huried him off&#8212;
he has secured the <placeName>Mines</placeName>, I understand from him, as also from
others,&#8212;If aney thing remains undone that would promote my 
interest in this business, dont fail to attend to it, he bids defiance as to
my suing him,&#8212;If sufficient information could be procured to git the
Govt, to call on him as respects his remarks respecting a seperat
<placeName>Republic</placeName>, it might be of service to me, as he depends so much on his
influence both with the individuals here and the Govt.&#8212;any services
rendered me will be thankfully reed</p>

<p><persName>Robt Lewis. </persName>[Rubric]</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr Samuel M. Williams </persName>  <placeName>Villa de Austin. Texas</placeName></p>
