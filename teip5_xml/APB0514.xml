<p><date when="1822-05-31">May 31. 1822</date></p>
<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have wrote you so repeatedly and so fully that I have some
difficulty in determining what subject now to undertake.</p>

<p>You will have visited <placeName>Mexico </placeName>at a most eventful and Auspicious
moment&#8212;</p>

<p>Have things resulted as you desired? Do they now stand on a
sane and permanent basis?</p>

<p>I send you a letter inclosed directed to myself&#8212;It is from <persName>Rielly</persName>
at <placeName>Mexico</placeName>-&#8212;open and read it.</p>

<p>He could not comprehend why I recommended<persName> Ervine [Erwin]</persName>
and his views&#8212;I wrote you fully on this subject&#8212;I took a share in
<persName>E's Compy</persName>. It was necessary to do so&#8212;They would have left here
otherwise with feelings of hostility&#8212;</p>

<p>I have a written stipulation that my membership and agency was
recd with a knowledge of my interest in your <placeName>grant</placeName>, and that nothing
was desired or expected not promotive of your interests. The fact
is that their success is yours&#8212;As to the respective value of the
grants, that will depend on local advantages&#8212;To make <persName>Carrol </persName>and
others <persName>friends </persName>who were to be our <persName>neighbors </persName>was no small affair&#8212;
Having mentioned <persName>Carroll</persName>s names it is necessary to remind you He
has been and will continue our friend&#8212;and wishes to be our 
<persName>neighbour</persName>&#8212;You will provide for him accordingly&#8212;</p>

<p>I told <persName>Genl. <hi rend="italic">R </hi></persName>... on <date when="1822-05-30">yesterday </date>that <persName>Genl. Trespalacios</persName> had no
ground or cause of Complaint agt you or your friends, and that I
blamed him <persName>R</persName>, with the bad feelings (if any now existed) which
might be displayed&#8212;</p>

<p>I hope most sincerely you had an opportunity of meeting <persName>Genl. 
Trespalacios</persName> in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. I need make no comments on the facts disclosed
by the letter from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;<pb n="521"/></p>

<p>There will be men around <persName>Gl. T</persName>&#8212;who would gladly injure you&#8212;
You need no admonition from me on this subject&#8212;Your good sense
and firmness will point out the Course</p>

<p>I have received very many letters to you&#8212;all of which I have
opened and read Some you [I] have sent by the <hi rend="italic">Only Son </hi>The rest
I retain and shall answer for you in the most laconic manner to be
civil&#8212;The business is becoming too <hi rend="italic">weighty </hi>to be prolix.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to repeat&#8212;our disbursements now exceed
$7,000&#8212;including the provisions shipped, and my interest in the
<hi rend="italic">Only Son </hi>I was compelled to sell one half&#8212;the vessel, and may be
forced to sell the other.</p>

<p>This is of no moment should success attend your efforts&#8212;It would
afford me sincere gratification to say when and where we could meet&#8212;
I would even go to you&#8212;could I be assured that all was well.</p>

<p>The glimmerings of hope sometimes break in upon me, and the
visions are almost golden&#8212;I do [not] mean the sordid acquisition of
wealth&#8212;but release from debt in other words freedom&#8212;To die a
<persName>slave </persName>would be insupportable&#8212;To leave as the only legacy to my
<persName>children </persName><hi rend="italic">hungry <persName>creditors</persName></hi> would be to have lived in vain and die
miserable</p>

<p>I have pursuaded <persName>Mrs Hawkins</persName> to look to and rely on you as the
firmest pillar in our <hi rend="italic">building</hi>&#8212;She speaks of you in kindness but
sometimes says she expects to upbraid you with having taken her
<persName>Husband </persName>from the only sure path for him&#8212;his trade- I am much
pressed for time and the <persName>Capt of the vessel</persName> has called.</p>

<p><persName>J H Hawkins</persName></p>

<p><persName>Judge S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>This will be delivered you by <persName>Mr Beardslee</persName> the <persName>Brother of the
Editor of the advitiser</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>He is an amiable Young Man&#8212;in delicate health&#8212;I have induced
him to go to the <placeName>Province </placeName>for the <date n="Summer-1822">summer</date>&#8212; He will live with my
<persName>Brother </persName>or yourself&#8212;Your attention to him will oblige me&#8212;He will
be without means&#8212;Occupation will be desirable</p>
