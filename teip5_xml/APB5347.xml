<p><placeName>Lexington</placeName>, <date when="1836-01-14">Jany 14, 1837</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Cousin</persName></p>

<p>I have been again to <placeName>Frankfort </placeName>to get the <placeName>Texas </placeName>resolutions through the
<persName>Senate</persName>. I wrote you of their passage in the <persName>House</persName>. After the recess for
the Christmas Holidays, the weather being excessively cold I could not
immediately get back, and when I arrived had the mortification to learn<pb n="481"/>
they had been brought up, before all the <persName>members </persName>returned, and had been
<hi rend="italic">laid on the table till <date n="06-xx-1836">June</date>.</hi> Could I have got home the same night I should
have done so without showing myself. I had to stay, however, and learned,
from conversation with my <persName>friends </persName>among the <persName>senators</persName>, that probably a
vote of reconsideration might be obtained. On motion it proved to be the
fact; and after a very animated and interesting discussion, for which I 
furnished the chief matter, such ignorance prevails on the subject, the 
Resolutions were carried, but with very considerable amendments, growing out
of <hi rend="italic">prudential </hi>motives. Old men are excessively prudent, as if there could
be danger in requesting <persName>congress </persName>to recognize when they see reason for so
doing. The amendments are rather in the phraseology than in the sense.
<persName>Mr Wiggington</persName> seemed displeased and doubted if the <persName>House </persName>would concur.
I shall have to go again to see about it. The success of these Resolutions&#8212;
They are called my resolutions&#8212;is ascribed entirely to the presence of the
<persName>ladies</persName>. The seats were crowded by my influence and example. The <persName>ladies</persName>
call out the eloquence&#8212;and they electioneer well in the <placeName>lobbies </placeName>and in
<placeName>society</placeName>. Our friends in the senate are Mesrs <persName>Carter</persName>&#8212;<persName>Willes</persName>&#8212;Dixon&#8212;
<persName>Barnet</persName>&#8212;<persName>Young</persName>. All were eloquent. <persName>Willes </persName>most elaborate. I gave him
a book&#8212;and numbers of the <placeName>Telegraph</placeName>. <persName>Fergurson </persName>drew up his brief, and
assisted him by hints as he spoke. He was very useful and devoted. They
doubted the ability of <placeName>Texas </placeName>to <hi rend="italic">maintain her Independence</hi>, which was a
clause left out by the amendments. With the alterations they had every
vote but two. One of the <hi rend="italic">no </hi>was the <persName>Uncle of young Woolley</persName> who 
returned with <persName>Wilson </persName>and <persName>Postletwhaite</persName>. Those bad men did incalculable
mischief. Nothing can do away [with] the impression The <persName>President</persName>'s
<placeName>Texas </placeName>message, arriving while the Resolutions were pending, had its effect
to retard. 'He knows better than we,' they would say. <persName>Wharton</persName>s foolish
speech did mischief by giving plausibility to the argument of our 
<persName>opponents </persName>that the <persName>Texian </persName>battles were fought by <persName>adventurers </persName>from the <placeName>United
States</placeName> rather than by <placeName>Texans</placeName>. <persName>Mr Burrel of the Senate</persName>, arrived direct from
<placeName>Texas </placeName>while the discussion was going on, and had he been more of a man
he might have aided us much by a speech in point, as I urged. He is not
much of a talker, and I suspect, though I could not find out, that he was
not altogether pleased. He spoke of the excitement caused by <persName>Santa Anna</persName>'s
release, and of <persName>Houston</persName>'s intemperance and unpopularity. He said he had
been with you some days. He only voted with us&#8212;said nothing. I saw in
<placeName>Frankfort </placeName>an old friend of yours&#8212;<persName>Mrs Ramsey</persName>. She told me to speak to
you of <persName><hi rend="italic">Martha Lockwood</hi>&#8212;of <placeName>St. Louis</placeName></persName>. She said she had led many a
dance with you. I replied, no doubt she would again, for she is going to
<placeName>Texas </placeName>to reside, being a <hi rend="italic"><persName>widow</persName></hi>, and having a <persName>sister </persName>there, living in <placeName>Nacog-<pb n="482"/>
doches</placeName>. We were attracted to each other simply by <placeName>Texas </placeName>sympathy&#8212;
sitting together during the debates.</p>

<p>I wish I could go on to <placeName>Washington</placeName>, now I see how much I could do.
If the money comes soon enough I shall do so. All care will be necessary
<placeName>Texas </placeName>has <persName>enemies</persName>. Unless the mission of <persName>Santa Anna</persName> should effect all.
He is nearly there by this time. He was sick here a week, as you were&#8212;
through severe cold. As soon as able he took carriages from <placeName>Wheeling</placeName>,
the river being frozen&#8212;to be there in ten days. It is now the tenth. Then
he would take stage. He has been heard from at <placeName>Chilacothe</placeName>&#8212;doing well.
<persName>Gen. Jackson</persName> is reported doing well also&#8212;they will therefore meet before
many days. While here he was not very accessible to <persName>visitors</persName>&#8212; I saw
and conversed with him in his room&#8212;found in him all the urbanity of the
perfect gentleman. Could not discover in him the <hi rend="italic">cloven foot</hi>&#8212;or talk of
monster any more. He spoke of you as his <hi rend="italic">amigo</hi>. Complimented us a
good deal&#8212;said he had seen my book etc: said <persName>Henrietta </persName>did not much
resemble the <persName>ladies </persName>he saw in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; I replied he could not have seen
many there&#8212;they had to <hi rend="italic">fly before</hi> him etc: He laughed at all I said was
very pleasant, as was <persName>Almonte</persName>. They promised to pass an even'g at my
<placeName>house </placeName>with some <persName>Kentucky ladies</persName>. They did not however give me a chance.
They produced quite a sensation. Our lamented friend <persName>Charlton Hunt</persName> was
buried with military honors the day they arrived, which caused a concourse
in the streets. He was frightened at the sight of Military supposing him-
[self] the object of attention. Reports of him have gone ahead of him
all the way&#8212;and people, tired of the cry of wolf, suffered him to pass
unmolested. God speed him and <placeName>Texas</placeName>.&#8212; I wrote you about <persName>Fergurson</persName>.
You did not get the letters in season&#8212; <persName>Wharton </persName>passed while he was
busy at <placeName>Frankfort</placeName>. He will probably return to <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Ever yours</p>

<p><persName>M A H</persName>.</p>

<p>Since writing&#8212;I have a letter from <persName>Henry</persName>, <date when="1836-12-09">9 Dec</date>: Some hope of the
money glad affairs go on so well. <persName>Henrietta </persName>and I will go to <persName>Washington</persName>
rather than <placeName>N Orleans</placeName>. <persName>Emily </persName>has returned from <placeName>N York</placeName>&#8212; We are all
very well. Have an approv'g letter from <persName>Edwards teacher</persName>&#8212; Best love to
cousin <persName>Emily</persName>. <persName>Girls </persName>send theirs also to her and you&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>S F Austin Texas</persName>.</p>

<p>Care of <persName>Messrs Toby and Brothers</persName> <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></p>
