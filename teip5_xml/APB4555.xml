<p><date when="1833-04-19">April 19. 1833</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother </persName>and <persName>Sister</persName>,</p>

<p>I send you <persName>Simon </persName>and wish you to keep him at work on the <placeName>farm</placeName>
untill I return He is a good <persName>field hand </persName>and will help out very much
with the crop.</p>

<p>I have some steers and work oxen on <placeName>peach creek</placeName>. They run at
or <placeName>near <persName>Isham Phillips</persName></placeName>. <persName>Mr. Mathis</persName> wants to buy one of the work
oxen. Also <placeName>near <persName>Slaughter</persName>s on the Bernard</placeName> there are some, and
some at <placeName><persName>Rabb</persName>s place</placeName>. They are all of the <persName>Rabb </persName>stock and I believe
are branded with my brand. Send and get them or sell them. They
will do for beef. There are some cows among them. Your mule is
<placeName>in the prairie below here</placeName> with <persName>Urbain</persName>'s horses and I have a mule
in my brand <placeName>on the same range</placeName>. I sold the horses I had at <placeName><persName>Coles</persName></placeName>
to <persName>S. P. Brown</persName>. There is a number of head of cattle in the <placeName>prairie</placeName>
that <persName>Hunter </persName>collected for me. <persName>Fletcher </persName>has the list of them $122.
worth&#8212;all these scattered cattle ought to be got together and taken
to <placeName>peach point</placeName> or they will be lost. There is 100 head or more. Have
them collected and take them below or sell them. I think you
could get <persName>James Baird</persName> to collect them.</p>

<p>I leave my business with <persName>Williams </persName>and have authorized <persName>John
Austin</persName> to sell the <placeName>lots in Brasoria</placeName> and a <placeName>labor at the mouth of the
river</placeName> etc. I have <placeName>three eleven league grants</placeName> in the name of <persName>Aguirre
and Vega</persName> that I bought last year. They are in <persName>Williams </persName>hands.
Also <persName>Juan Antonio Padilla</persName> contracted three leagues of his <placeName>grant </placeName>to
me in payment of about $2000 that I let him have <date n="xx-xx-1830">three years ago</date>.</p>

<p><persName>John P. Coles</persName> is to make me a title for <placeName>three leagues and a half
of his tract fronting on the Brassos</placeName>. It is first rate bottom land
<placeName>just above the Yeagua</placeName>.</p>

<p>I have paid off<persName> Anthony Butler </persName>in full and got <persName>James Whitesides
</persName>receipt against the two notes of mine that <persName>Butler </persName>has&#8212;the other notes<pb n="952"/>
I took up. I have also paid off <persName>George Tennelle</persName> in full and <persName>Hunter</persName>
and leave no debts that are pressing, nor any, of any amount due
to any one. One of the <persName>Tennel </persName>notes is yet out in the<placeName> U. S.</placeName> he
passed it away before he came here. I also Owe $400 to <persName>Lovelace </persName>in
<placeName>Ouchita </placeName>that I borrowed in <date n="xx-xx-1821">1821</date>. There is a debt of about $400 due
by my <persName>brothers estate</persName> to the <persName>Estate of Luciano Garcia in <placeName>Tamaulipas
</placeName></persName>for a cavallarda of mares&#8212;I am bound for this debt. I think
that $4000 will now square me with the world including interest.</p>

<p>This trip to <placeName>mexico</placeName> interferes very much with me&#8212;in two months
more I could have closed all my business and gone to work below
improving a <placeName>farm </placeName>and I intended to do so, and have settled myself
along side of you permanently&#8212;I shall now spend the whole 
<date n="Summer-1833">summer </date>away at least. It is a great sacrifice indeed. I also expect
that this trip will cost me about $2000 or 8000 at least which of
course will never be refunded. But if I can succeed in getting a
State Govt and the <date when="1830-04-06">6 of April</date> law repealed I shall be well paid and
perfectly satisfied. If I fail I shall loose my time and money and
risk my health and life, and get repaid (very likely) in abuse and
illiberal reflections. This however is all quite natural&#8212;so it is with
all who serve the <persName>Sovereign people</persName>, they are the hardest masters
on earth.</p>

<p>Should <persName>troops </persName>be stationed <placeName>at the mouth of the river</placeName> it will make
money plenty and a sale for provisions which will benefit the 
<placeName>country</placeName>&#8212;tho I hope but few will be sent for I fear they can not 
harmonise with the people. I shall try and keep them away if I can.
The <persName>officers </persName>are generally very polite and gentlemenly men and if
they spoke English there would be no difficulty with them.</p>

<p>I enter upon this mission with great anxiety for I am convinced
the welfare of <placeName>Texas </placeName> depends on success. We cannot do without a
<persName>State govt</persName>, any longer. It is impossible, the events of <date n="xx-xx-1832">last year</date>
have so completely disjointed matters that nothing but a <persName>State gov</persName>.
will set them right again&#8212;and a <placeName>state </placeName>we must have. If every
thing had remained quiet untill now our chance of success would have
been better, but as the current is in motion it must flow on, and if
we cannot get a <placeName>state </placeName>by peaceable means, I shall <hi rend="italic">then </hi>unite with the
<hi rend="italic">hottest </hi>to get one by other means. If we are to have war, we must
all go together, there must be no divisions amongst us, but I hope
that calamity will never fall upon <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Tell <persName>McNiel </persName>and <persName>Westail</persName>
that when I return with the state approved they must give a <hi rend="italic">State
frolic</hi>. The <persName>girls </persName>must not get married untill then. My love to
them and to you all.    Farewell.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
