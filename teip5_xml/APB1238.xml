</add></p>

<p>I inclose to your <persName>Lordship </persName>the original and translation of an 
application of <persName>Burrel J. Thompson</persName> of the <placeName>District of Nacogdoches</placeName>, for
authority to raise a <persName>company of mounted volunteers </persName>to assist in 
defending this <placeName>frontier</placeName>, and two other papers on the same subject, which
he sent to me to be translated. These <persName>volunteers </persName>have offered me their
services, through <persName>Thompson</persName>, to fight our <persName>Indian enemies</persName>. I have 
informed them that I was not authorized to accept their offer, unless it
is made through the <persName>Alcalde </persName>of their <placeName>District</placeName>, or with your <persName>Lordship's</persName>
previous sanction.<pb n="1404"/></p>

<p>I am fully aware that there are many cavilling <persName>men</persName>, disposed to
complain of the <persName>authorities </persName>without cause, and, even, to interfere with
them. As I am not acquainted with all the reasons that induced the
<persName>Alcalde </persName>to prohibit the organization of that <persName>company</persName>, I cannot give
a decisive opinion on the subject; but from what I could learn of the
character and intentions of these <persName>men</persName>, I see no impropriety in 
allowing them to form a <persName>company</persName>, and I have no doubt that it would be
advisable to accept their services to fill the place of the sixty <persName>men</persName>
whom the <persName>Alcalde </persName>has [been] ordered to furnish me with in an 
emergency. But your <persName>Lordship </persName>will be better able to judge. I have 
submitted this subject to your <persName>Lordship </persName>at the request of the <persName>parties</persName>
interested, on account of their ignorance of the Spanish language,
and not with an intention to interfere with the business of the 
<placeName>District of Nacogdoches</placeName>.</p>

<p>I have also received from the <persName>people of the <placeName>Trinity</placeName></persName> a verbal tender
of their services against the <persName>Indians </persName>should they be required; I 
answered them that I had no authority to accept them without your
<persName>Lordship</persName>'s consent.</p>

<p>There is no doubt when the cold season sets in that the <persName>Indians </persName>will
attack us, and I consider it important to be ready for them in time.</p>

<p>God and Liberty.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName>.
