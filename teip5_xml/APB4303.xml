<p>[December 29, 1831?]</p>
<p>It is not difficult for the immagination to determine what must be
the future destiny of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Should the <persName>Mexican Government</persName> adopt
a correct policy as to this <placeName>country</placeName>, it will form <placeName>one of the most
powerful states of their confederation</placeName>, for under a judicious system
it would not be [to] the interests of <placeName>Texas </placeName>to separate.   But should<pb n="731"/>
the reverse of this, unfortunately be the ease, a speedy and total
separation will naturally follow as a matter of course, and an 
independent government will probably be the result. The permanent and
substantial interests of both <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and the <placeName>U. S. of the North</placeName>,
would be promoted in very many respects by the establishment of
an<placeName> independent republic in the middle ground</placeName>. Such a <placeName>new nation</placeName>
would remove the line of immediate contact which now exist 
<placeName>between the two great republics</placeName>, and do away with those innumerable
small incidents and vexatious causes of complaint and excitement
which always will arise <placeName>on the border limits of large nations </placeName>remote
from the <placeName>seat of Govt</placeName>. Too feeble to be feared by either of its
<persName>neighbors</persName>, it would opperate as a kind of sacred and necessary barrier
against the encroachments of either. <placeName>Texas </placeName>would form a <placeName>compact
nation,</placeName> and under the patronage and protection of both the <placeName>U. S.
</placeName>and of <placeName>M.</placeName> could sustain a respectable standing unless it should
enfeeble itself by the system of <persName>negro </persName>slavery. By the existing 
constitution and laws this worst of evils is totally prohibited. Should
this wise policy be abandoned and <placeName>Texas </placeName>become what <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>is
the receptacle of the redundant and <placeName>Jail </placeName>delivered <persName>Slaves </persName>of other
<placeName>countries</placeName>, it must from necessity have a prop to lean upon and
become dependent, as a<placeName> <persName>slave </persName>state</placeName> it probably could not stand alone.
The annexation of such an extencive <placeName>country </placeName>to the <placeName>U. S</placeName>. would be
a measure of such doubtful policy, that it would no doubt be opposed
by reflecting men from all the <placeName>states </placeName>and especially by the <placeName>eastern
and Atlantic </placeName>ones on the ground that it would endanger the <placeName>union</placeName>
by too great an extension of <placeName>Territory to the Southwest.</placeName></p>
