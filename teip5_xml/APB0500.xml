<p><placeName>St Antonio</placeName> <date when="1822-04-16">16th April 1822</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I left home and arrived at this place <date when="1822-06-15">yesterday </date>I left <placeName>Home </placeName>the
<date when="1822-01-22">22nd January </date>and have had a Tedious Journey as you will see by the
date I was mortified to hear of your vessell not having arrived on
the <placeName>Brassos </placeName>I saw Messrs <persName>Foster </persName>and <persName>Burnet </persName>who stated that your
articles were Landed at the <placeName>mouth of that River</placeName> <persName>Foster </persName>was then on
his way to the <placeName>place of Landing</placeName> and stated that he would Remain
by the goods Report says that yours and two other vessels had fitted
out for the same <placeName>coast </placeName>that is yours a second time I felt considerably
Shagrined when I heard that you had gone to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>but it was no
doubt Necessary&#8212;I am pleased with the country on <placeName>Brassos </placeName><placeName>Colorado</placeName>
and <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName>but particularly the Former I am sorry I cannot
see you as I can do nothing the <persName>Governor </persName>Refers me to you and
I am in doubt how to act more especially as the <persName>Government </persName>is not
compleately Organized consequently I know not what the 
constitution will be or whether the settlement will be circumscribed to a
particular number or not nor what the Result of those other Restric-<pb n="497"/>
tions will be all of which seams to defeat my expectations could
I do anything profitable I would stay untill I knew the Result but I
fear I shall be forced to Return home and there it may end as Relates
to myself and I fear it may prevent others as numbers of Respectable
<persName>citizens from <placeName>Washington</placeName></persName> would have moved to the country had or
could I give them encouragement should I not stay I wish to hear
from you particularly on the subject on your Return your Relatives
were well as were my own family when I left <placeName>Missouri </placeName>I recd both your
letters of <date when="1821-11-15">Novr 15th </date>from <placeName>Orleans </placeName>with the Receipts and money by
<persName>Mr Honey</persName> which was a Timely Relief&#8212;I am without money and
your <persName>Brother </persName>has let me have his watch to Take me home the price
we will settle when we meat if ever&#8212;Colletts exn [execution] amts
to 229$ and whatever cost and interest may be on it hereafter -I have
paid <persName>Guyard </persName>290 dollars including the money you sent me 200$ which
is the whole amount I showed your <persName>Brother </persName>the papers he can Give
you all the information you may want on the subject as soon as you
can please give me Relief</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>

<p><persName>R C Bruffy</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Stephen. F. Austin Esqr</persName> care of <persName>Mr J. E. B. Austin</persName></p>
