<p><placeName>Gonzales </placeName><date when="1831-08-05">5 August 1831</date></p>
<p>Respected Sir</p>

<p>A short respite from almost incessant writing enables me by this
opportunity to make my acknowledgments for the Kindness 
(unmerited altogether) with which you have favor'd an individual 
personally a <persName>stranger </persName>to you; the value of which is doubly enhanced<pb n="687"/>
by the testimony it affords of the disposition of the <persName>Govt </persName>to reward
in a reasonable way the services however humble of those who have
been instrumental in defence of the <placeName>Country</placeName>, and the source by
which it has been received, as without your interference, it would
in all human probability have continued for me a dead letter&#8212;</p>

<p>On reverting to Art's 10, 22 and 27 of Law <date when="1828-03-24">24 Mar</date>: it appears
that this species of <placeName>grant </placeName>is exempted from paymt of any dues to
the <placeName>State</placeName>, this has not been attended to in my case, tho' <persName>officers
in the Navy</persName> from a Mid' in the line of promotion are " <persName>Militares </persName>"
and I would feel oblig'd for your opinion whether it is worth
troubling the <persName>Govr </persName>with a representation or whether a saving clause
could not be inserted in the deed to provide, against the payment,
I am undecided where to locate this <placeName>League</placeName>, I am poor and unable
to improve it when located, and would if a fair offer could be had
sell it,   what is your opinion ?</p>

<p>We get on slowly making out the deeds, the <persName>people </persName>are fractious
and unprovided, the <persName>Commissioners </persName>fees are high, the <persName>Surveyors </persName>not
being able to get half their pay are hostile and untractable, much
praise is due to<persName> Mr. Byrd Lockhart </persName>for his forbearance and exertions
in the dispatch of business, and without him every thing would have
been por la obra de <persName>Dios</persName>. <persName>Col: De W.</persName> is well and will save his
premium. I have heard that two of <persName>Martin de L's Sons </persName>are in
durance on the <placeName>Rio Grande </placeName>taken in their laudable exertions for
the extention of the Tobacco business, one of them is <persName>Dn, Fernando
Commissr elect</persName> for his <placeName>father's Colony</placeName>. Compliments and best
wishes for your welfare and happiness from <persName>Mr. Navarro</persName>, the 
<persName>DeWitt</persName>s <persName>Lockhart </persName>and those of your much oblig'd and obedt.</p>

<p><persName>Josh. R. Bedford</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>To <persName>S. F. Austin Esqre</persName></p>

<p>N. B.   I enclose you a dollar and a half which makes us quits.&#8212;</p>

<p>P. S. <persName>Mr. N.</persName> thinks that the Communication in No, 18&#8212; of
<date when="1831-06-27">27 June last</date> as coming from him and affecting indirectly the honor
of his friend <persName>Musquiz </persName>might have been better edited, the word
"declamation" is inserted for <hi rend="italic">"acclamation"</hi> and he is made to
sign himself Señor which appears to have been done thro' irrasion,
this is the liberty of the press with a vengeance.</p>

<p><persName>J. R. B.</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:] To<persName> Col: Stephen F. Austin</persName>   <placeName>Austin</placeName></p>
