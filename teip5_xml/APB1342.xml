<p><placeName>Nashville </placeName><date when="1827-03-08">8th March 1827</date></p>
<p><persName>Colo. Austin</persName>,</p>

<p>Dear Sir, <persName>Majr. League</persName> the <persName>bearer </persName>of this has been appointed
by the <persName>Texas association</persName> of this <placeName>place </placeName>their <persName>agent </persName>to go to <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>
and apply to the convention now in session there in their behalf.
To comply with the letter of the collonization law in the settling
of their <placeName>Colony </placeName>presents so many and serious difficulties to the view
of the <persName>Company</persName>, that they have become very much disheartend, and
will I believe cause them to entirely abandon the enterprise, unless
they can obtain some modification of the <placeName>grant </placeName>more favorable to
its settlement. In their opinion the <persName>government </persName>can make terms
much more favorable to the <persName>company</persName>, and in the end eventuate
to the interest of the Government. This <persName>company </persName>wish particularly
to have the power of selecting their <persName>settlers</persName>, who are to be their
<persName>neighbours</persName>. This seems to be a "sine qua non" to any further
attempt to make <placeName>settlements </placeName>in the <placeName>Country</placeName>. If they do settle in the
<placeName>Country </placeName>they wish their lives and property to be as safe as their
prudence can make them, and they think this can only be effected
by the power being vested in themselves to keep out of their 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>any persons they may have the least suspicion of being 
restless, discontented, revolutionizing and disorganizing persons&#8212;<persName>Majr
League</persName> will communicate freely with you touching the matter for
which he goes on to the <placeName>seat of government</placeName>, and so far as you may
think them proper and obtainable, your cooperation with him to
effect the wishes of this <persName>company </persName>will be gratefully acknowledged
by them. It is my present opinion that should<persName> Majr. League</persName> 
succeed in obtaining some of the vital changes desired, and your 
<placeName>country </placeName>remain quiet through the <date n="Summer - 1827">summer </date>infinately a greater tide [of]
emigration will set into it <date n="Fall - 1827">next fall</date> than has ever yet been 
experienced. I think at present it would greatly benefit your <placeName>country</placeName>
for it to be generally understood, (and be lawful) that <persName>foreigners</persName>
could hold <placeName>landed estates</placeName> in it. My present limits will not allow
me to go into the reasons for this opinion, but I have no doubt of its
correstness&#8212;present me in the most friendly terms to our friend
<persName>Ingram</persName>,   accept assurances of my highest regard</p>

<p><persName>Felix Robertson</persName></p>
