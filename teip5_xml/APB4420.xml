<p>Sir</p>

<p>In addition to our representation under <date when="1832-08-24">yesterdays date</date> handed to
you here with, we have further to lay before you the following
facts,&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Military commandant of <placeName>this post</placeName></persName> continues obstinately to
oppose the Plan of <persName>Genl. Sta Anna</persName>, after the receipt of the 
pronouncement of your <persName>Ayuntamiento </persName>(by the <persName>Authorities </persName>here) he
was called upon by them to attend a meeting of their <persName>Corporate body</persName>
to deliberate upon the reply to be made, he refused, alledging that
himself and his <persName>officers </persName>would continue to adhere to the actual Govmt.
of <persName>Sr Bustamte</persName> untill compelled by force of arms to act otherwise.&#8212;</p>

<p>After closing <date when="1832-08-23">last evening</date> our respects before alluded to, the mail
arrived from your <placeName>quarter</placeName>&#8212; it brought dispatches to the 
<persName>Commandant </persName>and this morning he waited upon the <persName>Alcalde</persName>, shewing him
a confidential letter he had received, stating that <persName>Mr. Bowie</persName> was
now on his march to <placeName>Bejar</placeName>, with <persName>troops</persName>,&#8212;that a force had been
prepared with you to come to <placeName>this place</placeName>, but that it had not come
hither in consequence of your having been informed that this place
had already pronounced in favor of the Constitution and Laws&#8212;He
demanded of the <persName>Alcalde </persName>his aid, of the <persName>Civicos </persName>etc. in case this
<persName>force </persName>should come, the <persName>Alcalde </persName>told him not to expect from him
any aid whatever, that neither he nor the <persName>Citizens </persName>would oppose the
forces of <persName>Santa Anna</persName>, and that should they come, he might get within
his own walls and make what defense he could with his <persName>troops</persName>&#8212;he
then said he would communicate with him on the Subject and make
his demand officially&#8212;to which the <persName>Alcalde </persName>replied, that he should
make him the same answer in writing, that he then did verbally&#8212;
finally the <persName>Commdt</persName>. manifested, that should he find no assistance
here, he would proceed with his <persName>troops </persName>to <placeName>Bejar</placeName>, and join those of
his own <persName>party </persName>there,&#8212;these are the last occurences transpired here
up to this hour   4 P. M.&#8212;</p>
