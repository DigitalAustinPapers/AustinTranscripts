<p><placeName>Head Quarters Camp Sivolo</placeName></p>
<p><date when="1835-10-23">October 23, 1835</date></p>

<p>The <persName>Commander in chief</persName> announces to the <persName>Army </persName>information of the most
encouraging nature from the <placeName>Interior</placeName>&#8212;that the Cause of the Constitution
and the Federal System is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, gaining new strength, daily&#8212;that, <persName>Genl.
Alvarez </persName>a warm <persName>Federalist </persName>has lately gained two important Victories
over the <persName>troops of the Dictator&#8212;Santa Anna</persName> and has been joined by two
other <persName>Generals </persName>of distinction, <persName>Montenegro </persName>and <persName>Grozman</persName>&#8212;that the <persName>troops at
<placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and <placeName>San Louis</placeName></persName> which had been destined and were actually on the
march for <placeName>Texas</placeName>, had been ordered back on account of troubles behind
them&#8212;</p>

<p>He further anounces that <persName>D. Juan Seguin</persName>&#8212;the <persName>Mexican </persName>who Came to
<placeName>Camp </placeName>last night with his <persName>followers </persName>and left <date when="1835-10-23">this morning </date>has given the
most flattering account of the good disposition of the <persName>Citizens </persName>generally in
<placeName>Bejar </placeName>and its <placeName>neighborhood</placeName>&#8212;their friendship to the Cause we are 
defending and willingness to serve us.&#8212;He has appointed <persName>Mr. Seguin</persName> a <persName>Captn.
in the Army</persName>, Vesting him with authority to raise a <persName>Company of Mexican
Volunteers</persName> to Cooperate with us.&#8212;They will be of essential service in
many respects&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Commander in chief</persName> deems it his duty to an ounce also, a Vague
rumor he has received that <persName>troops </persName>to the number of 300 were on the march
from <placeName>Matamoras </placeName>and other parts, destined for the <persName>garrison at the <placeName>Nueces
</placeName></persName> and the recapture of <placeName>Labahia</placeName>&#8212;but this rumor is by no means to be 
credited, as there is no sufficient authority to support it&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>troops from the <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>Department</persName> are Confidently expected
to join us, within a very few days&#8212;</p>

<p>As soon as they arrive, the force here will be deemed Competent for
further and more important operations&#8212;</p>

<p>At all events, the time can not be long before the Valour and patriotism
of the <persName>Freemen of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> will have an opportunity to display themselves
upon the head of <persName>military despots</persName> and the <persName>enemies of Freedom</persName>.&#8212; In the
mean time the <persName>Commander in chief</persName> exhorts his <persName>countrymen </persName>to be patient
and firm in the discharge of their duty; enduring as <persName>Freemen </persName>have always
been known to do, every privation for the sake of the sacred Cause they are
defending&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
<p>By order<persName> Warren D. C Hall Adjt Insptr Genl</persName></p>
<p>[Endorsed]: Address to the <placeName>Army Camp Cibolo</placeName></p>
