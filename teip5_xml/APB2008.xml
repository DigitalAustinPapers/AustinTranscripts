<p>We whose names are subscribed in the third Colum of this book
acknowledge that on the days set down in the second Column 
opposite to our respective names We received from the <persName>Emp° Stephen F.
Austin</persName> a permission to select land in his <placeName>Colony </placeName>as <persName>settlers </persName>in the
same by which it appears that as <persName>married men</persName> the Law allows one
sitio and one Labor of Land and therefore in Compliance with the
foregoing regulations which have been heretofore published and
understood by us we do each of us separately hereby covenant and
agree with said <persName>Austin </persName>to pay him Fifty dollars each in two 
payments that is to say 20$ in 6 months from the date of the said 
permision as set down in the 2d Column opposite to our respective
names and thirty dollars in one year from the sd. date, for the true
and faithful payment of which sum as above specified by each one
seperately without any defalcation delay or objection whatever to
said <persName>Austin </persName>or order we do each of us seperately bind ourselves our
heirs or assigns, and as security for said payment we do each of us
seperately hereby mortgage to said <persName>Austin </persName>or to his assigns the Land
which we may each individually receive as <persName>settlers </persName>in sd <placeName>Colony</placeName>, In
faith of which we sign this agreement and obligation in presence
of the witness whose name is signed in the first column opposite
our respective names, and hereby make it binding on us and our
heirs it being a fair contract explained and understood by each one
of us fully before signing and as such guaranteed to the sd. <persName>Emp°
</persName>by the 9th article of the colonization Law of this <placeName>state</placeName>.</p>
