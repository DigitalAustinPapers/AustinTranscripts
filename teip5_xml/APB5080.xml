<p>Dr. Sir</p>

<p>Your horse is sent up by <persName>Simon</persName>. I am unable to say any thing about the
Schooner W. Robbins as to her sailing I would be very glad to see you for
a day or two before you leave. It is now thought the W Robbins should
go to <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>Perhaps we will be able to arrange otherwise. I fear if a
stand is not taken against self dubed <persName>patriots </persName>all our labors in <placeName>Texas </placeName>are
gone to the devil and me with it. Where is the money to come from to pay
10 or 15 Million of Dollars with our present population We must decline
in credit and means will be with held from us and we must fail altogether
all for being a little fearful of oposing Red hot unthinking <persName>politicians</persName>
whose business will be to spend money but upon the <persName>people </persName>will devolve
the burthen of paying it and when the devil will we be able to pay 3 or 400$
for <persName>every soul in <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> all for high sounding terms&#8212;Finding several pieces
written and published in favr. of Independence by the Same men over 
different signatures and finding none of our <persName>Citizens </persName>oposing&#8212;I wrote and
sent to that <persName>Slave Gray</persName> a piece in order to let it be known that we were not
unanimous in that way of thinking and to get our <persName>citizens </persName>to reflect. He
seemed to approve it and said he would publish it but the next day <persName>John
Wharton</persName> reached there and he has suppressed the publication and 
substituted a bag of stuff illy comporting with our present condition. I am truly
surprised that public opinion should be thus forstalled and our <persName>politicians</persName>
yielding the very right of thought to a wild unthinking faction. Can or
will you do it God forbid you have the power of saving <placeName>Texas </placeName>if you will
exert it but what is to be come of us Come down.</p>

<p>Your friend</p>

<p><persName>Thomas F. McKinney </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>[Note on back:] Since writing news has reached us that <persName>Cos </persName>has fled
with <persName>100 men</persName> from <placeName>Bexar </placeName><persName>Milam </persName>killed a vessel is off filled from one
end to the other with <persName>passengers </persName>we know what [not] what she is but
think it the Santiago	<persName>McK</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col Stephen F. Auston </persName><placeName>Peach Point</placeName></p>
