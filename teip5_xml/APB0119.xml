<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Have you lost confidence in all your <persName>Friends </persName>? You appear 
determined not to correspond with any don't suffer yourselves to go into
the other extreem, and distrust every one&#8212;I know, by experience,
the great bulk of them, who make the warmest Professions, are
totally destitute of sincerity, espetially if a Person happens to be
unfortunate but still, there are some few, who merit confidence.&#8212;</p>

<p>I should like to hear from you, I feel an interest in your welfare
you may depend&#8212;I should like to know how you come on, when you
calculate to go to <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>etc&#8212;From report it appears, <persName>Young
Hammond</persName>, is in troubled water at the <placeName>Mines</placeName>, I hope he will have
Prudence and resolution to extricate himself with honor.&#8212; If the
reign of Terror at the <placeName>Mines </placeName>is to last, nothing would enduce me
to live there, I am sure nothing like enjoyment is to be found
there.&#8212;<pb n="132"/></p>

<p>I am told, <persName>Mr. Bibb, from <placeName>Kentucky</placeName></persName>, who left here this morning
for the <placeName>Mines</placeName>, has gotten a very good Gigg for sale and had you
not better purchase it of him? You will find it very convenient
in this <placeName>Country</placeName>. I think you had best get away your Corn from
this <placeName>Village</placeName>. It is not gaining in Quantity you may depend&#8212; Had
you not better get some of your Hollow Ware out also? You are
losing the Sale of it, appears to me&#8212;The 25 bars of Lead, I had
deliver'd directly to <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName>, to whom it was to go, he gave the
<persName>Teamster </persName>a Receipt for it&#8212;I have heard nothing from home, this
four weeks&#8212; What can be the reason I am at a loss to determine&#8212;
I shall make arrangement to get my <persName>Family </persName>and <persName>Horace Austin</persName> and
his <persName>Family </persName>to <placeName>Pittsburgh </placeName>there I calculate, you will meet the whole
<persName>party </persName>and accompany them <placeName>down the River</placeName>&#8212;Give my love to the
<persName>Family</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>T. Phelps</persName></p>

<p>N. B. The <persName>Sqaws </persName>have done your skins, shall I sell them and at
how much?</p>
