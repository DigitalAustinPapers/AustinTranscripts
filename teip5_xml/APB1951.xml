<p><placeName>Matamoros </placeName><date when="1830-06-03">June 3d 1830</date></p>
<p><persName>Col. S F Austin</persName></p>

<p>My dear Sir In a letter which I wrote you by <persName>Captn John
Austin</persName> I expressed a wish that you might be induced to accept
<persName>Genl Teran</persName>s invitation to meet him here rather than at <placeName>La bahia
</placeName>or <placeName>St Antonio</placeName>&#8212; Since writing circumstances have transpired
which cause me to suspect the <persName>Genl</persName>s Views to be somewhat
treacherous</p>

<p>When he came here one of his <persName>aids </persName>told <persName>Col Bradburn</persName> who was
then with me that one of the<persName> Genl</persName>s objects in visiting <placeName>Texas </placeName>was
to remove you from the <placeName>Colony</placeName>, your influence with the <persName>colonists</persName>
being dangerous to the security of the province&#8212;</p>

<p>I paid but little attention to the observation at the time 
supposing it to be impossible for the <persName>Genl</persName> to meditate so rash a
measure&#8212;</p>

<p>Today there is great excitement amongst the <persName>Americans</persName>, on acct
of a declaration <date when="1830-06-02">last night</date> by the <persName>Genl </persName>to a <persName>Mexican </persName>in presence
of an <persName>American </persName>whom he supposed not to understand <persName>Spanish</persName>,
that he viewed the <persName>foreigners </persName><placeName>in this part of the country </placeName>as the
Most dangerous <persName>enemies </persName>of it particularly the <persName>North Americans</persName>
whose sole object was to wrest from the <persName>Mexicans </persName><placeName>their property</placeName>
and so much of their <placeName>territory </placeName>as they could get&#8212; The <persName>American</persName>
could not refrain from asking him if it were possible that such were
his real sentiments to which he replied they were&#8212; You know
the duplicity of the <persName>Mexican </persName>character&#8212;their general want of
faith in all transactions and the necessity of being guarded against
their villany&#8212; It is possible the observation of the<persName> Genls Aid to
Col B </persName>was with good information of the subject. It may therefore
be wise to keep yourself under cover of your own rifles, which
<persName>Genl Teran</persName> has not nerve nor power to encounter you must take
good care not to let it transpire that I communicate with you on this
subject as it would probably consign me to the <placeName>Calabose</placeName></p>

<p>I shall be off as soon as I possibly can but have too much property
outstanding to do it immediately</p>
