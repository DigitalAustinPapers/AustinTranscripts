<p><persName>Mr J F Perry</persName></p>

<p>An attempt has been made here to day to involve us in an immediate
Revolution, by sending <persName>troops </persName>forthwith in obedience to a call by the <persName>chief
of Police</persName> to fight the <persName>federal force</persName> a report and resolution were produced
Cut and dried in Caucus last night, Compromiting us at once&#8212; I moved
as an amendment&#8212; That the further consideration of the subject matter
before the meeting should be postponed until the great body of the <persName>people
of this <placeName>Municipality</placeName></persName> could be convened to express their sentiments as to<pb n="78"/>
the expediency of a measure involving the Security of the rights and
property and the safety and lives of the <persName>families </persName>of the <persName>people </persName>this was
not admitted by the <persName>agitators </persName>as an amendment, when it was determined
to put the Report and Resolutions to Vote first and then take the Vote upon
my motion, on division <persName>2/3</persName> were against their report&#8212; They then without
taking a vote upon my motion, so modified their resolutions as to effect
the same purpose which being agreed to They appointed a <persName>commitee</persName>
to draft a report and resolution to be proposed to the meeting on <date when="1835-06-28">Sunday</date>&#8212;
<persName>Archer </persName><persName>Wharton </persName><persName>Jack </persName>and <persName>Henry Smith.</persName></p>

<p>It was proposed to add me and <persName>R. Williams</persName> I declined to aid in 
forestaling the sentiments of the people. Thinking the meeting on <date when="1835-06-28">Sunday</date>
ought to be left free to appoint their own committee and the people will
reject their report on that ground if it be put to them</p>

<p>You and <persName>Pleasant McNeel</persName> must be here all the <persName>McNeels</persName> <persName>Grey</persName>, <persName>Crosby</persName>&#8212;,
every one who can give a vote, for the cast is to be made which will lose
or win all our hopes in <placeName>Texas </placeName>The court is adjourned until <date when="1835-06-29">Monday </date>I
am still quite unwell with the cold I took below&#8212; 12 oclock is the hour&#8212;
best remembrances to <persName>Emily </persName>cordially and truly your friend</p>
