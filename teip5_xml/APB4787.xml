<p>[From the Williams Papers. Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas.]</p>

<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1835-05-06">6 May 1835</date></p>

<p>My friend,</p>

<p>The Amnesty law was published on the <date when="1835-05-03">3d instant</date>, and I shall be at full
liberty to leave here so soon as the necessary forms are completed to
cancel my bail bonds etc&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>D. Victor Blanco</persName> intends to leave here about the <date when="1835-05-26">26 instant</date> and I shall
wait for him if I do not conclude to go by water, for I am at present 
undetermined, tho think it probable shall go by land in which event expect to
reach <placeName>Monclova</placeName> about the <date when="1835-06-20">20 June</date>&#8212; presume you will have left there
for home long before that time&#8212; It is my wish and intention to take
wing in the <date n="Spring-1835">spring</date>&#8212;by that time I can close all my affairs I hope, and
be able to spend a year or two in a ramble&#8212; I have a constitutional
excuse or rather I am [constitutionally impeded by having a causa
pendiente from holding [the] seat in the <persName>legislature </persName>to which I have been
elected, so that there will be no difficulty on that account</p>

<p>The 400 le[ague] law has totally distroyed the moral standing of that
legislature with <hi rend="italic">all <persName>parties</persName></hi>&#8212;and the <persName>Commandant Genl</persName> has gained credit&#8212;
I recd- your letter of <date when="1835-04-08">8 ult</date> and the letters you enclosed&#8212; <persName>Toney [Anthony
Butler]</persName> left for the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> on the <date when="1835-04-29">29 ult</date>. and <persName>Almonte </persName>on the <date when="1835-04-30">30th</date>&#8212; I have
never in all my life known so bad, and base a man as <persName>Butler</persName>&#8212; At the
time he wrote the O P Q letters he was my <persName>enemy</persName>, and yet he wrote them
as tho they came from a friend of mine, and consequently they were very
well calculated to rouse the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> into rebellion, and also to
throw suspicion on me and perpetuate my imprisonment, and <hi rend="italic">this 
imprisonment</hi> was used by him as a lever to create and keep up excitements in <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
at the head of which he expected to be placed&#8212; He thinks, as it appears,
that the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> can be made tools of to promote the personal
agrandisement of <persName>A. B. [Anthony Butler]</persName>&#8212; he is greatly deceived, or
I do not know the people&#8212;</p>

<p>Everything is quiet here [and] likely to remain so&#8212; That state of
course [will] remain quiet and <placeName>Texas </placeName>in particul[ar]&#8212;it ought to do so&#8212;
Remember me affectionately to <persName>Peebles </persName>and <persName>Johnson</persName>, and also to my old
friend <persName>B. Milam</persName> who I am told by <persName>Offutt </persName>is in <placeName>Monclova</placeName>, also to <persName>Carbajal</persName>
and <persName>Durste </persName>Inform them at home</p>

<p>Yours [Rubric]<pb n="74"/></p>

<p>Remember me particularly to my friend <persName>Ed. Gritten</persName> who I presume is
in <placeName>Mona- [Monclova]</placeName> his <persName>family </persName>are well. I recd- his letters from <placeName>Quero
[Queretaro]</placeName> and <placeName>San Luis</placeName> and thank him also to <persName>Garay </persName>if he is there
as I presume he is</p>

<p>I am happier than I have been for 14 years, for during all that period
my mind has been laboring and worrying for the benefit of <persName>others </persName>and
for the common good. My thoughts are now confined, or I should say are
beginning to confine themselves to a narrower space&#8212;myself, my <persName>family</persName>,
my own individual affairs it is a novelty, a new life to me, for heretofore
I have thought more of other matters than of my own&#8212;but I shall soon
get accustomed to it and be much happier&#8212; I want some money to travel
<date n="xx-xx-1836">next year</date> this at present is all my cuidado</p>
