<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName>, <date when="1831-07-19">July 19,1831</date>.</p>
<p>My Dear <persName>Cousin</persName></p>

<p>I see by your letter to <persName>Henry </persName>that you are looking towards <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
and have even made up your mind for a permanent removal to this
<placeName>Colony</placeName>. It is needless for me to say that I shall be happy to see
you here and anxious to serve you, for I hope you are satisfied of
that fact without any assurance from me. You will think us 
somewhat in the <placeName>wilderness </placeName>perhaps; but our ideas on this as well as
on most matters, are comparative, and dependent on habit and 
disposition. To me, this <placeName>country </placeName>does not <hi rend="italic">now </hi>seem like a <placeName>wilderness</placeName>.
I saw it ten years ago when it was so in fact. Most of the habits
acquired in what is called civilized and refined society, which I once
may have had, have pretty much worn off long since; though I do
not wish you to understand that I have become a bear, or a <persName>Comanche</persName>:
And the strongest proof I can give that I have not is, that the idea
of your removal here, and of the <persName>society </persName>which will of course spring
up under the influence of your wand, gives me more real pleasure
than anything which has occurred for some years.</p>

<p>May we not form a little world of our own where neither the
religious, political, or <hi rend="italic">money-making</hi> fanaticism, which are throwing
the good <persName>people of our native country</persName> into all sorts of convulsions,
shall ever obtain admission? Some <persName>philosopher</persName>, or <persName>dreamer</persName>, has
called man a <hi rend="italic">bundle </hi>of <hi rend="italic">habits</hi>. I think he would call the <persName>North
American </persName>of the present day a <hi rend="italic">bundle of extremes</hi>&#8212;rather loosely
tied together, for they dash round the political, religious, or some
other compass, as it were by fits and starts, without any apparent
reason.</p>

<p>Let us unite a few choice <persName>families </persName>and make a <hi rend="italic"><placeName>neighborhood </placeName></hi>as we
say in this <placeName>country</placeName>. Abundance of such substantial and wholesome
food as sound health and useful exercise require will never be 
wanting. Most of the things called luxuries are inventions or phantasms
of the imagination. We can invent and give reins to the fancy in
this <placeName>country </placeName>as well as any where else; and can supply our own
luxuries in case we cannot get a regular supply of them from <placeName>Paris</placeName>,
<placeName>London</placeName>, or <placeName>New York</placeName>. In short I think we can live happily if we
choose to do so.</p>

<p>The emigration to this <placeName>Colony </placeName>for the last year has been of a very
valuable character, in general, and well calculated to advance the
<placeName>Country</placeName>. I have lately had many assurances of emigration from
<placeName>Virginia </placeName>(my native State) of the first class of people. Many of
the <persName><hi rend="italic">old </hi>families of the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Old Dominion</placeName></hi> </persName>have planted their tobacco
until their <placeName>land </placeName>has become <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, and worn out.   Their <hi rend="italic">old pride</hi> will<pb n="675"/>
never let them down to a moderate style of living so long as they
remain in that <placeName>country </placeName>but here they would take a <hi rend="italic">new </hi>start, and
make first rate <persName>settlers</persName>; for, in general, they are a high-minded,
liberal, and honorable race, too fond of politics to be happy in any
<placeName>country</placeName>, but I hope they will leave their politics behind them, as an
appendage to their worn out land.</p>

<p>From <placeName>New York </placeName>the prospect of emigration is good. <placeName>Texas </placeName>has
made quite a stir in that <placeName>quarter</placeName>&#8212;and though some embarrassments
lie around <persName>The Galveston Bay Company</persName>, owing to their having 
mistaken the law, and started <hi rend="italic">wrong foot ahead,</hi> yet I think with 
prudence the difficulties can be gotten over, in a great measure, and we
shall have a large emigration from the <placeName>Eastern States.</placeName></p>

<p>On[e] of the strongest proofs of the want of a correct idea of
this Colonization business, in most of those who have attempted it,
and failed, or met with embarrassments, is, that they should suspect
me of any unfriendly disposition toward them, or towards their
enterprizes. Nothing can be more unjust, or more at variance with
the plainest dictates of common sense than such a suspicion.</p>

<p>I began here, <date n="xx-xx-1821">ten years since</date>, <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, unaided by influential <persName>men</persName>,
and <hi rend="italic">almost </hi>destitute of capital. With one exception, and of small
amount, I owe no obligations to any one out of this <placeName>country </placeName>for
my success, but I do owe a great and heavy weight of 
responsibility to my <persName>settlers</persName>, and to my adopted Government. Would I
be doing my duty to the former to involve myself and consequently
their interests (for circumstances have made their interests and
my acts, even private ones, in a great degree inseparable) in serious
difficulty by identifying myself with the views of an individual,
or a company, who were in any manner in collision with the
<persName>Mexican Governmen</persName>t? I see by a clause in <persName>Mr Treat</persName>'s letter to
<persName>Henry</persName>, that the <persName>Newyork company </persName>charge me with being unfriendly
to them. They know nothing at all of the business they have
undertaken, and still less of me, and the general principles by
which I am governed, or they would never suspect me, or any
permanent <persName>settlers </persName>of <placeName>Texas </placeName>of a wish to keep back emigration or
the improvement of the <placeName>Country</placeName>.</p>

<p>The difference between <persName>others </persName>who have attempted colonization in
<placeName>Texas </placeName>and myself is this. <hi rend="italic">Their object</hi> has been <hi rend="italic">speculation only.</hi>
<hi rend="italic">My object</hi> has always been, and still is, to settle and improve the
<placeName>country</placeName>, regardless [of] whether I made a fortune or not. 
Judging of my views by their own, and knowing nothing of the 
Colonization Law, nor of the vastly superior advantages of my <placeName>Colony</placeName>
over any other part of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it was very natural in them to 
suppose that <hi rend="italic">competition </hi>would be unpleasant to me. <hi rend="italic">They know me
not.</hi> If to make a fortune had been my object I should have been
enjoying myself in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, or where I pleased, with wealth, and<pb n="676"/>
all that wealth can give, and <placeName>Texas </placeName>would now, and forever be, as
I found it&#8212;a <placeName>wilderness</placeName>, and many of the <persName>capitalists </persName>of <placeName>New York,</placeName>
<placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName>Baltimore </placeName>etc: would have been gulled out of
thousands.</p>

<p>A <persName>moneyed fanatic</persName> would say that I have followed a shadow, for
a fortune I have not made as yet, but I shall have a competence and
am satisfied- The credit of settling this fine <placeName>country </placeName>and <hi rend="italic">laying
the foundation for a <placeName>new Nation</placeName> which at some future period will
arise here can not be taken from me;</hi> and that part of my <persName>family</persName>
who have ventured to follow me will be sufficiently provided for.
Your <persName>brother Henry</persName> for instance, has<placeName> eleven leagues of land,</placeName> <hi rend="italic">title
indisputable,</hi> for it is a <hi rend="italic">special grant</hi> direct <hi rend="italic">from government</hi> All
he has to [do] is to remove his <persName>family </persName>here this <date n="Fall-1831">fall </date>and settle 
permanently in the <placeName>Country</placeName>, take care of his land, and it will make his
<persName>children </persName>independent. But his <persName>family</persName><hi rend="italic"> must come this <date n="Fall-1831">fall </date></hi>or the
title will be defective; for another mistaken idea of the <persName>New Yorkers</persName>
is that land can be held here by <persName>persons who live in the <placeName>United
States</placeName></persName>. This is so far from being true that a <persName>man </persName>who lives here
and his <persName>family </persName>is elsewhere cannot hold land except as a single <persName>man</persName>;
and even that is doubtful, for his <hi rend="italic"><placeName>domicil </placeName></hi>must be here, and that is
considered to be where his <persName>family </persName>resides.</p>

<p>There is a vast opening in this <placeName>country </placeName>for <persName>emigrants</persName>. The <persName>old
inhabitants of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName></persName> would be well received by this <persName>Government</persName>
if a number of the <persName>French Creoles</persName> would apply to the <persName>Mexican
Consul</persName> for passports to remove to this <placeName>Colony</placeName>, or request him to
write officially to the Government in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>on the subject of an
emigration from <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>it would aid me some in my efforts to
get the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6th April 1830</date> stopping emigration from the <placeName>United
States</placeName>, modified or repealed.</p>

<p><persName>Negroes </persName>can be brought here under <persName>indentures</persName>, as <persName>servants</persName>, but
<hi rend="italic">not </hi>as <hi rend="italic"><persName>slaves</persName></hi>. This question of slavery is a difficult one to get on
with. It will ultimately be admitted, or the <persName>free negroes</persName> will be
formed by law into a separate and distinct class&#8212;<hi rend="italic">the <persName>laboring class</persName>.</hi>
Color forms a line of demarkation between them and the <persName>whites</persName>.
The law must assign their station, fix their rights and their 
disabilities and obligations&#8212;something between slavery and freedom,
but neither the one nor the other. Either this, or slavery in full
<hi rend="italic">must </hi>take place. Which is best? Quien Sabe? It is a difficult
and <hi rend="italic">dark </hi>question.</p>

<p>I am spinning out a long letter, and I fear a dry one. But as you
are about to remove here as a <persName>colonist </persName>I thought it would be 
satisfactory for you to know as much of the matter as possible, and as
some of your<placeName> New York</placeName> <persName>friends </persName>are in the <persName>Company </persName>operation you
might let them know that their ideas of my unfriendliness are all<pb n="677"/>
wrong. My motto is <hi rend="italic">Fidelity and gratitude to the <persName>Mexican 
government</persName>; and to he true to the interests and welfare of my <persName>colonists</persName>.
</hi>I will never deviate from this motto as long as I retain my senses.
Within the sphere of this duty any person may command me, but
beyond that I wish to be looked upon as a direct and open enemy.</p>

<p>I will set apart a <placeName>league of land</placeName> for you and hold it in reserve
until next <date n="Winter - 1831">winter </date>or <date n="Spring - 1832">spring</date>, and then if you remove here the title
will be made out and delivered to you, which is all the law will
permit. Besides this should you fancy a situation for a <placeName>settlement</placeName>
in any of<placeName> my own land</placeName> you shall have one, for the land you get from
government can be settled by a <persName>tenant</persName></p>

<p>On the <date when="1831-12-01">first of December</date> I leave for <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, the <placeName>seat of 
Government for our State, 550 miles distant</placeName>, and shall from necessity be
absent at least seven months&#8212;perhaps, a year, for I think of visiting
the <placeName>City of Mexico</placeName> before my return. Let me know, before that
time, all your wishes in relation to this <placeName>country</placeName>, and what I can do
for you, or any of your <persName>friends </persName>who may wish to settle here. <persName>Henry</persName>
says you wrote to me. I never received a line from you, and have
now written as though a month, and not <date n="xx-xx-1806">twenty five years</date> had 
intervened since we met or had any communication. I hope you will
follow my example, for it will be my greatest pleasure to hear from
you.</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
