<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1824-06-03">3. June 1824</date>.</p>
<p><persName>Colo. S. F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir, Your letter dated the <date when="1824-04-20">20 April</date> has just reached me
thro' the <placeName>post office</placeName>&#8212;and I have particularly noted the contents&#8212;<pb n="808"/></p>

<p>I have wrote you several times by persons going to the <placeName>Province</placeName>
Since the death of our much lamented friend <persName>Hawkins</persName>, giving an
account of the moneys he has Expended in Effecting the object,
now under consideration&#8212;and still hope some of my letters may
get safe to hand&#8212;</p>

<p>The amount which appears to have been so appropriated by him
Exceeds Thirty Thousand dollars&#8212;this includes the purchas of
Vessells, Cargoes, and disbursements to <persName>officers </persName>and <persName>seamen</persName>&#8212;Loans
to individuals traveling to and from the grant, who are unknown
to me, and lost to his <persName>Heirs </persName>Except as a charge to the grant&#8212;
payments made to you and on your draft&#8212;and the dreadfull Item of
Usurious Interest to money <persName>Brokers </persName>for loans at difft  times&#8212;</p>

<p>After the death of our friend <persName>Mrs. Hawkins</persName> made up her mind to
return to <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, leaving with me full power and authority to
transact all business connected with the Estate of her deceased 
<persName>Husband </persName>upon which she administered, and so far I have done all I
could do in Settling the Estate, but which from the nature of the
obligations of <persName>Mr Hawkins</persName> leaves but little to do, for he had 
mortgaged all his real property and the furniture was under Execution
at the time of his death&#8212;</p>

<p>I fully approve the resolution you have adopted with regard to
the <placeName>Texas property</placeName>, for it would now only be sacrificed if put in
his name, and pay none of the Debts&#8212;for I do not beleive if the
whole grant was put up at auction a Sale could be effected for One
Hundred dollars&#8212;Therefore the only plan wh. can avail <persName>Mrs 
Hawkins</persName> and her children is the one you have adopted&#8212;and the time
may come when it may make them independent&#8212;</p>

<p>I would answer your Enquires as to a Vessell for the purpose of
communicating with the <placeName>Brasos </placeName>if I could do So with any degree
of Satisfaction&#8212;I should however suppose one of 30 to 40 Tons
might be had for 1000 or 1200 $ pble [payable] one half Cash and
the balance at 6 or 8 months&#8212;but I have so little intercourse with
the Lake craft that my statemt is founded on uncertainty-</p>

<p><persName>General Wilkinson</persName> has not yet returned to <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, nor do we
expect him for some months yet&#8212;he remains as he says in letters
to his <persName>wife </persName>and <persName>Son</persName>, to close the accounts of Individuals who put
claims into his hands for advances to the Republic many years ago,
and which from all I can learn remain as much unsettled as the
day he reached <placeName>Mexico</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Nath. Cox</persName>.</p>
