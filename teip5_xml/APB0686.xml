<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to acknowledge the Receipt of your letter,
the date I cannot refer to as I am from home, I can only thank
you for the confidence you place in me,&#8212;I have made all the 
enquierys in my power for the carractors you requested but can 
procure nothing worth writing Prater was plundered of much of
his stock which is an evidence in his favour as I have not known
an instance of their stealing from each other&#8212;This part of this
<placeName>District </placeName>is setling very fast we have now a majority and have
punished and driven off most of the bad carractors, last week four
men made their escape from the <persName>officers </persName>sent to apprehend them from
the <placeName>upper settlement</placeName> about the Tenaha viz <persName>Jeffry Brown</persName> <persName>Henry
Brown</persName> <persName>James Hogan</persName> and <persName>Waller Hogan</persName> enough of their property
has been etatched to pay for the solen property and the expences</p>

<p>An order has been received here from <persName>Saleauder [Saucedo]</persName> at <placeName>St

<p>I am sorry that it is not in my power to send you the <persName>President</persName>'s
Message the following is from the best sources that the american
government will not interfere between <placeName>Spain </placeName>and her colonies but
if any other nation assists <placeName>Spain </placeName>the <placeName>United States</placeName> will immediately
assist the <placeName>Colonies </placeName>a <persName>minister </persName>has been sent to <placeName>France </placeName>to make
known this intention The <placeName>United States</placeName> are equiping three Ships
of the line and Frigate and Sloops of War for immediate service-

<placeName>England</placeName>, all Idea of the <placeName>Colonies </placeName>being invaded by a <persName>French army</persName>
is given up by the best informed people and it is supposed that

States</placeName>;</p>

<p>that the people are much dissatisfied with <persName>Austin </persName>think he has
no right to sell the lands that [he] compels every man to take a
league at $700 [to pay] half down that many would leave the 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>and that <persName>Austin </persName>will about abandon the <placeName>settlement </placeName>the mans
name was <persName>Gibbons</persName>. [He lived at the] <placeName>St Antonio crossing of the
Ba[Brazos]</placeName></p>
