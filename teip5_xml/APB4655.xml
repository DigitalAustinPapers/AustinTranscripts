<p>At. <placeName><persName>Bell</persName>s </placeName><date when="1834-07-25">Monday morning July 25, 1834</date></p>
<p>D Sir,</p>

<p>I enclose you a letter from <persName>Mr. Jack</persName> of <placeName>S. Fellipe</placeName> to <persName>Mr. 
McKinney</persName>&#8212;It contains some important information in regard to affairs<pb n="1086"/>
in the <placeName>interior</placeName>-&#8212;An open falling out between<persName> S. Anna</persName> and <persName>Congress</persName>&#8212;
But what I wish to call your attention to in the letter, is that part
of it which speaks of <persName>Mr. Almonte</persName> being in <placeName>S. Fellipe</placeName>, and his
opinions in regard to <persName>Colo Austin</persName>&#8212; The business of this <persName>Gentleman</persName>
in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, as he says himself&#8212;was to learn the actual condition of
things here, the feelings of the people etc. The <persName>Government </persName>
according to his statement, had been receiving contradictory rumors in
relation to <placeName>Texas </placeName>for a good while, some representing it preparing
for rebellion, and others again contradicting all this&#8212; It appears
he is well pleased with the appearance of things, and says he will
make favorable representations to the <persName>Government</persName>.&#8212; and gives
it as his opinion that <persName>Colo. Austin</persName> will soon be released&#8212;</p>

<p>This appears to put rather a <hi rend="italic">new face</hi> upon the subject&#8212;so much
so, that I have thought, you and others might be inclined to think
perhaps, that the trip of <persName>Jack </persName>and myself might be <hi rend="italic">unnecessary</hi>&#8212;
For myself I scarcely know what to think&#8212;the distractions in the
<placeName>Interior </placeName>make all judgment no better than <hi rend="italic">guessing</hi>-&#8212; In such a
state of things I am <hi rend="italic">doubtful </hi>of everything, and as much of any good
we can do by going on as of any thing else&#8212;</p>

<p>If the <persName>S. Anna party </persName>holds out a while, <persName>Almonte </persName>as he belongs to
it of course, will undoubtedly be able to do a great deal-&#8212; But if
the <persName>party </persName>goes down, perhaps his influence may go with it&#8212; But
of this we know nothing, and as I have said, can only guess-</p>

<p>As you are about to incur more <hi rend="italic">trouble </hi>and <hi rend="italic">expence </hi>in this business,
than any one else I thought it well to put you in possession of this
new view of the subject, that you might reflect upon it and conclude
as you pleased&#8212; It would be well for you I think to hold some
talk with the <persName>McNeils</persName>, and get the benefit of their opinions, as they
are pretty well qualified to judge of <persName>Mexican </persName>affairs,&#8212;and by all
means see <persName>McKinney</persName>, whose judgment on the matters would be no
less important&#8212;</p>

<p>Besides you know he has taken upon himself a good deal of
troubles-&#8212;which he would of course think it well enough to <hi rend="italic">save</hi>.
if there be no real necessity for it&#8212;</p>

<p>Whatever you may conclude on down there, I am certain will be
satisfactory up here, to<persName> Mr. Bell</persName> and others-</p>

<p>Do not think that I am getting reluctant or <hi rend="italic">faint </hi>hearted about
the trip, for I assure you I am <hi rend="italic">cheerfully </hi>disposed to make it if
necessary, and would be as ready to give it up, if those who are
more interested, in the <hi rend="italic">financial </hi>matters that relate to it should
advise in that way&#8212;</p>

<p>Decide on the matter therefore, without the least regard to any
feeling of mine particularly for I assure you I am quite <hi rend="italic">easy </hi>either
way&#8212;<pb n="1067"/></p>

<p>I think I can answer for <persName>Mr. Young</persName> [and] <persName>Mr. Jack</persName> in the same
way&#8212;</p>
