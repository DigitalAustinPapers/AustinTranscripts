<p>To <persName>Genl S. F. Austin<lb/>
Comd Genl of the Army of Texas</persName></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I should have written to you some time since but in consequence of the
rupture taking place some what sooner than I expected, and being so
buisily engaged, I could not. As respects the <persName>convention members</persName> was
elected from the <placeName>Mission </placeName>and <placeName>Guadalupe </placeName>and had proceeded on the way to
<placeName>St Filip</placeName>, I went myself to <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>in order to git a <persName>detachment </persName>to 
proceede and cut off <persName>Genl. Cos</persName>, on his road to <placeName>Bejar </placeName>But the plan was 
frustrated and he passed safe but he could have been taken as eisily as was
<placeName>Goliad </placeName>since my arrival here, I have acted as <persName>Quartermaster </persName>and have<pb n="190"/>
found, a good supply of Stores say 175 Barrels Flour with plenty of Sugar
coffee Rum whiskey wine etc, all are said to be private property so we have
had them removed <placeName>inside of the Church</placeName> and the Doors Baricaded for saiftey
It is reported that the <persName>people of <placeName>St Patricia</placeName></persName> have joined the <persName>Soldiers </persName>but
is generally supposed that it was through necessity, they must of course
be on the right side or they will belie their <persName>countrymen</persName>, the people? from
<placeName>Mission </placeName>have sent us <persName>25 men</persName> and are very zealous in the cause <persName>Mr Powers</persName>
is here also every endeavour that can be made on my part shall be done
I have only to request one thing do not throw away your shot use old
<persName>Putnam</persName>s order, Hopeing that God in his goodness may protect us</p>

<p><persName>John J. Linn</persName></p>
