<p><placeName>Natchitoches </placeName><date when="1826-09-15">Sept 15th 182</date>6</p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>I Accidentally met a <persName>Man </persName>who says he lives in your <placeName>Neighbourhood</placeName>
who will bring you a few papers such as in a hurry I can Scramble
together. I have been confined by Sickness some Months during
which I have had no opportunity of writing or knowing of any
conveyance to you&#8212;I understand some arrangements are taking place
for an exchange of Mails between <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and the <placeName>United States</placeName>&#8212;
Since the rising of Congress the <placeName>public papers</placeName> are less interesting,
they are all filled with the <date when="1826-07-04">4th of July</date> Proceedings and on the subject
of the Remarkable Coincident in the almost simultaneous death of
the <persName>ex President Adams</persName> and <persName>Jefferson </persName>on that day.&#8212;Our <placeName>country</placeName>
<placeName>from Sabine to St. Croix</placeName> seem engaged in devising and executing
Internal improvements The <placeName>canal cross the Base of Cape Florida
</placeName>will be important; Indeed all of them the <placeName>ohio canal</placeName>, with <placeName>one End
near the City of Cincinati</placeName> <placeName>the other Cleveland on Lake Eri</placeName>, the
<placeName>Chesepeak and Deleware Canal</placeName>, the <placeName>Cape Cod Canal</placeName>, one <placeName>from 
Michigan to Islenois</placeName>, and an hundred others; going on and talked about as
well as the great <placeName>Panama Canal</placeName>, a Number of Bailed way <placeName>Roads </placeName>and
<placeName>Turn Pikes</placeName> are going on; the great <placeName>Road from Washington to New
Orleans</placeName> will soon commence. Our <persName>Manufactures </persName>seem to keep pace
with other improvements. A Steam Boat Navigation will Certainly
be extended up <placeName>Red River</placeName> (perhaps) to <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>. In Our <placeName>Parish</placeName>
without seeming to be sickly there has been a Number of deaths<pb n="1456"/>
Those you know are <persName>Doctor Levis</persName> and <persName>Luke S. Hazelton</persName>. and <persName>Sam1
Keiser</persName> At <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> <persName>John Carson</persName>. <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> by the last 
accounts is uncommonly healthy. <persName>Genl Hampton</persName> is dead no 
conspicuous Character in the <placeName>City</placeName>, the yellow fever rages at <placeName>Mobile</placeName>. From
<placeName>Europe </placeName>the Riots in <placeName>England </placeName>and <placeName>Scotland </placeName>amongst the <persName>weavers</persName>.
<persName>factions </persName>in <placeName>Spain </placeName>opposed to the <persName>Kings party</persName>&#8212;<persName>France </persName>quiet and 
improving in <persName>Manufactures </persName>etc. The <persName>Govt of <placeName>Russia</placeName></persName> not well settled.
<placeName>Turkey </placeName>has been obliged to give up to that Power <placeName>Walatia </placeName>and
<placeName>Maldavia</placeName>, <placeName>(Antient Massadonia)</placeName>&#8212;The <persName>Greeks </persName>have suffered, but are
not giving up the ship. Private Opinion in all the countries of
<placeName>Europe </placeName>is warm towards them. <placeName>Turkey </placeName>is crippled by the War and
never can conquer them. Our <persName>Gov</persName>. is placing above us <placeName>On the Waters
of Red River and Arkansa</placeName> more than fifty thousand <persName>Indians </persName>of 
different and discordant <persName>Tribes </persName>I do not like the Policy, not for the
reason only, that it will hasten their extinction. The <persName>Caddos </persName>and
<persName>Quapas</persName>, are going to settle above you On the same <placeName>River</placeName>.&#8212;They
will be peacable, but unprofitable <persName>Neighbours</persName>.-&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Judge Johnston</persName> and <persName>family </persName>live at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, they were in <placeName>New
York</placeName> a <date n="08-xx1826">Month </date>ago. Our<persName> Members of Congress</persName> are all Reelected
from this <placeName>State</placeName>.</p>

<p>Please to Present my compliments to your <persName>brother </persName>to <persName>Capt. Clark</persName>
and any Other friend or acquantance.</p>

<p><persName>John Sibley</persName></p>

<p><persName>Hon. Judge Austin</persName></p>
