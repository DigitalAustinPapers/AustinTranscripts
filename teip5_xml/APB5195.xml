<p>My Dear Sir:&#8212;</p>

<p>I have diligently sought an interview with You, during your short stay
here:&#8212;but, not having been so fortunate as to find You at leisure,&#8212;even
for a few Moments permit me to use my Pen, and briefly lay before you
the following facts, etc relative to my intended Location and Settlement in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>:&#8212;And, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, my <hi rend="italic">efforts </hi>for the benefit of that <placeName>Country</placeName>, 1.&#8212;Thro
the medium of the <placeName>News-Papers</placeName>, I have re-published all the most valuable
and interesting Matter which has appeared relative to <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;together with
many original Articles, for the space of 2 Years past, especially thro' the
<placeName>Middle and Western parts of the State of New York</placeName>; by which a very 
general and ardent interest has been excited in its behalf, so that, besides the
small Colony which I bring with me, there are more than <hi rend="italic"><persName>100 Families</persName></hi> in
<placeName>Onondaga </placeName>and <placeName>adjacent Counties</placeName>, many of them being quite independent
as to Property, who, if <hi rend="italic">we (pioneers) succeed</hi> in effecting our Location,<pb n="367"/>
and send back a <hi rend="italic">good report,</hi> will immediately follow us into <placeName>Texas</placeName>;&#8212;
2 I have been the cause of a number of <persName>Families emigrating to <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, who
have resided there for some time,&#8212; 3.&#8212;Also of sending a number of
hardy <persName>Volunteers </persName>(15 or 20 at least) to aid her in the great and glorious
struggle for Independence. 4. I wish to settle in your fine <placeName>Country</placeName>,
on account of the <hi rend="italic">health </hi>of my <persName>Family</persName>&#8212;to make myself useful as a 
<persName>Missionary</persName>&#8212;and intend, that the <persName>Families </persName>I take with me shall constitute my
first <persName>Congregation</persName>. The only difficulty, of moment, with which we now
have to contend, is, our long and expensive delay, and especially in a 
climate where Neither our healths nor lives are <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>, should we be obliged
to remain many weeks beyond the present time:&#8212;Moreover, I have only
about <hi rend="italic">one fourth the means</hi> necessary to transport these <persName>families </persName>to <placeName>Texas</placeName>;
and, having no <hi rend="italic">certainty </hi>and obtaining remittances from <placeName>N. York, </placeName>sooner
than abt 7 or 8 Weeks hence; I am therefore obliged <hi rend="italic">to remain here until</hi>
those remittances <hi rend="italic">arrive</hi>&#8212;or until I can, <hi rend="italic">myself succeed</hi> in raising the
requisite means to take my People on.&#8212; This has been a sad delay for Us
all.&#8212; I trust we shall be enabled to go on soon, and be permitted to Locate,
where at least we shall be enabled to preserve both our Healths and our
Lives;&#8212; My present plan&#8212;As soon as I can get ready&#8212;to take our people
on to the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Nachez Bluffs</placeName></hi>, and let them remain there for a time, upon the
<placeName>Lands of <persName>A. C. Allen </persName>and <persName>E. A. Baldwin Esqr</persName>s</placeName>, and occupy a number of
<placeName>Buildings </placeName>belonging to them there.&#8212;Should &#8212;(finally) the interest which
I have so long and so warmly taken in the welfare of <placeName>Texas </placeName>be so 
considered by yourself and the <persName>Government</persName>, as to expedite our Location, I shall
be very glad, and shall have renewed cause to extend my labors and 
exertions in so good a cause.&#8212; Permit me again to solicit your kind aid and
influence in our behalf:&#8212; I am, Dr. Sir, with great Respect</p>

<p><persName>R. Salmon</persName>.</p>

<p>To <persName>Genl S. F. Austin</persName></p>
