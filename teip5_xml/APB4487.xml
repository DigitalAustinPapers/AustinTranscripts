<p><placeName>District of Teneha, Texas</placeName>,</p>

<p><date when="1832-11-30">November 30th 1832</date>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your letter of the <date when="1832-11-18">18th</date>, current came [to] hand <date when="1832-11-29">late last evening</date>.
The one you mention as giving an account of our "political 
situation," has not been received, nor any other except the one of the <date when="1832-11-18">18th</date>.</p>

<p>Rumor is busy with her thousand tongues, but we know nothing
of the interior, not even whether <persName>Mr. Wharton</persName> is gone or not.</p>

<p>Our military elections are in a very unpleasant situation, and the
<persName>sub committee of this <placeName>district</placeName></persName> have wrote to the <persName>Chairman of the
central committee</persName> on the subject; but we are fearful that he has
not as yet received the letter.</p>

<p>I am told that there is an opportunity of forwarding this letter
by a <persName>Mr Burk</persName> provided it is <placeName>at the Big Road </placeName>by twelve of the
clock <date when="1832-11-30">to-day</date>, but for this I should have taken your letter down and
conversed with some of the <persName>principal citizens in the <placeName>Aysh District</placeName></persName>
on the subject of it before I wrote you an answer. But as it is, I
will with pleasure give you my opinion fully and frankly "that I
think the <persName>Americans </persName>in <placeName>these three districts </placeName>would gladly embrace
the project of uniting with the <persName>people of <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> and <placeName>the rest of
Texas</placeName> in forming a <persName>provisional government</persName> on the basis that <placeName>Texas</placeName>
is a part of the <placeName>Mexican confederation</placeName>, and will so remain and that
we are all <persName>Mexicans </persName>and will rigidly procet [protect] all the rights
and interests of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. ["]</p>

<p>The idea of a <persName>separate, distinct, and independent government</persName> I
do not believe exists in the mind of <persName>any man of common sense in
the <placeName>district</placeName></persName>. Nor do they want to belong to the <placeName>United States of
the North</placeName>, there are some fiew exceptions to this last opinion, but
not many, scarsely one to ten.</p>

<p>They have come to the <placeName>country </placeName>to participate of the benefits of
the <placeName>Mexican Independence</placeName>, and of their liberal policy in regard to
land, and they wish to continue so. The idea of Texas being
independent and forming a nation is absurd. The very expenses of
supporting the Government could they have it, would render them
the most oppressed people. Besides their weakness would invite
aggression.</p>

<p>They want a <persName>provisional Government</persName>&#8212;they want a judiciary&#8212;
the present system is little or no protection to their <persName>persons or
property</persName>.</p>

<p>I will write you more at large on this subject, but at present am
in such fear of loosing the opportunity of conveyance, that I am
not able to write as I other wise would.<pb n="896"/></p>

<p>I hope you will continue to write and give me an account of the
political complection of the <placeName>interior</placeName>.</p>

<p>Be pleased to direct your letter to me at <placeName>Teneha </placeName>to be left at
<placeName><persName>Mr Philip </persName>Sublet's Big Road.   Ayish District</placeName>.</p>

<p>Be so good as to present my respects to <persName>Mr. Williams</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>J. Harrison</persName></p>

<p><persName>Colonel S. F. Austin</persName></p>
