<p>Col. <persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Dear Sir but a short time since <persName>Mr Nester Clay </persName>came to this
<placeName>place</placeName>. I accidentally fell in his <persName>company</persName>, and he told me he had
been wishing to speak to me on the subject of the Tax law and 
proceeded to make many violent remarks amongst which was the
following: I will never pay one cent of the taxes while I am able
to raise arms against it the best <persName>men </persName>in the <placeName>country </placeName>will oppose
it with force and arms. You would be astonished to know who they
are. You had better pay it yourself if it costs all you are worth,
than to attempt collecting the Taxes, by God we will have a <placeName>Boston</placeName>
Tea Scrap of it, we will come armed and show you whether you
will collect it. I know my <persName>neighbors </persName>will join me, and if you
report us in a state of rebellion, we will take no other notice of you
than to Tar and feather you, and many other remarks of a similar
kind.<persName> Mr. T. M. Duke</persName> and<persName> H. Cheves</persName> was present and paid 
attention to the conversation, he is the sort of <persName>charactors </persName>that has always
kept this <placeName>community </placeName>in an uproar, and has always broke down order
and established confusion it is my duty as an <persName>officer of this municipality</persName> to inform you of all such outrage, for now is the time to put
a check to Such <persName>Charactors</persName>,    this is therefore to inform your self<pb n="316"/>
and the honorable the <persName>Commissioner General of the State </persName>that the
facts as above stated is just and true all of which I am prepared to
prove</p>
