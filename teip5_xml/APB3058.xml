<p>Deeming it to be the duty of every <persName>man </persName>to deal with perfect Candour with his fellow <persName>Citizens </persName>as regards his pecuniary situation,
and also as an act of justice to my <persName>family</persName> to prevent them from
being improperly harrassed by the presecution of unjust claims
against the <persName>property </persName>brought by them to this <placeName>Country</placeName> I have Considered it to be my duty to give public notice that the <persName>Negroes</persName> and
property brought by myself and <persName>family</persName> to this <placeName>Colony</placeName>, are actually
and bona fide the <persName>property </persName>of my <persName>Wife</persName> and <persName>Children</persName>, being in part
the dotal <persName>estate of my Wife</persName> given to her by her <persName>parents</persName> and brought
into the Marriage as her own individual <persName>property</persName>, and the balance
is to make up for such parts of my <persName>Wife</persName>s said dotal <persName>estate</persName> as had
been used and disposed of by me and was conveyed to my said <persName>Wife</persName>
and <persName>children</persName> by a regular deed of trust bearing date <date when="1820-12-20">20 december
1820</date> and which deed is on record  <placeName>in the office of the <persName>Parish Judge
of Rapide</persName> in Louisiana</placeName>, and also in the <placeName>Office of <persName>Stephen F. Austin
Judge of this Colony</persName></placeName>, therefore no Claims whatever against me can <pb n="1256"/>
in any manner have any liens on or against said <persName>property </persName>or its
proceeds, this notice is given to prevent any <persName>person </persName>from being
deceived by purchasing Claims from the <placeName>United States</placeName> on me, for
a part of those Claims are unjust, every just claim however on
me shall be paid As soon as circumstances will admit, but the <persName>property </persName>itself or its&#8212;proceeds Can not be taken for any Claims whatever against me for the reasons above stated.
