Industry to maintain <persName>herself </persName>and <persName>children </persName>her situation language<pb n="1613"/>
can't Express and God above onley knows her suffering, to think
that <persName>Hunter </persName>should be permitted to destroy that pore unhapy <persName>woman</persName>
by his persuading her to take some medisin, and she was sworn on
trial, and she states that he was to cure her and the charge would not
exced seven Dollars, he state there was no contract, but swore to his
account and not supported by other evidence as I thought to find
a Judgement there appears that by some stratagim or other there is
an account put with the papers which was not on trial or before the
<persName>arbitrators </persName>for near $30. and upon what grounds the <persName>arbitrators</persName>
found a judgement I'm not able to judge, and at the rendition of
the judgement an appeal was applyed for and the aplycation Entered
I was to enter hir security, I started down to the coast and did not
get back as soon as I expected on account of the weather when I
returned the time of Ten days had relaps,d so that she cant get
an appeal, the <persName>Alcalda </persName>informs me. If I have under stood your
opinion we did not gow upon formality but to give Justice, and this
case calls for Justice your absence has stop,d the <persName>widow </persName>from seeing
you there can be more Evidence produced and when your honour
Has the depositions before you you will be the better <persName>judge</persName>, repoart
says [he] has produced to a petition to you that he is a sober <persName>man </persName>and
so fourth if so it is not correct, if you have formed a good opinion
of him you are mistaken in the man and you will be better informed
