<p>Sir</p>

<p>By the request of a very particular friend of mine, I am induced
to address you for information relative to your projected 
<placeName>establishment on the Trinity</placeName>&#8212;Having as yet never seen any map of the prov-<pb n="446"/>
ince of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, I am not able to form a correct notion of yr location-
It would be desirable to learn when you design to lay down yr grant&#8212;
Upon what terms you solicit emigration? What inducements the
prospect holds out? If, as I suppose, <placeName>Galveston Island</placeName> must be
made the place of deposit from whence shipments of produce are to
be made, what security the <persName>shiper </persName>could have against the 
depredations of the <persName>marauders </persName>who it is to be expected will continue to
infest that bay.</p>

<p>All these and any other information which you can give would be
thankfully received&#8212;My <persName>friend </persName>could probably take with him about
twenty <persName>negroes </persName>and perhaps a poor white <persName>family </persName>consisting of a man
and his <persName>wife</persName>.</p>

<p>Have the kindness to reply to this directed to me at <placeName>Donaldsonville [Louisiana?]</placeName> 
where I shall be in a week from this time directed
to my friend <persName>Thos. C. Nicholls Esqr</persName> resident there&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>G. Pearce</persName></p>
<p>I have been informed that several vessels sailed from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>
lately for yr. establishment wi[th] persons designing to make a 
location there&#8212;If not inconsistant wt yr  views, I would like to learn
what number and character they may be.</p>
