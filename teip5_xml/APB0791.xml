<p>[June &#8212; 1824.]</p>
<p>The <persName>inhabitants </persName>living in the <placeName>Colony </placeName>formed by the <persName>Empresario
Stephen F. Austin</persName> on the <placeName>Brazos and Colorado Rivers</placeName> in the
<placeName>Province of Texas</placeName> being desirous to be and for ever remain in
perfect peace and harmony with all the tribes of <persName>Indians</persName>, and 
cosidering that the <persName>Wecos </persName><persName>Tawacaneys </persName>and <persName>Toweasses </persName>on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName><pb n="844"/>
are our nigh <persName>neighbors </persName>and that the mutual convenience and interest
of the <persName>settlers </persName>as well as of those <persName>Indians </persName>requires that the most
perfect friendship and harmony should prevail between them, and
that a clean commercial intercourse should be established and kept
up between this <placeName>Colony </placeName>and those <persName>Indians </persName>which it has been 
represented is the sincere wish and desire of the <persName>chief of those tribes</persName>.</p>

<p>Therefore I <persName>Stephen F. Austin Lieut Col of Militia Empresario
of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> charged with the administration of its civil affairs
and the preservation of good order do by these presents appoint
                   as <persName>Commissioners </persName>to visit said <persName>Indians </persName>on the
part of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of this <placeName>Colony </placeName>and to represent to them
that our objects in settling in this country are purely of an 
agricultural nature, that we have settled under the authority and by the
permission of the <persName>Supreme powers of the <placeName>Mexican nation</placeName></persName>, that we
view all the <persName>Indians tribes</persName> as our <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>brothers </persName>and wish
to live in peace and trade freely with all, and as the <persName>Wecos </persName>and
their <persName>neighbors </persName>and the <persName>Mexicans </persName>have always been <persName>friends </persName>we wish
to establish a friendly understanding with them and offer them our
hands as <persName>brothers</persName>, who will be always willing to trade with them
and receive them as our <persName>friends</persName>&#8212;and that there may arise no 
misunderstanding on the subject the <persName>settlers </persName>have sent up the said
to talk with them and form a lasting treaty
of peace and friendship for ever&#8212;</p>
