<p>To Messrs. <placeName>Austin</placeName>, <placeName>Archer</placeName>, and <placeName>Wharton</placeName></p>

<p><persName>Late Commissioners of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName></p>

<p>Gentlemen</p>

<p>Enclosed you will find a copy of an application made by me to acquire
the right of a <persName>Colonist of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, The original, I in person handed to
<persName>S. M. Williams esq</persName>, at <placeName>Velasco</placeName>, as he, at that period was acting for <persName>S. F.
Austin Esq</persName>, my object in tendering a copy is for the purpose of obtaining<pb n="396"/>
a certificate of citizenship under that date, I trust that through your 
influence the <hi rend="italic">right </hi>applied for, will be unhesitatingly granted, You well
know Gentlemen I have been strictly devoted to the interest of <placeName>Texas</placeName>; That
through your instigation I declined receiving consignments of Merchandise
and consequently, that chance of resource was entirely cut off, Leaving me
for the present ruined in commercial prospects, which I should not value
if my credit had not been deeply injured by the unjustifyable proceedings
of your <persName>Cabinet</persName>, At the period the <persName>agency of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> was accepted by me
her prospects were so deeply shrouded in doubt that you were refused by
several the aid I promptly rendered&#8212; You will recollect one person only,
was willing to accept the office (and only one) on condition that I would
take all the responsibilities, all the trouble, and he the profit, and the
title&#8212; When I refused the proposal, it was far from my belief that a 
<persName>Cabinet </persName>representing an enterprising and honorable population would sanction
the proceedings of a few treacherous, interested persons, to bring disgrace
and ruin upon the only person who disinterestedly stood by them through
their days of darkness&#8212; In a few days I trust to submit to your perusal a
correct statement of all the transactions between the <persName>Government of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
</persName>and their <persName>agents in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></persName></p>

<p><persName>Wm. Bryan</persName></p>
