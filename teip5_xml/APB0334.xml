<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I have seen <persName>Doctor Andrews</persName> and learned from him that no orders
of Survey could be had for our locations in this country and untill
then nothing can be done with the claims&#8212; the locations we have
made are considered by every one to be the best that could have
been made in the country and will certainly yeild a handsome profit
the moment they can be brought into market. The <placeName>little Rock</placeName> is
universally spoken of as the seat of Government and both the other
places are good <placeName>Town scites</placeName>&#8212;I wrote you from <placeName>Herculanium </placeName>not
to purchase any more claims on our agreement untill you heard
from me, and since my return to this <placeName>country </placeName>I have sold out the
whole of my interest in the locations to <persName>Mr James Bryan</persName> who has
become responsable for the regular payment of the money due on
them The most important points being secured I do not wish to
enter any further into the speculation and therefore shall consider
our arrangement as to the purchase of more claims to be annulled,
no more claims of course have been purchased on that arrangement
as I wrote you from <placeName>Herculanium </placeName>not to purchase any more. <persName>Mr.
Bryan</persName> perhaps will enter into the speculation with you if you wish
though there is no use in locating claims without you get an order
of Survey, you will please give up to <persName>Mr Bryan</persName> the Power of
Attorney I gave you to purchase claims, the claim of 240 arpents
in which you have an interest of 1/8 is yet unlocated in the hands<pb n="345"/>
of <persName>Mr Bryan</persName>, you and him can arrange as you may think best as
to any further arrangements&#8212;   Please write me what the <persName>Bank </persName>is
doing and what is the prospect of getting money from the <persName>Johnson</persName>s.</p>

<p>Please give my compliments to your <persName>mother </persName>and <persName>Lady</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>.</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. Wm. M. Ohara</persName> <placeName>St Louis</placeName></p>
