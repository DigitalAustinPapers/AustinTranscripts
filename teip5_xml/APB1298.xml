<p>Some time since I received a Summons in a cause between <persName>Thomas
Earle</persName>, and <persName>N. Lynch</persName>, from the hands of a <persName>Boy </persName>as a <persName>witness</persName>, and
being on the Eve of going to the <placeName>U. S</placeName>. I applied to the <persName>parties </persName>and
informed them that on this day I would give my Testimony of
what I knew respecting of what I knew in this suit.&#8212;The <persName>Alcalda</persName>
did not appear according to appointment&#8212;This places me out of
the chance of sending my deposition or appearing, without 
considerable damage to myself.&#8212;I therefore transmit to you all I know
which I do not consider of importance in no way&#8212;Before <persName>Lynch</persName>
started to <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> I handed him a one hundred note with a
Bill of articles that I wished him to bring me from that place he
told that he did not know whether he could carry the vessell (The
Augusta) into <placeName>Orleans </placeName>or not as there was a debt against her there,
but said, that he would leave the vessell and go to <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, and if,
the debt stood there against her, he would endeavor to get some
craft to bring such articles to the schooner; and not go with the
vessell into that <placeName>port</placeName>, on this conversation he took the note and
bill, and observed to me, if the vessell should unavoidably be seised
in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> (which he would not allow if it was possible to avoid)
if he might make use of a part of this money to endeavor to get
her or some other vessell to return to this <placeName>bay</placeName>, I told him that
he might&#8212;This is all I know I am willing to be Qualified to this
statement and should have been if the <persName>alcalda </persName>had appeared<persName>&#8212;N
Lynch</persName> has paid me the ballance on his return over the articles I
sent for&#8212;</p>
