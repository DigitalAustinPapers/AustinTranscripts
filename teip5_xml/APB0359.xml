<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>I have been examining your <placeName>Caddo store</placeName> accounts with a view of
Selecting the best of them to put in a train for collection, I have done
the best I could and put a Small amount in the hands of <persName>officers </persName>for
collection and <persName>Alley </persName>must be here to prove them, The <placeName>Saline </placeName>is
in opperation and there is about 500 bushels of Salt on hand, but it
will not Sell for any thing&#8212; <persName>Poston </persName>is doing the best he can and is
out of provisions, which cannot be had here without the Silver
Bacon at 25cts and corn 1,00 to 2,00 I have therefore Sent out <persName>Alley</persName>
to the <placeName>Arkensaw </placeName>for you to procure bacon or Pork&#8212;there and send
to this place by <persName>Orr </persName>in the waggon and he can take back a load of
Salt also send some Flour unless you do this the <placeName>Saline </placeName>will have
to stop&#8212; I have taken an inventory of every thing here and shall
start to the <placeName>Mount </placeName><date when="1820-06-03">tomorrow </date>and think shall be able to sell the works
to <persName>Wilson</persName>, <persName>Browne </persName>from whom you borrowed the money called on
me and is in distress for One hundred Dolls and says that if he can
get that much he will wate for the balance. I have promised to try
and get it If you cannot save your <placeName>Property in the upper country
</placeName>without taking Money from here I fear it will be Sold, for I have
no hopes of getting a Dollar for you in this <placeName>country </placeName><persName>Mrs Hemphill</persName>
will Sue you the moment you arrive here as will also <persName>Browne </persName>and<pb n="364"/>
<persName>Mrs Bear</persName> unless I can get the 100 Dos for <persName>Browne</persName>&#8212; If my <persName>Father</persName>
should come to <placeName>Little Rock</placeName> you may tell him that I wish to go to
the <placeName>Mouth of White River </placeName>to live if I can take any thing there to
begin with and if that cannot be done I shall go down <placeName>the Mississippi</placeName>
and seek employ</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>The <persName>Postons</persName> had no intentions to injure you by what they have
done but to befriend you and keep others from attaching who would
not have been as friendly as they will&#8212;</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James Bryan</persName> <placeName>Little Rock.</placeName></p>
