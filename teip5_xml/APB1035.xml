turbulent characters to cause great trouble. Suggests organization of local government there as the settlers request, and asks for permit to settle 300 additional families in his colony. Sends map of Galveston Bay.</add></p>

<p>Most Excellent Sir :</p>

<p>As soon as I became advised of the organization of our Honorable
Congress, and the creation of the respectable <persName>authorities </persName>of the
<placeName>State</placeName>, I had the honor to address your <persName>Eccellency </persName>officially, presenting
the respects of myself and the new <persName>colonists</persName>, in manifesting
our obedience to the law, and whatever may tend to the general
weal; representing to your <persName>Excellency </persName>at the same time, the actual
state of these <placeName>colonies</placeName>, and requesting such orders might be 
communicated to me, as deemed necessary, in order to enable me to
put them into immediate execution. The liberal protection which
our <persName>government </persName>extends to <persName>foreigners</persName>, who are desirous to 
establish themselves under our Federal Government; and the fertility
of this soil are Such, that new and respectable <persName>families</persName> are 
continually arriving here, to enjoy the privileges granted to <persName>settlers</persName>;
but as the number of <persName>three hundred</persName>, which I engage to Settle, is
already completed, I cannot permit them to locate without the 
permission of your <persName>Excellency</persName>, nor can I distribute <placeName>lands </placeName>to them,
in consequence of which the greater part of them have remained
on the <placeName>Rivers Trinity</placeName> and <placeName>Neches</placeName>, <placeName>beyond the limits of my
boundaries</placeName>. These <persName>families </persName>being <persName>farmers</persName>, and of most industrious 
habits, have no leisure to encourage vice, but dedicate their
whole time to the maintenance of themselves, the accumulation
of wealth, and the observance of the laws; but they are without
any municipal regulations, and consequently suffer considerable
inconvenience from the perverseness of turbulent <persName>persons</persName>, who 
emigrate from the <placeName>neighboring nation</placeName>; and also from our own; and
who, although few in number remain there and occupy lands 
because there is no <persName>local authority</persName> to punish or restrain their 
iniquities; the evil effects of such a <placeName>community</placeName>, has some influence,
even in this <placeName>colony</placeName>.<pb n="1035"/></p>

<p>The deep interest I take in the prosperity of the <placeName>State</placeName>, seeing that
the <persName>families </persName>above-mentioned are wealthy and possess adequate
means; that lands have not been apportioned to them; that they
will be under the necessity (unless promptly attended to) of returning 
to <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>; in which event, we shall lose these valuable and
useful members of society. All this, I say, compels me to submit to
the high consideration of your <persName>Excellency</persName>, the situation of the <persName>inhabitants </persName>
of the <placeName>Trinity</placeName> and <placeName>Neches</placeName>; and to inform your <persName>Excellency</persName>
of the continual applications they are making to be organized.
Your <persName>Excellency </persName>will, notwithstanding, determine in the matter,
that which may be most suitable. Your <persName>Excellency </persName>is well aware
that the Savage <persName>Indians</persName> infesting <placeName>Texas</placeName> are numerous; that they
will use every exertion to prevent themselves from being streightened,
or brought under subjection to the laws, by the <persName>settlers</persName>, and doubtless, we shall feel the effects of this disposition on their part; and as
the number of <persName>families </persName>is only three hundred, we are scarcely able
to defend <persName>ourselves </persName>against them, without attempting offensive 
operations of warfare; but if your <persName>Excellency </persName>will grant me permission 
to settle three hundred <persName>families </persName>more in the same manner as
those already settled I will locate them on the <placeName>upper Brazo</placeName>s and
<placeName>Colorado</placeName>, on the <placeName>San Antonio Road</placeName>; thereby augmenting our physical force, 
and by being in communication with the <persName>colonists</persName> already
bettled, will at the same time prevent the incursions of the <persName>Tehuacanos</persName>,
and the great depredations which they commit on those <placeName>roads</placeName>, and
even at <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>. Should your <persName>Excellency </persName>be pleased to accede to
the establishment of this <placeName>new settlement</placeName>, I guarantee, that, it shall
be effected forthwith; and the evils which we are now suffering, will
be remedied; I reiterate to your <persName>Excellency</persName>, that, the only motive
which animates me, is the desire to contribute as a true Citizen, to
the happiness and prosperity of the <placeName>Mexican nation</placeName> to which I
have the glory to belong.</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency, a small map of
the <placeName>Island</placeName> and <placeName>Bay of Galveston</placeName>, a highly interesting <placeName>Sea-Port</placeName> and
the best in the <placeName>State</placeName>, as is evident to your <persName>Excellency</persName>. The map is
not as perfect as I could wish, for the want of proper instruments,
but I shall very shortly be able to send you another more correct,
and on a larger scale; for the present, I only beg of you to condescend
to receive this as an indication of my best wishes.</p>

<p>God and Liberty,</p>

<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName>, <date when="1825-02-04">4th February 1825</date>.</p>

<p>Most Excellent Sir,</p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>To <persName>His Excellency the Governor</persName>, of the <placeName>State of Coahuila and
Texas</placeName>.</p>
