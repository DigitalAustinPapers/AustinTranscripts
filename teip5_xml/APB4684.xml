<p><placeName>Mexico</placeName>, <date when="1834-10-15">October 15, 1834</date>.</p>
<p><persName>Mr. Geo. Fisher</persName></p>

<p>Dr. Sir, I sincerely congratulate you on the appointment you have recd
in the <placeName>custom house of Matamoros</placeName>, and hope you may long continue to
enjoy prosperity and peace,</p>

<p>The experience of the last few years has taught me a great deal&#8212;I have<pb n="9"/>
learned more of mankind, and of the human passions than I was ever 
willing to believe before&#8212; My frankness and open, candid, good faith has
involved me in many difficulties&#8212;and my confidence in Others has 
entangled me very much, but all this will be useful to me for the future&#8212;that
is if I ever get out of this <placeName>prison</placeName>, which I hope to do soon&#8212;</p>

<p>Two of my <persName>friends </persName>arrived today from <placeName>Texas</placeName>, with representations in my
favor from the <persName>Ayuntamtos of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> and <persName>Govt of the <placeName>State of Coahuila and
Texas</placeName></persName>, wrhich I think will have a favourable effect.</p>

<p>On the <date when="1834-10-06">6th of this month</date> I wrote to my <persName>friends </persName>in <placeName>Texas </placeName>on the subject
of representing, but as the above representations have arrived, it will not
now be necessary for them to do so, and I must request the favor of you
to write to my <persName>brother in law James F Perry</persName> care of <persName>M. A. Bryan</persName> <placeName>San
Felipe</placeName> informing him that the representations sent by <persName>Mr. Grayson</persName> have
been recd and that he need not procure any more, as I requested him to
do in my letter to him date <date when="1834-09-06">6th of last month</date>&#8212; I presume you will receive
this letter before<persName> Capt. Offutt</persName> leaves <placeName>Matamoros</placeName>, and you can write by
him&#8212; It will be best to send this letter to<persName> Mr. Perry</persName>&#8212; I wish it also
for another reason which is this&#8212;I have long since informed my 
in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, that I am satisfied with you, and was your friend&#8212; By sending
this letter they will have an additional evidence of the terms of friendship
on which we stand, I will take this occasion to thank you, for the letters
and statements you have written to this city in my favor-&#8212; The only time
to try friendship is when a man is in misfortune and persecuted by a host
of powerful <persName>enemies </persName>as I am&#8212; You have interested yourself for me even
at the risk of injuring yourself&#8212; I wish my family to know this&#8212;they,
will not forget it&#8212; For these reasons I wish you to send this letter to
my <persName>brother in law James F. Perry</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I am in better spirits, and my prospects are much better than they were
when <persName>Capt. Offutt</persName> left and I hope that a few months will release me from
my long and dreary imprisonment.</p>

<p>My motto has always been <hi rend="italic">fidelity to <placeName>Mexico</placeName></hi>&#8212; I have never deviated
from it&#8212;but I have been greatly entangled by others, and by circumstances
that I could not controul&#8212; I have suffered much, but a clear and quiet
conscience has enabled me to bear it with fortitude, There is nothing new
except what you will see in the public papers&#8212;that is nothing that I know
of&#8212;all is peace and <hi rend="italic">Federacion </hi>seems to be the Order of the day&#8212; Some
however think that <date n="01-xx-1834">January </date>and <date n="02-xx-1834">February </date>will be stormy months&#8212; Congress have certainly a very difficult and delicate task before them&#8212; God<pb n="10"/>
give them wisdom and prudence to regulate matters so as to insure peace
and prosperity to this republic.</p>
