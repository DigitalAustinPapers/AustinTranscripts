<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>I ask leave to introduce to your acquaintance my son <persName>Mr. N. D.
Ellis</persName>, and to acknowledge the receipt of your favor by my friend<pb n="329"/>
<persName>Col A Winston</persName>. I wish to say to you that we have been led into an
error by a proclamation of the <persName>Mexican president </persName>as to the 
liberation of <persName>slaves</persName>. Perhaps he only meant <persName>bound servants</persName> such as has
been by the civil Law for 200 years, but you know such is the sensitive
feelings of the <persName>Slave holders</persName> on that subject, that the least agitation
will deter them from emigration, and I really begin to believe with
you that it is shortly to be a great evil among us. for it has 
prevented me from sending on <persName>negros </persName>to my son in Law <persName>James N.
Smith</persName> until it is too late to make a crop. The first objection is the
expense of sending them on, at this late season, and a person to 
superintend them, the second is, every practical <persName>planter </persName>knows it is too
late to make a crop even to <hi rend="italic">rent land</hi>; (the worst of all evils) but
the 3rd is one which I know will plead my excuse to you; when I
state my own situation, for it seems one misfortune never comes
alone but (as <persName>Shakespear </persName>says) treads on the heels of another; 2 or
3 months after the date of the last receipt of the payt of <persName>W. Pettus</persName>'s
debts, (as this will show) I had the<date when="1830-01-12"> 12th instant</date>, a large portion of
my cotton crop burnt to ashes <placeName>in the warehouse of the <persName>Messrs. Harts
</persName>in the city of New Orleans</placeName> and <persName>Mr. J. N. Smith</persName>'s with it. I refer
you to my son for the amt. and the details; (<hi rend="italic">not insured</hi>) Please
accept my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p><persName>Richard Ellis</persName>.</p>
<p><persName>Colo. S. F. Austin</persName></p>
