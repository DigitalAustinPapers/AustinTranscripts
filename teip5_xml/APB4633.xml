<p><persName>R. M. Williamson Esq</persName></p>

<p>D. Sir I received yours of the <date when="1834-02-09">9th Ult.</date> and avail my self of this
opputunity, to write you in answer. I arrived in this place <date when="1834-03-09">yesterday</date>
All in good health. Nothing important in my last tour in the <placeName>Upper
Country</placeName>.</p>

<p>I shall leave hear as soon as I can get some supplies from the <placeName>lower
country</placeName>&#8212;-I can be found on the <placeName>yegua </placeName>or its waters.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Moore</persName> will give you a plot of the much desired single league.
I have trayersed <placeName>Willis Creek and Vally</placeName> some twenty or thirty
miles.   Land good but a scarcity of Timber.</p>

<p><placeName><persName>Hoxey</persName>s 10 league tract on San Gabriel</placeName> is not as I could have wished
it, the survey takes but little of the <placeName>River</placeName>, your <placeName>Creek </placeName>runs diagonally
through it, the cutting off six leagues has made the tract much less
valuable than it would have been, however it is such an error as
might have been made by much closer observers than either you or I.</p>

<p>Your friend <persName>Doct. Pollard</persName> can be accommodated, either in the
<placeName>Brazos </placeName>or <placeName>San Andres</placeName> as he may wish, <persName>Mr. Moore</persName> will give you or
the <persName>Doctor </persName>such information as we are in possession of, from which
you must determine.</p>

<p>I find the <persName>Robinson </persName>fever raging in this peaceful land, and am 
informed that it is raging below in a way calculated to alarm the fears
of every well wisher of peace and harmony. Is <placeName>Texas </placeName>like <placeName>Mexico</placeName>
destined to <hi rend="italic">commotions </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Civil Wars?</hi> I hope not, but fear the
result of this damnable contagious poisen emitted throughout the
Land by <persName>Robinson </persName>and his <persName>sattelites</persName>.</p>

<p>Some efficient measures must be taken to check this <persName>mad-man</persName>, or
means used to quiet the minds of a deluded and distracted people,
otherwise confusion and probably its attendant (Blood-shed) must
be the result. The cole when properly kindeled may burst out in a
flame that will consume <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>Much preparation and big talk at this place by the <persName>party</persName>, I have
not yet seen or had any conversation with them but will in a short
time.</p>

<p>Give me all the news you have, I have been where I could hear
nothing and here what I get is worse than nothing. I am sometimes
ready to say that I will turn Hermit, live with the <persName>Indians </persName>or quit
this Hole of Confusion.<pb n="1048"/></p>

<p>Present my respects to all the boys and accept the same for
yourself.</p>

<p><persName>F. W. JOHNSON  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>E. M. Williamson Esq </persName><placeName> Sanfelipi de Austin. Texas</placeName></p>
