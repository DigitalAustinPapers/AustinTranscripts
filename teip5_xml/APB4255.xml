<p><placeName>Mexican Consulate<lb/>
New Orleans </placeName><date when="1831-08-11">Augt 11 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir By an arrival <date when="1831-08-10">yesterday </date>I am favored with a 
communication from <persName>Mr George Fisher</persName> dated <date when="1831-07-06">6 July</date>, in which he says you
are in want of a Copy of your officio to him of the <date when="1831-06-05">5th of June,</date> which
he remited to this consulate. I herewith hand you a Copy of <persName>Mr.
Fisher</persName>s entire Letter to me, in which yours to him is embodied</p>

<p>In <persName>Mr. Fisher</persName>s letter to me of the <date when="1831-07-06">6 July</date> I am surprised to
find the following sentence "<persName>Free people of Colour</persName> are coming in
dayley into this <placeName>Country</placeName>, and you are much sensured on the subject??</p>

<p>Now I would like to know why sensure should be attached to me
for the commission of acts in which I can have no agency what ever,
on the receit of your officio, I published in the <placeName>dayly Gazett</placeName> of this
<placeName>City </placeName>that all <persName>free Negroes</persName> who had been driven out of <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>by
a law of the <persName>last Legislature</persName> were forbid en to enter the <placeName>States of
Cohahuila and Texas</placeName>, and all <persName>masters </persName>of Vessels were informed that
they would be compelled to bring away all such <persName>passengers </persName>they
might have on board their Vessels, which was doing all I could 
lawfully do to put a stop to such <persName>Emigrants</persName>, for I defy any man of that
discription to shew a passport from this consulate Since the date of
my publications.</p>

<p>If the <persName>authorities of Texas</persName> who have the power of preventing
those <persName>people </persName>being landed on their <placeName>shores</placeName>, or entering by land, will
not Exercise it, I am not to be blamed.   I have no power here as a<pb n="689"/>
<persName>Mexican Agent</persName> to prevent their going on board Vessels leaving this
<placeName>port</placeName>, then why not let the blame rest on the proper persons, Such
things are calculated to injure my Commercial business with <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
I hope therefore you will do me the Justice to correct the erronious
opinions of its being my fault</p>
