<p>Dear <persName>Austin</persName></p>

<p>I recd yours of the <date when="1823-07-09">9th July</date>, and am sorry to hear that things are
not so flourishing as we all had desired, I would willingly add my
assistance, but at this time I find it impossible without doing myself
more harm than I could possibly do the <placeName>colony </placeName>good I have now
determined to make a trip to <placeName>Orleans </placeName>in order to bring on medicines,
in which I shall need your friendship, I shall leave here with about
400 dollars which is about enough for my expenses, and depend 
entirely on a partnership or credit business in <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, in which case a
few lines from your hand to <persName>Mr. J. H. Hawkins</persName> would be of infinite
service, which you will probabily have an opportunity to send him
before I can arrive there&#8212;my whole object is <placeName>Texas</placeName>, but finding it
impossible to rais capital on credit for the enterprise I must make
use of every other industry to acquire that which will make me 
usefull to myself and <persName>friends </persName>when I go there. I am very impatient to
commence my <placeName>Hacienda </placeName>on the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, but do not like to begin
with my teeth and nails alone remember me to all the <persName>settlers</persName>, and
tell them that my heart and soul is with them and it is against my
will that my body is not also, but that when it goes I wish it to go
provided&#8212;one of my greatest pleasures is the anticipation of the
society of my old <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>countrymen </persName>in one of the most 
delightfull countries in the world, and most particularly of one, for the
sake of whose company one week at this time I would willingly put
myself on the diet of <hi rend="italic">catfish and wild onions without salt or greas</hi>,
again for a few days.</p>

<p>It is not worth the time to write me at this place as I shall set out
in a month if you write home let them know where I am&#8212;my 
respecte to your <persName>brother </persName>and all other <persName>friends </persName>and <persName>acquaintances</persName>&#8212;I
hope to be in <placeName>Orleans </placeName>in all the <date n="10-xx-1823">month of October</date></p>

<p><persName>R Andrews </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>[On cover:] In the absence of <persName>Mr. Austin</persName>, another friend may
open this letter</p>

<p><persName>Andrews</persName>.</p>
