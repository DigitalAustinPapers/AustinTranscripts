<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I Saw a letter from you to <persName>Mr E Bates</persName> written from <placeName>Labaddie
[La Bahia]</placeName> which gives an account of the <placeName>Country </placeName>you have been in
and your terms for <persName>Setlers</persName>. They appear liberal and verry 
Encouraging to <persName>emegrants</persName>. I have had Some Serious thoughs of 
removing to that Country but at this time I am So embarresed that it is
imposable for me to leave here without making a greater Sacrafice
than would be remunerated by a removal.</p>

<p>I wrote you previous to your departure from <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName> but
received no answer I then told you of the distress I was in at that
time which are Still growing worse. I hope you will answer this
and let me know what I have to depend on. The accounts you left
with <persName>Mr Asheley </persName>[at Little Rock] are little better than nothing they
will not be Collected for two or three years and I want the Money
immeadiately I am nearly ruined now for want of it. I offered your
Note this day for half of its amount and Could not get it. I hope
you will make an effort to relieve me if you Could Send me
groceries Iron or any kind of Southern articles I Could put them
upp to pay debts. If I had your deposition I Could recover it off
<persName>Harines</persName>( ?) Estate as he made the Contract after I had refused on my
part.   If you can do nothing for me please let me know what interest<pb n="428"/>
you will give me in your Colony for the debt if I Should Emigrate and what if I do not.</p>
<p><persName>William R Roberts</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed] : <persName>Stephen   F.   Austin   Esqr</persName>   <placeName>Louisiana   State   New
Orleans.</placeName></p>
