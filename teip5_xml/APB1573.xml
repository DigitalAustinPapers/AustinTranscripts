<p><placeName>Texas</placeName>, <date when="1828-07-24">July 24, 1828</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Sister</persName></p>

<p><persName>Lewis Morrison</persName> will hand you this, he has passed through the
<placeName>country</placeName>, tho [he] has not had an opportunity of seeing the best
part of it he can give you some account of the <placeName>country </placeName>etc&#8212;</p>

<p>I am likely to have a serious difficulty with <persName>Col. [Anthony] Butler</persName>
relative to the old business at the <placeName>Mines</placeName>&#8212; I fear that he is an 
unprincipled man&#8212;   I  wish you to get all the <placeName>Lead and account<pb n="77"/>
Books</placeName> of mine, for the year I worked the <placeName>mines </placeName>in <persName>partnership </persName>with
<persName>Butler</persName>, it was the last year I had his <persName>negros</persName>&#8212;we had them three
years in all, two years on hire and one year him and myself worked
the <placeName>mines </placeName>in <persName>partnership</persName>&#8212;there was nothing made of consequence
that year and I sent a full statement of the business of that season
to <persName>Butler</persName>, he has not produced it and seems to wish that I should
pay him five or six thousand dollars. I wish you to get the <placeName>Lead
Book</placeName> of that year and send [it] to me by <persName>Mr. Honey</persName> should he
come out next fall and <placeName>all the other Books of that years 
business</placeName>&#8212; I suppose they are with the other <placeName>Books of <persName>Father</persName>&#8212;</placeName> The <placeName>Lead
Book</placeName> is principally or all in <persName>Ballard</persName>s hand writing&#8212;</p>

<p>I hope <persName>John Austin</persName> paid you a visit and gave you an account of
the state of things here and some idea of the labor and difficulties
I have struggled through in settling this <placeName>wilderness </placeName>I have nothing
particular to write you&#8212; <persName>Brother </persName>and his <persName>wife </persName>are well, they are
down the <placeName>Brazos River</placeName> at this time <placeName>near the coast</placeName>. I saw them a
few days ago but we did not at that time know that <persName>Morrison </persName>would
start so soon which [is] the reason he did not write you&#8212; The
people here are generally healthy tho we have a severe drought,
the crops however are abundantly sufficient&#8212; We have general
peace and tranquility all over the <placeName>country </placeName>and the <placeName>settlements </placeName>are
progressing slowly but surely When I came here there was not
one civilized being <placeName>within two hundred miles of this colony </placeName>and
now I have near <persName>three thousand</persName> in it, and there are many large <placeName>farms</placeName>
and valuable improvements&#8212;but I am myself still poor as to 
disposable means&#8212;my object has been to settle the <placeName>country </placeName>more
than to speculate and the expenses I have had to undergo have more
than equalled what I have recd besides I have had some old debts to
pay off the amount of the <placeName>new Madrid</placeName> claims which I bought in
<placeName>St Louis</placeName> was over nine thousand dollars&#8212; I gave my notes for
them and let <persName>Bryan </persName>have them all&#8212;I never received any thing
from them and am still struggling along to pay for them also the
balance due <persName>Butler </persName>for the hire of his <persName>negros </persName>all fall on me and I
am working through that as fast as I can&#8212;</p>

<p>do not fail to collect all the <placeName>Books </placeName>I have written for and be
careful not to send them except by a <persName>safe hand</persName></p>

<p>Remember me to <persName>Mr Perry</persName> and all <persName>friends</persName></p>

<p>your brother</p>
<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>Send the enclosed to <persName>Mr Carr</persName> without delay</p>

<p>[Rubric]</p>

<p>Write me how political <persName>parties </persName>stand as regards <persName>Benton </persName>and <persName>Barton </persName>which of them stands highest, and which of them is supported<pb n="78"/>
by the <persName>Perrys </persName>and by <persName>Win C. Carr</persName> and <persName>Elias Bates</persName>&#8212;   I am myself
very much pleased with <persName>Bentons </persName>political course in the <persName>Senate</persName>&#8212;
I opened this after it was sealed</p>

<p>We have <persName>Isaac B Desha</persName> in irons here for murdering a man <placeName>on the
road between this and San Antonio</placeName>&#8212;his tryal is progressing, there
appears but little doubt of his guilt&#8212;</p>

<p>[Address:] <persName>Mrs Emiley A Perry</persName> <placeName>Potosí Missouri</placeName> pr <persName>Mr Lewis
Morrison
