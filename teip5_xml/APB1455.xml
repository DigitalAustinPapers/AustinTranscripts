<p><placeName>Hacienda de Carrizal</placeName>, the <date when="1827-09-08">8th 9ber 1827</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. Samuel W. Williams</persName>,</p>

<p>Dear Sir I have received your esteemed of the<date when="1827-09-10"> 10th of 
September</date> by the way of <persName>Mr. Ybarra </persName>and to which I answer albut 
immediately. I learn in it, that you are very busy, and that the <placeName>colony</placeName>
has sufered a good deal of feaver, and that you have wrote to your
<persName>friends </persName>for the seeds in question etc <persName>Colonel Austin</persName> is here, en
<placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, and has talked with <persName>Ybarra </persName>on the subject of the seeds, and
I too, I had three large conversations with him on the subject of my
former letters to him advising him that I had renounced my project
of going to the <placeName>brazos</placeName>, as a <persName>minister</persName>, etc he upon the whole, was very
satisfied with me. But he told me that he should be glad if I would
go thither to establish a <placeName>Spanish school,</placeName> that he had solicited a
<persName>Spanish Master </persName>for that purpose in the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and could obtain none,
that, at his arrival, he will try, (according to his wishes) to form a
<placeName>school</placeName>, to Justify a <persName>teacher</persName>, and he would write me the result, and
that in the meantime I would continue to write you both from time
to time. As he has told me that you take the <placeName>News paper called the
Eagle</placeName>, I shall tell you nothing of politics because you will see in<pb n="1710"/>
that paper all what is passing of interesting; altho I might advise
you to discontinue the subscription of that one to subscribe to <placeName>the
Sun</placeName> which is better and cheaper.</p>

<p>Since I have left <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>I was told by a good <persName>authority </persName>that the
<persName>Provisor </persName>has named a <persName>priest </persName>to go to yours parts, and the <persName>Colonel</persName>
told me he would go and see him on the subject.</p>

<p>This, Dear sir, is all what I can write worth of your notice, seing
that the <persName>Colonel </persName>will inform you of all and he will not difer his
return. in the meantime I remain your very respectfull and 
obedient servant</p>

<p><persName>Juan Francisco Buchetti</persName>.</p>

<p>N. B. if through leasure you oblige me to write me again Dirrect
me your letters through <persName>Mr Ybarra</persName> as you have done this last one</p>
<p><persName>J. F. B.</persName></p>
