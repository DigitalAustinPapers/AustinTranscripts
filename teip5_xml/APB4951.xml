<p><persName>Genl. Austin</persName></p>
<p>Dr. Sr</p>

<p><date when="1835-10-13">yesterday </date>I communicated to you as the <persName>commander of the detachment
at this place</persName> now I write as a <persName>private soldier</persName> from the time your order
came here to mantain the <placeName>post </placeName>at the risk of all hazzards—Their was shown
a disposition among the <persName>men </persName>to disobey the order—This <date when="1835-10-14">morning </date>an open
determination was shown to leave the place in consequence of which I 
resigned my command as did <persName>officers of the Columbia Company</persName>—I could
not do less your orders I am determined to obey even as a <persName>private</persName><pb n="183"/></p>

<p>The <persName>whole of the men</persName> have the greatest inclination to leave <placeName>this place</placeName>
many have upon more reflection promised still to stay untill you can be
heard from</p>

<p>The <persName>Company </persName>has been reorganized and the <persName>same officers</persName> reappointed—
some of the discontented will go on to you and I hope under the 
circumstances (the situation of the country) this departure from millitary duty
may [be] looked over</p>

<p>When I wrote <date when="1835-10-13">yesterday </date>it was my desire to have urged you to order on
immediately because I know <persName>Millitia </persName>could not be kept at <placeName>a post like this
</placeName>long at a time—and in this I was correct—take warning by this mishap
you are not upon a bed of roses—and if you are compeled to stay long at
a place; rely upon it, your <persName>men </persName>will desert you—There is nothing but their
honor to govern them—that is in many cases but a <hi rend="italic">cobweb</hi>— I know too
much of my duty to leave <placeName>this place</placeName> untill I here from you—I have 
prevaild upon <persName>many of the company</persName> to do so but I have but little confidence
that they can be quiet long without moving somewhare or other—What 
influence I may have shall be used to support you in your authority in all
that is just and proper—In this opinion I may be obtrusive but as one who
has much at stake I have a right to make such suggestions as may not be
offensive—Let me urge you to keep your men in motion—be careful in
your operations for I am persuaded you will have to contend for <placeName>Bexar </placeName>if
you get it— It is a last hope with <persName>Cos </persName>and if you should be defeated <placeName>Texas</placeName>
must suffer—and the <placeName>frontier </placeName>must <hi rend="italic">bleede </hi>freely for it—Let us be united
in our forces and make a bold push and all will be right—but a devission
of our little <persName>army </persName>may be ruinous to our cause</p>
