<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have just returned from <placeName>Nachitoches </placeName>the last news from <placeName>Europe</placeName>
is that <persName>Iterbede the late Emperor of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> has sailed from <placeName>Eng-<pb n="866"/>
land</placeName> in a private armed ship for <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName>, the account that he
published in <placeName>England </placeName>was that the <persName>people of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> had been 
continually sending for him to come and take charge of the 
<persName>Government </persName>as the <persName>Inhabitants </persName>was not capable of governing themselves
that his object was to go and render them all the assistance in his
power An <persName>officer in the United States army</persName> informed me that he
read an account in french from <placeName>Parris </placeName>which stated that he was
appoint[ed] by <persName>Ferdinando </persName>as <persName>Vice Roy of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> and was going
to take charge of the <placeName>Mexican provinces</placeName> for the <persName>Spanish 
Government</persName>, I give you the account as I heard it I do not answer for the
truth of it you must judge for yourself, the late report in 
circulation that the <placeName>United [States]</placeName> was going to get possession of the
<placeName>Province of Texas</placeName> I believe is unfounded <persName>Doctr Sibly</persName> informed me
that he wrote to <persName>Johnson, the Senator from Louisiana</persName> who informed
him that it was not thought of at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, as I was leaving
<placeName>Nachitoches </placeName><persName>Mr Hopkins</persName> arrived from <persName>New Orleans</persName> I went to see
him he informed me that <persName>Johnson </persName>had arrived at <placeName>Orleans </placeName>from
<placeName>Washington </placeName>that he Dined with him the day before he left town,
that the <persName>american Government</persName> has no Idea of holding the <placeName>Province
of Texas</placeName> The Committy in <persName>Congress </persName>have intirely acquited <persName>Mr.
Crawford</persName> of all the charges&#8212;brought against him by <persName>Governor 
Edwards</persName>. <persName>Edwards </persName>has resigned as <persName>Minister to <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> it is reported
that <persName>Cadwaller Golden of <placeName>New York</placeName></persName> is appointed by the <persName>President</persName>
but has declined going. A gentleman from <placeName>New York</placeName> is appointed
<persName>Consul for <placeName>Toluco</placeName></persName> and is gone for that place, five <persName>agents </persName>has 
arrived from <placeName>England </placeName>for <placeName>Mexico </placeName>the Congress immediately appointed
a <persName>Minister for the Court [of] <placeName>England</placeName></persName> who was to sail in eight
days for <placeName>England </placeName>in the Sloop of war that brought out the <persName>Agents</persName>-
excuse this scrawl Col. ... is waiting for it&#8212;</p>
