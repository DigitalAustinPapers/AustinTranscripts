<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I am happy to learn, by your Letter of the<date when="1807-07-18"> 18th Inst.</date> that you have
made so good a determenation&#8212; Carry it into complete effect and
unquestionably you will derive much satisfaction from it&#8212;You have
ample means to do these Things, in my Opinion, my Friend, nothing
should prevent me from doing it&#8212;It will close the mouths of many
complaining Persons&#8212;If you could form one other resolution and<pb n="131"/>
carry that also into effect, I think&#8212;your days in future, would pass
in peace and quietness&#8212;that is, under all circumstances and in all
situations do your duty and command yourself, if things work ever
so contrary and perverse, dont give way to your Passions, but make
the best of it&#8212;every thing can be effected by resolution&#8212;this mode
of conduct is the most satisfying you may depend&#8212;I know by 
experience&#8212;I write with the freedom of a <persName>friend</persName>, who feels a lively
interest in your welfare&#8212;I have recd. no order from you for <persName>Mr.
Perkins </persName>Lead, nor heard any thing before of one. Last Saturday <persName>Mr.
Burns</persName> presented one for 1000 lb. from <persName>Mr. Perkins</persName>, which was paid&#8212;
I had also taken some from his parcels thank fortune there was
enough left to pay <persName>Burns</persName>'s order&#8212;therefore if <persName>Perkins </persName>dont call
for what I have taken of his Lead, you may make yourself easy about
paying me at present&#8212;We will attend to sending you a barrel of
Salt as Soon as possible&#8212;<persName>Mr. Oliver</persName> and <persName>his Rib</persName> are snugly at 
housekeeping and appear happy and contented&#8212;I have no doubt will
experience the great difference between a matrimonial life and his
former mode of living&#8212;The papers you wish'd are inclosed&#8212;give
my best respects to your <persName>Family </persName>etc&#8212;<persName>Friends </persName>here all [well]</p>

<p><persName>T. Phelps.</persName></p>

<p>N. B. You have not yet given me your terms of rent&#8212;The <placeName>Store</placeName>
and <placeName>Cellar </placeName>separately and the rest of the <placeName>House</placeName>&#8212; If my <persName>Brother </persName>has
not already recd- the Lead due me from <persName>Mr. Pawley</persName> I wish you to
tell him to get away immediately I understand there is an execution
against him&#8212;</p>
