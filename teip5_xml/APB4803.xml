<p><persName>Mr. B. Durbin</persName> goes to <placeName>Sanfelepe </placeName>to pay the fees&#8212;on <placeName>a quarter League
No-3&#8212;above <persName>Smithes </persName>on Navidad</placeName>&#8212; I&#8212;have directed him to you for
informatition, and to pay the whole amount of the States fees&#8212;to you if
you will recieve them&#8212;. from the deed I make out that the first payment
will not be due till <date when="1835-06-12">6th December Next</date>&#8212;but I want <persName>Mr. Durbin </persName>to pay
all the state fees&#8212;now.</p>

<p>please write me all the news&#8212;say what you know about <persName>Austin</persName>,
<persName>Williams</persName>, etc. etc. And what is going on in the <placeName>Interior</placeName>.</p>

<p>We have news here that <persName>Colo Austin</persName> is at Liberty, and will probably be
in <placeName>Monclova </placeName>on the <date when="1835-05-20">20th- this Mo</date>.&#8212; That <persName>Genl Santana</persName> has taken
<placeName>Zacatecas</placeName>. <persName>700&#8212;Killd-</persName> and he took <persName>2700 prisoners</persName>&#8212;then turned on his
heel and went <placeName>toward to the South</placeName>&#8212;to put <hi rend="italic">down <persName>Genl Albares</persName></hi> and <hi rend="italic">Libertey</hi>
in that Section. We understand that <persName>Genl. Cos</persName>&#8212;has sent a copy of a
proclamation to all the <persName>Ayuntementos in <placeName>texas</placeName></persName>&#8212;in which he says "there
is certain designing <persName>foreigners </persName>in <placeName>Monclova </placeName>exciting and creating rebellion
and Insulting the <placeName>Sovreign Nation</placeName>" etc. etc.</p>

<p>The Sale of <placeName>650 Leagues of Land</placeName> by the State has caused much
excitement in these <placeName>Settlements</placeName>&#8212;so far as I have heard the <persName>people </persName>are not
willing to stand the pull If there was any way to help it&#8212;. What do
you believe <persName>Santana</persName>'s Intentions are? I have Just received a new Land
Law, dated <date when="1835-05-02">2d may&#8212;(past)</date>&#8212;It provides for all who are Now in <placeName>texas</placeName>
and who have not got any to recieve land acording to the Law of <date when="1825-03-24">24-march
1825</date>&#8212;, by way of a <persName>commissioner Genl</persName> one for <persName>Each department of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
</persName>Shall be appointed, and those who come to the country Since&#8212;<date n="05-xx-1832">May 1832</date>&#8212;
shall pay to the State 60-$ on a <placeName>sitio of pasture</placeName>, and five Dollars on each
<placeName>Labore of Arable Land</placeName>. I Leave home to day on a surveying tour in
<placeName>deleon's Colony</placeName>, and shall be gone- 4&#8212;or 5 week&#8212;. There has been a
great many more applications for Land in that <placeName>Colony </placeName>than the contract
calld for&#8212;his time was out <date when="1835-04-29">29th of April</date>&#8212;but he has time granted to
have the Surveys, an titles made&#8212;</p>

<p>There has been more than 50&#8212;<persName>applicants </persName>since the contract was filld
who of course could not be recieved</p>

<p><persName>Colo Dewitt</persName> Died some time ago in <placeName>Monclova</placeName>.</p>
