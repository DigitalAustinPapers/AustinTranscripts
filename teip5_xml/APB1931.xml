            <p><add hand="#barker">Arguing fidelity of Texans, injustice of law of April 6, interpretation that exempts his contracts from its operation.</add></p>
        </div1>
        <div1 type="body">
            

<p>I beg permission to call the attention of your E for a moment to
a subject of deep interest to the prosperity of <placeName>Texas </placeName>hoping that
the purity of my intentions (which have no other object than to
discharge my duty faithfully as a<persName> M[exican] C[itizen]</persName>) will serve
as my apology.</p>

<p>It is doubtless well known to <persName>Y. E.</persName> that I was the first <persName>emp°</persName> who
undertook to form a <placeName>settlement </placeName>in the <placeName>wilderness of Texas,</placeName> that I
have devoted all my time and personal attention to this object since<pb n="383"/>
the year <date n="xx-xx-1821">1821.</date> That I have succeeded fully in redeeming a 
considerable <placeName>portion of this country</placeName> from the State of nature overrun
with <persName>savages </persName>in which I found it, and that I have laid a <placeName>foundation</placeName>
for the permanent advancement and prosperity of <placeName>Texas </placeName>by 
rendering it easy to form new <placeName>settlements </placeName>in consequence of the resources
which may be drawn from my <placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212;Perhaps it may be necessary
for me to declare that my objects in coming to <placeName>Texas </placeName>were pure, that
I have never had any others, and that my maxim always has been
and now is fidelity and gratitude to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. There appears to be
something humiliating in the idea that there should ever seem to
be any necessity for such a declaration as this on my part, for I
hoped that my conduct and deportment ever since I entered <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
as well as the conduct of the <persName>settlers </persName>in my <placeName>colony </placeName>would have been
sufficient to screen us from suspicion or jealousies, I know not 
however whether it has been sufficient or not, for I have seen the <persName>Mexican</persName>
prints filled with reflections, which indicate but little confidence in
the <persName>new settlers</persName>. Such reflections are unjust and unmerited&#8212;they
are also impolitic, for they are well calculated to create discontent
and disgust where it never has existed. The true policy of this Gvt.
evidently is to make <placeName>Texas </placeName>a <hi rend="italic">usefull</hi> and <hi rend="italic">productive</hi> <placeName>part of the nation</placeName>
to which it belongs&#8212; under this idea and with this object in view I
have been laboring for eight years past. It has been a prominent
point of policy with me in managing the <persName>new settlers</persName> and in forming
their ideas and opinions as to the future, to impress upon them the
belief that it is more to their <hi rend="italic">interest </hi>to remain for ever United to
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>, than to any other nation on earth&#8212;it would be occupying too
much of your time to state the arguments which I have used to 
inforce this opinion and will therefore only say that they were fully
successful, and I do most positively assert the fact that all the 
reflecting part of the <persName>settlers </persName>would oppose a change could they have
hope of seeing the govt settled on a basis which offerd permanency
and tranquility; Mankind are generally influenced by their interests,
and it requires but a superficial examination to prove that the 
commercial and agricultural interests of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, will be more effectually
promoted by remaining under this Gvt than under any other&#8212;
besides this all powerfull ligament there is another, which I can with
equal certainty declare is in the highest degree binding in these
<persName>settlers</persName>, which is <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi>, a sence of the moral obligations which
their oaths impose upon them as <persName>men </persName>of honor and as <persName>christians</persName>&#8212;
They became <persName>Mexicans </persName>from choice they have been faithfull to this
<persName>Govt </persName>since they entered its <placeName>territory</placeName>, they wish to remain <persName>Mexicans</persName>,
and it is their interests as well as their duty to remain&#8212;under this
view of the subject is it good policy to sour their minds and alienate
their affections?<pb n="384"/></p>

<p>The law of the<date when="1830-04-06"> 6 of April</date> will have a fatal tendency if imprudently
executed as you can easily perceive by taking a slight view of my
<placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212; I have made arrangements by means of contracts entered
into by myself personally and by means of my <persName>agents </persName>to settle all the
<persName>families </persName>which I have engaged to settle, and I believe that they have
all arranged their affairs to remove the coming <date n="Fall - 1830">fall </date>and <date n="Winter - 1830">winter </date>and
<date n="Spring - 1831">spring </date>and are now<placeName> on the road</placeName> They are from<placeName> N. Y.</placeName> and the <placeName>States
from there to Louisiana</placeName>&#8212; Many of them are <persName>persons of capital</persName> and
all of them have property or lands or other effects to sell before they
could remove, It is very evident that they require time to make
their preparations, to sell their property and convert it into money
and arrange their affairs for a final and permanent removal to a
<placeName>foreign and distant land</placeName>&#8212; it is also evident that they had to make
some preparations here for the reception of their <persName>families</persName>&#8212;and such
is the fact with respect to the <persName>settlers </persName>who have contracted to emigrate
to my <placeName>Colony </placeName>the ensuing <date n="Fall - 1830">fall </date>and <date n="Winter - 1830">winter </date>and <date n="Spring - 1831">spring</date>&#8212; They have
sold their property where they lived and made the necessary 
arrangements for a removal. They in [fact] properly belong to the <placeName>colony</placeName>
and have the [same] right to come to it, which those who are [now]
here have to stay, and to prevent them would be a direct violation of
the law and of public faith, and could not be viewd otherwise by the
intelligent world&#8212; under this view of the subject and considering
that the 10 article of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6 April</date> gives all such <persName>emigrants </persName>a
right even under that prohibitory law to enter this <placeName>territory </placeName>I have
informed them, that the <persName>emigrants </persName>to my <placeName>colony </placeName>are not included in
the prohibition contained in the 11 article for my <placeName>colony </placeName>is " 
<hi rend="italic">established </hi>" and consequently no variation is to be made in it&#8212; This is
consistent with the law and it was due to justice, and was more
especially necessary to shield the character and public faith of this
<persName>Govt </persName>from the odium which must of necessity have been cast upon it,
if these <persName>families </persName>were not allowed to enter, for it would have ruined
the most or all of them, immagine for a moment the situation in
which some hundreds of <persName>families </persName>had to be placed, by being stopped
<placeName>on the road to this colony</placeName> after having sold all their property <placeName>where
they formerly lived</placeName> and incurred heavy expences, they would be
totally ruined, and the odium would of necessity fall on the <persName>Govt</persName>
that caused their ruin&#8212;public sympathy would be excited to a very
high degree and public indignation would immediately follow,&#8212;The
<persName>settlers </persName>whom I allow to [enter] are of the <persName>best class</persName>, whether 
considered with respect to their property, their morals or their 
intelligence&#8212;and the acquisition of that <persName>population </persName>would do more towards
uniting <placeName>Texas </placeName>to <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and securing good order and tranquility
than any measure that could be adopted. I have been informed that
the   <persName>commandant   at   <placeName>Nacodoches</placeName></persName>   will   enterpose   difficulties   on<pb n="385"/>
<persName>[emig] rants</persName> to my <placeName>colony</placeName>, in order [to avo]id this I must beg that
<persName>Y. E.</persName> will take this matter into consideration and procure from his
<persName>E. the vice president</persName> the necessary instruction to the <persName>Comd Genl of
this section</persName> not to stop the <persName>emigrants </persName>to my <placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The most of the contracts on colonization will expire in <date n="04-xx-1831">April
next</date>, my <placeName>colony </placeName>and <placeName>Dewitts </placeName>are the only ones that have progressed
and mine is the only one that can be said to be " established " None
of the [other] <placeName>colonies </placeName>are in the situation that mine is for none of
them have progressed <placeName><persName>Dewitt</persName>s</placeName> has been commenced and he has over
one hundred <persName>settlers</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>with regard to the admission of slavery in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, I have to say
that I have always been opposed from principle to slavery and that
I am well satisfied with the prohibitory laws on that subject. I
have advocated the toleration of slavery here in the infancy of 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>because I at one time totally dispaired of getting <persName>emigrants</persName>
without allowing them to bring <persName>slaves </persName>The <placeName>country </placeName>is now 
sufficiently advanced and as far as my influence extends I shall forever
oppose slavery in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; I have made this declaratory to the
<persName>settlers </persName>in public manner and my opinions relative to this matter
are well known.</p>

<p>I beg leave to refer <persName>Y. E</persName>. to<persName> Dn Ramon Musquiz chief of the Dept
of <placeName>Bexar </placeName></persName>,to <persName>Govr Jose Ma Viesca</persName>, to<persName> Genl Teran</persName> and to his Ey The
<persName>vice President</persName> of the <placeName>nation </placeName>for information as to my character and
conduct&#8212;with the highest respect etc</p>
