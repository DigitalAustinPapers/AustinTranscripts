<p><persName>Hon. T. H. Benton</persName></p>

<p>Dr Sir,</p>

<p><persName>Mr Wharton</persName> returns to <placeName>Washington </placeName>as the <persName>Minister plenipotentiary of
this <placeName>Republic</placeName></persName>&#8212; The main object of his mission is the <hi rend="italic">annexation </hi>of this
<placeName>country </placeName>to the <placeName>U.S.</placeName>&#8212; The <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> expressed their wish for this
measure at the general election in <date n="09-xx-1836">September</date>&#8212;only <hi rend="italic">ninety three</hi> voting in
the negative in all <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and about 40 of them were persons who had just
come to the <placeName>country </placeName>from the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> and had not any permanent interests
here&#8212; This vote has resulted from the warm attachment of this <persName>people </persName>to
the <placeName>country </placeName>and <persName>govt</persName>, of their nativity, and their full confidence in the
liberality and even munificence of that <persName>Govt</persName>, as relates to the terms or
conditions of annexation</p>

<p>Our basis is an equitable reciprocity, keeping in view the claims of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
upon the toils and sufferings of years in redeeming this <placeName>country </placeName>from the
<placeName>wilderness</placeName>, and achieving its independence&#8212; We took up arms against
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>to secure the right of self Govt. We consider that we have secured
that right, and consequently expect to retain it as a state when annexed to
the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> The <persName>population of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> is sufficient to become a state under the
constitution and laws of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and it is therefore confidently expected
that no objections will be made to going into a <persName>state Govt</persName>, without passing
through the intermediate stage of a <persName>territorial Govt.</persName>&#8212; I cannot see that
any objection can be made to this course The <persName>officers in office</persName> and laws of
this <placeName>Republic </placeName>in force at the time of the ratification should continue untill
the state constitution was formed and the <persName>state Govt</persName>, organized Supposing
that the treaty of annexation should be ratified by <date n="Spring-1837">next spring</date>&#8212;Military
possession would be immediately taken by the <placeName>U. S.</placeName>&#8212; The <persName>civil govt,</persName>
would go on as organized at that time&#8212;A convention would meet and form
the state constitution so as to present it to the <persName>next congress of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName></persName>
for approval&#8212;there would be no interregnum no sudden changes of 
<persName>officers </persName>etc There will in fact be only a change of name and we shall avoid
all the confusion, and perhaps I should say, degradation, of descending
from a <placeName>Free Republic</placeName>, to a <placeName>dependent Territory</placeName>, before we can be a <placeName>State</placeName>.</p>

<p>As to the future subdivision of <placeName>Texas </placeName>into a <placeName>plurality of states</placeName> or 
<placeName>territories</placeName>&#8212;equity evidently requires that it should be left intirely and 
exclusively to the option and decision of the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName></p>

<p>I do not anticipate any difficulty as to the terms of annexation&#8212;we 
expect nothing unreasonable, and have full confidence that what is equitable
will be granted.<pb n="456"/></p>

<p>I must solicit your support in this matter and that you will extend to
<persName>Mr. Wharton</persName> such aid as may be proper</p>

<p><persName>S. F. A</persName></p>
