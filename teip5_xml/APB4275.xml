<p><date when="1831-11-14">November 14, 1831</date></p>
<p>My dear <persName>Cousin</persName></p>

<p>I received yours of <date when="1831-11-02">2nd instant</date> this day, and am barely able to
acknowledge its receipt. I have been very ill, and am not yet able
to leave my room, and can only set up ten or fifteen minutes at a
time.</p>

<p>I like the idea of a <hi rend="italic">notice of this <placeName>country</placeName></hi> that will make it better
known. I believe the time has now come for such a thing. <hi rend="italic">The
opposite to this, however, has been my policy, until a year or so
past.</hi> This I can better explain verbally. I should have replied
to the queries of the "<persName>London Geographical Society</persName>" had I not
been in bed for forty five days.</p>

<p>There is <placeName>no vacant land below Brazoria</placeName> so that you cannot get
your <placeName>league </placeName>there. I have a place for that location in view <placeName>near
Galveston Bay</placeName> which is as good as any now to be had.</p>

<p>As to my <placeName>premium land</placeName> and private affairs, you will be much
surprised to learn exactly how they stand; and will feel much 
inclined to say that I have been a faithful servant to all the <persName>colonists</persName>
except one; that one is&#8212;<persName>Stephen F Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>All the <placeName><hi rend="italic">premium land</hi></placeName> I hold <placeName>around and below Brazoria</placeName> is in
<hi rend="italic">partnership </hi>with the <persName>heirs of my old friend, Joseph Hawkins Esq:
</persName>and so entangled that I, myself, know not what to do with it. But,
if I enter on this matter <hi rend="italic">now </hi>I shall worry myself.</p>

<p>I must apprize you of one thing that you may not be too much
disturbed when you notice it. The mass of the <persName>Colonists </persName>look on
<persName>all relations of mine </persName>who come here with envy and suspicion and
great jealousy. The reason is this. They <hi rend="italic">suspect </hi>that something
more will be done for <hi rend="italic">them </hi>than for those who <hi rend="italic">" bore the brunt of
the battle "</hi></p>

<p>I fear (judging by my own experience) that the predominant
traits in the<persName> North American</persName> character are ingratitude, selfishness,
and avarice. The<persName> people of this Colony </persName>have caused (what I had
formerly said was impossible) a shade of misanthropy to pass over
me. I do not say that it <hi rend="italic">dwells </hi>in my mind, long at a time. But to
know ourselves is a difficult task, if not impossible, and perhaps it
is a more settled conviction than I allow. Would that it were but
the airy nothing of a fevered brain.</p>

<p><persName>Gen. Terran</persName> has arrived at <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">positive&#8212; I must see him;</hi>
and shall leave here in a carriage for that purpose, in a few days,
if able to do so.   I do not see that we can meet until I return from<pb n="702"/>
the visit to <persName>Terran</persName>.   It will be short.   I will then go to see you at
<placeName>Bolivar</placeName>.</p>

<p>I must stop, for this effort has cost me all my strength. I have
a letter from your <persName>brother, John P Austin</persName>, by " the Boston " in at
<placeName>Matagorda</placeName>, dated<date when="1831-10-11"> Oct: 11.</date> He says the "Nelson", with <persName>Henry's
family </persName>was to sail the <date when="1831-10-20">20th October</date>, <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>.</p>

<p>Farewell: I am truly anxious to see you. Think well <hi rend="italic">all about
this <placeName>country </placeName></hi>before you finally remove, so as to be fully contented
afterwards.</p>

<p><persName>S F Austin.</persName></p>
