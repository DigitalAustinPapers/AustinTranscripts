from you fore months has elapsed since I received your last I have
been feerful you were sick you have gone through so much fatigue
and hardship since you left home, may the God of truth arrest
you[r] attention and bring you to feal the necessity of working out
your solles salvation I must now begin to tell you of the 
reffermation in <placeName>Zains Ville</placeName> since you left home I will commence at<persName> sister
Brook</persName>s family in the first place <persName>D Brooke</persName> joind the <persName>methodist
Church</persName> in a few weeks after he embrased religion his <persName>father </persName>two
<persName>sister </persName>with myself joind the same, I have reason to rejoice in the
lord for what he has done for my immortal part he has brought
me to see the errow of my weys and turned my back upon sin and
folly to the living god. when I look back upon my past life and
see how many of my preacious hours I have spent in sin I wonder
that I have not been cut down as a cumberer of the ground, let me
impress upon your mind how nessary, how important it is to be
preparred for that awful messenger, death, which awaits all the
children of men sooner or later, O my dear let us join heart and hand
in praising the lord for his mercy induretb for ever for he has
promised the righteous shall never [be ] forsaken nor their seed 
begging bread, has he not been knocking at the door of you heart until
his locks has been wet with the dew I keep him out no longer open
now your heart and let him in and sup with him you with him,
do not as felix did say go thy way and at a more convenient
season I will call for thee now is the acceptable time behold now is
the day of salvation O my Dear do not be over ancios about much
of this worrlds goods it is but little we want and that little but a
little while, may we live a life that when we come to leave this
world that we may rejoice in the god of our salvation, and if we are
not prepared what an awful thing it will be to here that sentance<pb n="485"/>
pronounced depart ye workers of inquity for I no you not, O my
Dear my whole sole is drawn out for you do not refuse to come
where there is so much felicity awaits you because pressed to by a
person who is unworthy to bring you the invitation we have passed
many years beneath the same roof we have born the same fatigues
and tasted the same pleasures, why then should we be sepperated
now, why should they be devided who by nature habit and 
friendship have been so long united I have undertaking a journey to the
new jerrusalem Suffer me not to go alone thither let neather the
fatigue nor the lenghth of the wey affright you we shall be provided
for ever with the heavenly manna and streems of living water god
himself shall go before us in a piller of fire and under the 
protection of his wings we may walk without fear through the valley and
shadow of death, come then my dear I am most unwilling to leave
you behind come support me go before me in courage and show me
the wright wey I feel the want of a faithful companion and a 
cristain friend suffer me to throw myself at you feet to imbrace youfr]
knees and wash your feet with the tears that is streeming from my
eyes I ask no part of temporal possession only enough to live on but
I intreet you to seek an internal [sic] inheritance, I seek neather
gold nor silver but I am ancios you should share my joys I am
solicitious that you should accompany me to mount sion to the sitty
of the living god that you should mix in the innumerable company
of angels who are placed in the church of the first Born I am ancious
therefore that you should come and have your name written in the
lam[b's] book of life.</p>
