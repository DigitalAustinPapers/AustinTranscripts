<p>[From the Williams Papers. Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas.]</p>
<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1835-09-22">Augt 22d 1835</date></p>
<p>Since you left I have heard, by way of <placeName>Natchitoches</placeName>, that matters are
getting on pritty well, in our <placeName>country</placeName>, considerable excitement tho. not
more than might be reasonably expected under the circumstances of the
times&#8212; Everything depends on a great emigration this <date n="Fall-1835">fall </date>and <date n="Winter-1835">winter</date>&#8212;
remember this&#8212; The <persName><placeName>New York</placeName> folks </persName>have much at stake, and ought to
exert themselves to send out <persName>families </persName>without delay&#8212; their best plan is to
send an <persName>agent</persName>, or to operate by means of<persName> influential men</persName> in the <placeName>Western
Country</placeName>&#8212; The plan of sending out <persName>irish </persName>or <persName>german redemtioners</persName> is a
bad one&#8212;it will not do&#8212; you know the kind of <persName>settlers </persName>needed in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; We need efficient and <persName>active and intelligent men</persName> who will take
character and means to the <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212; Much, and perhaps all, may depend
on the emigration this <date n="Fall-1835">fall </date>and <date n="Winter-1835">winter</date>&#8212;<pb n="105"/></p>

<p>I wish to take a large interest in the <placeName>bank</placeName>, as I told you&#8212; This we will
arrange when you return&#8212; Keep in view that that measure cannot succeed
well unless many of the <persName>farmers </persName>etc in <placeName>Texas </placeName>are interested&#8212; Do not
fail to call on <persName>Mr. Learning</persName>, and my <persName>friends </persName>in <placeName>N. York</placeName>, and be very
prudent as to everything. The vessel goes tomorrow&#8212; remember me to
<persName>White</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. A.</persName></p>

<p>I was told confidentially to day that a letter had been written to <placeName>Texas</placeName>
from here (I know not by whom but guess) stating that I was a blind
<persName>agent of Santana</persName>'s etc. The object of certain persons, as you know, is to
try and make tools of the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> to build up themselves&#8212; <placeName>Texas</placeName>
ought to act on the defensive and not be the tools of either of the <persName>political
parties of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName>&#8212; She has just as much to expect from one <persName>party</persName>, as
from the other, and no more from one than from the other&#8212; She must
rely upon herself, and to do so, she needs strength&#8212; emigration gives us
strength and everything.</p>
