<p>Dr Sir <date when="1830-04-14">Tomorrow </date>I leave for <placeName>Tampico </placeName>if I receive the papers
<persName>Mr Williams</persName> did not send them and we have been obliged to send
an <persName>express </persName>to <placeName>San Felipe</placeName> for them. I expect to return here as soon
as I can dispose of the Cargo if should not sell the Vessel in case
I sell her I will go to <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>. I am in hopes the trip will turn
out well. <persName>Abner Harris</persName> was here a few days since I gave him
<persName>McNeil</persName>s note he will get the Cattle in a few days from them I also
instructed him to sell all the horses and mares at the <placeName>Gin </placeName>for Cattle
if he could I think Cattle much more profitable than horses in this
<placeName>flat country</placeName>&#8212;   <persName>Harris </persName>has made the following propositions about<pb n="369"/>
staying at the <placeName>Gin </placeName>and wishes you to write the contract and send
him a copy, to wit if there is less than 100 head cows one third of
the increase for his part over 100 and less than 200 one fourth 200
and upwards one fifth, for the horses one half the increase&#8212;the
Hogs one half the increase&#8212;the improvement to be left in good
repair he wishes nothing said about the <placeName>Gin house</placeName> as there is no
prospect for much business at it, he is willing to take care of it
etc if you think that proposition will do send him a copy of it as
soon as convenient if the horses could be disposed of for Cattle
I think it will do, <persName>Harris </persName>is a steady man and I think it better
to keep him there you can get the Cattle Say upwards of 200
head it will be an object to him and a handsome income to you.
I wish you would send <persName>Williams </persName>or some person to appraise the
<placeName>property </placeName>there as soon as possible as delay will make it more 
difficult   <persName>Harris </persName>will shew the Stock any time</p>
