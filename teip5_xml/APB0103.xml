<p>Dear Sr.</p>

<p>Your Note is rec'd by <persName>little John</persName>. This is not a moment to speek
of reason since reason appears Not to be the Order of the Day. You
say that the <persName>Officers of the Battalion</persName> are determin'd to take the piece
of Ordenance by force Unless Other wise given Up. I have been in
possession of this <placeName>peice of Ordenanc</placeName>e five years. It was brought to
this place at my Expence. at my expence put in Order. I am 
Accountable for the peice when called on by proper Authority. I now
ask you by what Authority the <persName>officers of this place</persName> call on me to
give it up they may as well demand any part of my property as the
Cannon and say I insult them by not not giving it up to them.</p>

<p>I have commemorated this Day Twenty years and many times
at my <placeName>House</placeName>, pray Sr is it in this I have insult'd them If an 
Insult has been given they are the men that have give the Insult</p>

<p>I am always dispos'd to meet my fellow men on friendly terms
to arrange misunderstandings with temper and reason but <persName>Mr Henry
</persName>do you Expect I am to be forced into measures No Sr. I now tell you
that If my <placeName>House </placeName>is forced by <persName>armed men</persName> so be It, I can only stand
on the Defensive.</p>

<p>You are pleas'd to say you are this Day A Soldier but doth that
take from you your Authority as a <persName>peace officer</persName>   I think not and<pb n="110"/>
my Dear Sr. Remember you must be Accountable for this Day[s]
outrage If any is Offered to me or my property</p>

<p>Reason is and shall alway[s]  be my guied and on Reasonable
terms only am I to be   Your, 0[bedient Servant.]</p>

<p>[Moses Austin.]</p>

<p>[To Major Andrew Henry.]</p>
