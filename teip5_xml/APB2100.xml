<p>Sir</p>

<p>As <persName>Executor of the will of David Richmond</persName> deceased I have to
demand once more from you the Deed of said <persName>Richmond</persName>s land
Lodged with you by <persName>Mr Byrd</persName> for the express purpose of 
transmitting the same to me which you promised him to do but which promise
you never fulfilled</p>

<p>When I formerly called upon you for the Deed you stated to me
that you had sent the same to <persName>Col Austin </persName>and that you were totally
unacquainted with the manner in which <persName>Judge Austin</persName> had acquired
information of the same being in your hands&#8212;Upon a subsequent
application to <persName>Judge Austin </persName>he informed me that You by letter
had informed him that <persName>Richmond</persName>s Deed was in your possession and
that in consequence of such informatn he had wrote to you first&#8212;
This Sir is not fair or honest dealing</p>

<p>Upon mature reflection and a review of the whole transaction,
Considering the special purpose for which this Deed was Entrusted
to you&#8212;Your breach of Confidence And the falsehood above stated
with which you attempted to justify your Conduct I feel myself
alsolutely bound as the <persName>guardian of Richmonds property</persName> to require
you now without <hi rend="italic">equivocation or delay</hi> to restore or cause to be
restored to me the Deed in question&#8212;<persName>Capt Martin</persName> a Gentleman of
standing and respectability will deliver this Communication to
you&#8212;He is hereby fully Authorized to receive the Deed and receipt&#8212;
to you for the same Or in case of your declining to do so He is
empowered to make other Arrangements which he will in such case
Communicate to you&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Lauce Rich. Kenny </persName>   [Rubric]</p>
