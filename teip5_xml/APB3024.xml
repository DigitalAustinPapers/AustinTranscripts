<p>Dr Sister</p>

<p>I am happy to hear by your letter to <persName>Brother</persName> that you have a fine
<persName>son</persName>, and thank you and <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> for giving him the name of
Stephen after me You are likely to prove the truth of the <persName>old fortune teller</persName> who told you in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> that you was to have nine
children. A new <placeName>country </placeName>would suit such a family, tho I can not take
it uppon myself to advise you to move to this&#8212;<persName>Mr Perry</persName> must come
when he has leisure and look for himself&#8212;we have had rather a bad
year owing to wet weather but our crops are very abundant corn
I think will not be over one Dollar in cash pr bushel, except in a few
particular places&#8212;the Sickness has not been as bad as it is through
the <placeName>southern country</placeName> generally</p>

<p>I am about making arrangements to settle <persName>brother</persName> <placeName>a farm down
the Brasos</placeName> he has not much to begin with, but industry will push
him ahead&#8212;I hope to see him married before another year&#8212;as for
myself&#8212;it is very uncertain when I shall settle myself in that way&#8212;
if ever   I am too much in debt and my affairs too unsettled as yet&#8212;</p>

<p>I wrote you respecting the <placeName>Mine a Burton</placeName> and <placeName>Little Rock</placeName> business
a short time ago&#8212;<persName>Brother</persName> and myself will give any <persName>Power of Attorney</persName> that may be required except to authorise the promise of money
I will not in any shape promise one cent of money on no account
whatever and unless there is a special provision in the <persName>Power of
Attorney</persName> that we are not to be in any way responsible for costs or
fees or money to pay the <persName>Bank </persName>or for any thing else I will not sign
it&#8212;I am willing to give any share&#8212;the half&#8212;or any other share you
think proper but those who undertake the business must be at all
the expence and trouble for I cannot leave here to visit <placeName>Missouri</placeName></p>

<p>I do not by any means advise you to Employ <persName>R. C. Oden</persName> to attend
to the <placeName>Little Rock</placeName> business&#8212;he is very dissipated as I am told&#8212;
<persName>R. Crittenden</persName> will be the best one, or perhaps there may be some new
<persName>Lawyers </persName>that I know nothing of-&#8212;you and <persName>Mr. Perry</persName> must manage<pb n="1229"/>
the whole affair as you think best.   I will approve of all you do
except promising money&#8212;that I will not&#8212;</p>

<p>This <placeName>Colony</placeName> progresses steadily in improvement&#8212;-tho not so rapidly as it would had the last season been more favourable It requires
much time to start a <placeName>new Colony in a wilderness</placeName>, as this was I shall
close all my affairs in the course of next year I hope, and then if I
keep my senses I will never again have any thing to do with public
business&#8212;if I marry I shall settle down as a <persName>farmer </persName><placeName>near the mouth
of this river</placeName>&#8212;if I do not, I shall likely ramble a good deal and leave
<persName>Brother</persName> to keep up the name and family</p>

<p>Remember me to all <persName>friends </persName>and do not let the <persName>children</persName> forget
their <persName>uncle </persName>when my little namesake is old enough I hope to have it
in my power to do something for him, I should also like to have
<persName>Austin</persName> with me&#8212;that is if I ever get finally settled and in a situation to benefit him&#8212;we are all very healthy at this time and nothing
new of any consequence</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mrs Emily M. Perry</persName> <placeName>Potosi Washington County
Missouri</placeName></p>
