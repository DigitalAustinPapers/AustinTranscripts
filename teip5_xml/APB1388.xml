<p>My Dr <persName>Sister</persName>.</p>

<p>A considerable period has elapsed since I had the pleasure of
receiving a letter from my dear <persName>Emily</persName>&#8212;Can an absence of only a
few years, entirely have obliterated from her memory a <persName>Brother</persName>
she onced loved! What can be the cause of her long silence ? 
perhaps she is so much engaged in her <hi rend="italic">domestic </hi>duties that she cannot
"<hi rend="italic">steal</hi>" time to devote a few <hi rend="italic">leisure </hi>moments to her <hi rend="italic"><persName>Brown</persName></hi>, 
Excuse me <persName>sister </persName><hi rend="italic">for </hi>reproaching you for your negligence for I <hi rend="italic">assure</hi>
you I have been much <hi rend="italic">hurt </hi>at your long silence. You perhaps think
I am hardly justifiable, in blaming you for a fault you think I
am equally <hi rend="italic">censurable </hi>for but on this point I can satisfy you&#8212;For
the last year I have been absent from the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;and in a <placeName>country</placeName>
where there was no mode of conveying a letter to the <placeName>U. S</placeName>&#8212;Shortly
after my arrival I wrote you from <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, and since then I
have been anxiously expecting a letter from you&#8212;</p>

<p>You have no doubt heard long since, the happy termination of
the disturbances on this <placeName>frontier </placeName>and the conspicuous part Our
<persName>Brother </persName>acted in bringing to a close so unnatural rebellion&#8212;At this
time the utmost harmony prevails in every part of this <placeName>country</placeName>, and
<hi rend="italic">so far</hi> we are blessed with a prospect of a plentiful harvest in a
healthy season,</p>

<p>We are not entirely forgotten by our <persName>friends </persName><placeName>in the north</placeName> a few
days since we received a lenthy letter from <persName>Henry Austin</persName> dated
in <hi rend="italic"><placeName>New York</placeName></hi>&#8212;<persName>Stephen </persName>has answered it and recommen[d]ed him to
come and see the <placeName>Country </placeName>and I think he will be out in the fall&#8212;
My sole wish is to see our scattered <persName>family </persName>once more United and
I think there is some little prospect of their being so provided
<persName>Henry </persName>is pleased with the <placeName>Country</placeName></p>

<p>I have nothing new to communicate&#8212;we have a prospect of a
considerable emigration <hi rend="italic">from <placeName>Ohio</placeName></hi> <date n="Fall - 1827">next fall</date>&#8212;<pb n="1645"/></p>

<p>Our State constitution is to be published in this place on the <date when="1827-05-29">29th</date>.
inst it is an excellent one&#8212;no <persName>slaves </persName>are permitted to be 
introduced <date when="1827-11-29">6 months after its publication</date>, which will give until the <date when="1827-11-29">29th
of next November</date> to introduce them&#8212;No person can be born a
<persName>slave </persName>in this <placeName>State </placeName>after the publication of the Constitution. If
there are any <persName>persons </persName>in your part of the <placeName>Country </placeName>having <hi rend="italic"><persName>Slaves</persName></hi>,
that wish to remove here&#8212;<hi rend="italic">hurry </hi>them on before the expiration of
the time&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish you to write me a lengthy letter and give me all the 
<placeName>Neighbourhood </placeName>news Any thing is interesting to me at this immense
distance from you. Tell me something about <persName>Elias's family.</persName> <persName>Mary</persName>
&#8212;<persName>Adaline</persName>&#8212;<persName>Eliza</persName>&#8212;and <persName>Maria</persName>&#8212;remember me to them affectionately
I <hi rend="italic">never </hi>hear from them&#8212;I suppose they have forgotten me too.
<persName>Moses </persName>has lost a fortune by not comeing out to this <placeName>Country </placeName>in time&#8212;
tho it is not too late&#8212;if he comes by <date n="Fall - 1827">fall</date>&#8212;Remember me 
affectionately to my little <hi rend="italic"><persName>Nephews </persName></hi>and kiss my <hi rend="italic">dear </hi>little " <hi rend="italic">blue eyed <persName>Mary</persName></hi> "
for me&#8212;My respects to <persName>Mr Perry</persName>&#8212;<persName>brother </persName>sends his love to you
and will write you by this opportunity&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas B Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mrs. Emily M. Perry </persName><placeName>Potosi, Mail Missouri</placeName></p>
