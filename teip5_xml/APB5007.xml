<p><placeName>Head Quarters on the Canal above Bexar</placeName> <date when="1835-10-31">Oct. 31st 1835</date></p>

<p>To <persName>Colo. James Bowie </persName>and <persName>Capn. Fanning,</persName></p>

<p>I have taken a position on the <placeName>Alamo Canal</placeName> <placeName>at the mouth of a dry gully
about one mile from town</placeName>,&#8212;There is one, a little nearer, but it can not be
occupied <date when="1835-10-31">to day</date>&#8212; I have certain information that all the surplus horses
except about 250 or 200, were started to <placeName>Laredo </placeName><date when="1835-10-31">last night</date>. The number
that left is reported at 900 head&#8212; The <persName>escort </persName>does not exceed twenty or
<persName>thirty men</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have dispatched <persName>Capn. Travis</persName> with <persName>50 men </persName>to overtake and capture
them&#8212; He has good <persName>guides </persName>and I have no doubt will succeed&#8212;</p>

<p>I have to inform you that a <persName>servant </persName>of <persName>Antonio de la Garza</persName> came into
<placeName>camp </placeName><date when="1835-10-31">today </date>bringing a proposition from the greater part of the <persName>S. 
Fernando Company of Cavalry</persName>, and the one of <placeName>Rio-Grande</placeName>&#8212;to desert&#8212; This
man was sent to procure a guarantee for them, when they come out&#8212; I
have given the guarantee and have now to communicate, to you <hi rend="italic">the mode</hi>
in which they will come out to us&#8212;when etc.&#8212; He says they will be obliged
to come in the <hi rend="italic">day time</hi>, upon some occasion of alarm, when they are 
ordered out,&#8212; These <persName>troops </persName>are stationed in the <placeName>house of <persName>Padilla</persName></placeName> <placeName>in one of
the lower <hi rend="italic">labors </hi></placeName>which <persName>Col.° Bowie</persName> understands the situation of&#8212; It would
be well then for you <date when="1835-11-01">to morrow</date> to make a diversion on that side, so as to
produce the necessary stir; so that they may be ordered out, and thus give
these <persName>men </persName>the chance to come out as it were on duty and then escape&#8212;
They will present themselves with the britch of their guns advanced or a
white flag&#8212; <persName>Padilla </persName>has many <persName>acquaintances </persName>in those <persName>companies</persName>, who sent
in <persName>Garza's servant (Jose Ortis)</persName> to have an understanding with him as to
the guarantee and the mode of joining us.&#8212;</p>

<p>In regard to the measure of harassing the <persName>enemy </persName><date when="1835-10-31">to night</date> as was spoken
of, before we parted, by simultaneous firing on the <placeName>town</placeName>, I have <date when="1835-10-31">today</date>
thot I am obliged to decline it; owing partly to the condition of the <persName>men</persName>
here at present, having lost so much sleep <date when="1835-10-30">last night</date>; and partly to the
difficulty of crossing the <placeName>river </placeName>from here, so as to cooperate in time with
the <persName>men on foot</persName>&#8212; As you will make a diversion <date when="1835-11-01">tomorrow </date>for the purpose
of bringing out the <persName>Deserters</persName>, you will therefore decline anything of the
kind tonight unless you think it better to proceed on your part&#8212; If you
think so you can act as you think best, in that respect, but without expecting<pb n="226"/>
any cooperation from <placeName>this quarter</placeName>, for the reason I have mentioned&#8212; I will
however mention that a few <persName>men </persName>from here may probably fire on the <placeName>Alamo</placeName>,
which is you know <placeName>on this side of the River</placeName>&#8212;about <hi rend="italic">moon down</hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>As there is abundance of corn here, you can use that brought by <persName>Seguin</persName>
for your <persName>Detachment</persName>.</p>

<p>I wish you to send to <placeName><persName>Seguin</persName>s Ranch</placeName> for some rockets that are there&#8212;
2 or 3 dozen&#8212; In Spanish they are called quetes pronounced quates&#8212;we
may want them&#8212;</p>

<p>Please to give me your opinions and those of your <persName>officers </persName>as to the mode
of further operation on the <persName>enemy</persName>.</p>

<p>By order</p>
<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName> [Rubric]</p>
<p><persName>W. D. C. Hall Adjt Gen</persName>.</p>
<p>Dispatch the <persName>bearer </persName>with your answer <date when="1835-10-31">to night</date> as soon possible</p>
<p><persName>S. F. A.</persName></p>
<p>I wish your opinions as to storming or besieging&#8212;</p>
