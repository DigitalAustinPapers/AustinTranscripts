<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,<placeName>Saltill° </placeName><date when="1826-10-10">0ct 10th 1826</date> </p>
<p>I wrote you <date when="1826-10-07">two or three days since</date> and calculated before this to
have been in or near <placeName>Monterrey </placeName>but <date when="1826-10-09">last evening</date> I received inteli-<pb n="1474"/>
gence that a <persName>band of Robbers </persName>had stationed themselves <placeName>on the road
</placeName>to attack the <persName>Americans </persName>who might be returning to <placeName>Refugio </placeName>from the
<placeName>fair </placeName>and what <persName>americans </persName>are in this place have concluded to join
together for their mutual defense&#8212;We certainly start the <date when="1826-10-12">day after
tomorrow</date>&#8212;- have this moment taken my leave of the <persName>members of
the Legislature</persName>&#8212;they have assured me to dispel all doubts relative
to the 13 Art.&#8212;The representation you made on the subject appeared
so just and well founded that the <persName>Author of the <hi rend="italic">Article </hi></persName>himself
(<persName>Carrillo</persName>) asked permission to withdraw it&#8212;I think the <persName>children</persName>
born after the publication of the Constitution will not be freed under
fourteen: Several of the <persName>members </persName>since I have proposed it, are 
inclined not to free them under the age of 25 or 21-&#8212;the arguments and
reasons adduced by myself to convince them of the <hi rend="italic">justice </hi>and 
necessity of this law are to lengthy to insert in this communication but
the principle was the <hi rend="italic">advantage </hi>that would result to the <persName>slave </persName>as
well as to the <persName>Public </persName>to be freed at that age possessed of some useful
branch of industry whereby they might gain a livelihood&#8212;instead of
becoming <hi rend="italic"><persName>vagabonds </persName></hi>and [illegible] ; without any certain way of 
procuring the necessaries of life except in a dishonest manner&#8212;which
must be the case if they are freed at 14. after that age they are 
compelled to stay no longer with their <persName>masters </persName>unless they choose&#8212;At
any rate it is presumable that no <persName>Master </persName>will maintain a large <persName>family</persName>
of <persName>young Negroes </persName>a term of years without receiving some 
compensation for it&#8212;and I say for the trouble and expence the <persName>master </persName>is at
to maintain them from the time they are born untill they are 14&#8212;
let the <persName>slave </persName>serve a few years to recompense them&#8212;after that he
can be <hi rend="italic">freed </hi>possessing health, strength; and <hi rend="italic">Means </hi>to support 
himself without being a <persName>Public pest</persName> and continually a <persName>subject of 
correction</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have stated every <hi rend="italic">reason </hi>that I can invent&#8212;to try and procure
this last clause as favourable as possible&#8212;I am confident if I had not
arrived here, the <persName>children </persName>would have been declared <persName>free </persName>from their
birth&#8212;and if the <hi rend="italic">Art </hi>is <hi rend="italic">passed</hi>&#8212;extending the period of 
Emancipation to 14&#8212;21&#8212;or 25&#8212;I shall flatter <hi rend="italic">myself </hi>as <hi rend="italic">contributing </hi>in a
small degree in obtaining it&#8212;</p>

<p>Since my last to you I have had much conversation (reserved) with
<persName>Padilla </persName>relative to your situation&#8212;and touching the subjects 
generally you have addressed him upon&#8212;</p>

<p>he is your <hi rend="italic">warm </hi>and <hi rend="italic">disinterested <persName>friend</persName></hi>&#8212;he informs me that he
is <hi rend="italic">afraid </hi>at present to do much on the various points you have been
so frank as to submit to his consideration&#8212;because he has no 
confidence in the <persName>members </persName>composing the <persName>Legislature </persName>except the <persName>Baron</persName>
and one or two others the ballance I may say are bought by <persName>Carrillo</persName>-
he says have patience&#8212;as soon as the new <persName>Legislature </persName>takes its seat-
he will present the points you wish granted and has no doubt of sue-<pb n="1475"/>
cess in the mean time lie says you can present any thing else that
you wish&#8212;and consider him as your legal <hi rend="italic"><persName>agent </persName></hi>in all yr transactions
with Govt</p>

<p><persName>Saucedo </persName>is also yr. warm <persName>friend </persName>you must cultivate the same
friendship for him that has always existed&#8212; If he is appointed
the <persName>Commissioner </persName>to pass to the <placeName>frontier </placeName>I expect <hi rend="italic"><persName>Arcinega </persName></hi>will be
appointed his <persName>Secretary</persName>&#8212; No doubt you will receive the 
appointment of <hi rend="italic">Gefe Subalterno</hi>&#8212; This is proof that the <persName>Govr </persName>has a
friendly disposition towards you, As to <persName>Gains </persName>he is so Contemptious
that I have declined makeing any representation to the Gov on
<hi rend="italic">paper</hi>&#8212; I have conversed with all the <persName>Members </persName>respecting him&#8212;
and referred them to the <persName>Baron</persName>&#8212; When the subject comes before
the <placeName>house</placeName>&#8212; I shall not be surprised if those letters be the cause
of his expulsion from the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Country</placeName></hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>English </persName>have left no <hi rend="italic">method untryed</hi> but on the contrary have
used every exertion to induce the <persName>Genl Govt</persName> to regard the <persName>Americans</persName>
with jealousy and suspicion&#8212; They have used all their <hi rend="italic">intrigue</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">influence </hi>to injure the <hi rend="italic">Character </hi>of the <persName>Americans </persName>and many
representations have been made in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>against Amern 
Emigration but the Govt, attributed it to Ambition and <hi rend="italic">that </hi>natural 
antipathy the <persName>English </persName>possess towards us&#8212; Respects to all <persName>friends</persName>
the <persName>Barron </persName>and <persName>Padilla </persName>wish to be remerd&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas B Austin </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p>P. S. I have just seen the <persName>Comt Genl</persName> he appeared glad to see me
and wishes me to remember him to you he also observed that he
hoped to give you u <hi rend="italic">un Abrazo</hi> " between this and <date n="Fall - 1827">next fall</date>, he says
" <hi rend="italic">consider him as your <persName>friend</persName>, and old acquaintance</hi> " he also 
observed that you need have no trouble about the letters <persName>Gaines </persName>and
<persName>Norris </persName>have been writing for men of that stamp are not calculated to
injure you.</p>

<p>The <persName>Baron </persName>says <hi rend="italic">twig </hi>old <persName>McFarland</persName>s memory about some bacon
he was to have paid long <hi rend="italic">since </hi>he wishes it delivered to the order of
<persName>La Baum</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Jas B. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Take good care of my <hi rend="italic">horse</hi>&#8212;</p>
