Federal district court.</add></p>

<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, <date when="1825-05-09">9th May, 1825.</date></p>
<p>Sir:</p>

<p><persName>Mr Green D. Caller [Collier]</persName>, who will present this letter, goes
to the <placeName>Province of Texas </placeName>in pursuit of ten <persName>African negroes</persName> which
were stollen and carried off from the State of <placeName>Alabama </placeName>in the year
<date n="xx-xx-1821">1821</date>, and which are said to be in the said <placeName>Province</placeName>. The said <persName>slaws</persName>
were captured by <persName>Lt. Y. Mckeever</persName> at <placeName>Pensacola </placeName>in the year <date n="xx-xx-1821">1818</date>,
and were at the time of the theft under adjudication in the District
Court of the <placeName>United States</placeName> for the<placeName> District of Alabama</placeName>.</p>

<p>It is said they were stollen by <persName>Robert Caller</persName> out of the possession
of his <persName>aunt</persName>, who is one of the principals to the bond of $100,000
given for the forthcoming of the <persName>slaves </persName>at Court. The bearer of
this letter, who is recommended to me as a man of respectability,
is the <persName>son </persName>of the lady who had the <persName>slaves </persName>in possession, and feeling
a deep interest in restoring them, has volunteered his services for
the purpose.</p>

<p>At the instance of a <persName>gentleman </persName>of this <placeName>State </placeName>of high respectability,
who is acquainted with the circumstances of the case, I take the
liberty to address you upon the subject, and to solicit your friendly
aid and authority in securing the <persName>slaves </persName>so that they may be 
restored to their rightful <persName>owners</persName>. <persName>Robert Caller</persName> is represented as a
desperate character, and may attempt, if not prevented by 
confinement, to rescue the <persName>slaves </persName>even at the risk of his life. It might
perhaps be advisable, if satisfactory proof should be exhibited of
his guilt, to send him back for trial to the place where the crime
was committed.</p>

<p><persName>H. Johnson, Gov. of the State of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>His Excellency, <persName>Baron Bastrop, Governor of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>.</p>
