<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1836-01-21">Jan. 21, 1836</date></p>

<p><persName>Mr. T. F. McKinney</persName></p>

<p>We, that is <persName>Archer </persName>and myself, expect certainly to leave <date when="1836-01-22">tomorrow </date>for
the <placeName>upper country</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>W. H. Wharton</persName> started on the <date when="1836-01-16">16</date> for <placeName>Nashville</placeName>&#8212;we remained to close
the business of the commission in this <placeName>City</placeName>, which we have done in a very<pb n="309"/>
advantageous manner, as I think, for the interests of <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;we have 
effected a second loan of $50,000 for <placeName>land </placeName>at 50 cents pr. acre&#8212;some 
difference between this and the <persName><placeName>monclova </placeName>legislature</persName> which gave <placeName>land </placeName>at about
50. dolls, pr. League&#8212; This loan produced us 40.000 dolls, prompt 
payment in hand</p>

<p>The news from <placeName>all quarters</placeName> is cheering and prosperous for <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;
nothing is wanting but an immediate declaration of independence, and union
and harmony at <placeName>home</placeName>, without this all is lost&#8212; There has been the most
perfect harmony in the <persName>commission</persName>&#8212;we all agree as to the main principles,
and especially as to independence&#8212; I hope that in future there will be
union, more so than there has been,&#8212; If there be good faith in some of
those who have been the most restless I think there will be&#8212;<persName>John Wharton
</persName>assures me that on his part, there will be no more restlessness and his
<persName>brother </persName>says the same&#8212; I know what reply you will make to this&#8212;but my
object is the <placeName>country</placeName>, our <placeName>country</placeName>, it is, or ought to be the paramount object
of all, and without <hi rend="italic">union </hi>and <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi>, our <placeName>country </placeName>is lost.</p>

<p>There are rumors here of disturbances at <placeName>San Felipe</placeName>, which discouraged
the <persName>friends of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> injured her credit, and caused our <persName>enemies </persName>to exult&#8212;</p>

<p>If substantial and deliberate men are elected to the <persName>convention</persName>, and 
violent <persName>demagogues </persName>are permitted to stay at home, all will go right, for such
men will legislate for <hi rend="italic">the <placeName>country</placeName></hi>, and not themselves or for a party.</p>

<p>In well organized Governments, <persName>parties </persName>are usefull for they operate as
checks, but situated as we are in <placeName>Texas </placeName>they are <hi rend="italic">ruinous</hi>, and ought to be
discountenanced&#8212; I have always tried to keep them down, and have been
much censured by my <persName>friends </persName>for yielding, rather than encourage party
feelings&#8212; I may have been wrong, for party spirit never gives credit to
any person for purity of motive&#8212; The situation of <placeName>Texas </placeName>is now critical,
and a great effort is necessary to establish union and harmony- The
<placeName>country </placeName>ought to go <hi rend="italic">unanimously </hi>for independence. Public opinion all
over the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> expects and earnestly calls for it&#8212; Much harm has been
done heretofore by those who have endeavoured to precipitate this Measure,
by violence, partial meetings, and forestaling public opinion by manage-
ment etc. I think they are now convinced of the impropriety of this course,
and will pursue a different one, and a <hi rend="italic">rational </hi>one in future&#8212;at all events
let us all labor to promote <hi rend="italic">union </hi>and <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi>&#8212;</p>

<p>No news from <persName>W.</persName> I fear he is dreaming somewhere. God grant that his
dreams may be less injurious to <placeName>Texas </placeName>than some which were drempt at
<placeName>Monclova</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Love to the <persName>Ladies</persName>&#8212;	<persName>S. F. A.</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr T. F. McKinny</persName> <placeName>Quintana </placeName><persName>Col. J. A. Wharton</persName></p>
