<p><placeName>Winchester Kentucky </placeName><date when="1831-09-29">29th August 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir, I avail myself of the opportunity afforded by <persName>John
T. Mason Esqr.</persName> who is about to visit the <placeName>province of Texas</placeName> and
who will pass through the <placeName>Austin Grant</placeName>, of addressing you on the
subject of the <placeName>grant </placeName>and particularly so far as the <persName>heirs of Mr.
Joseph H Hawkins</persName> are concerned in it.</p>

<p>You have been heretofore informed that <persName>Mrs. Hawkins </persName>resided
with me from a short period after the decease of her <persName>husband </persName>to the
time of her death; that her <persName>children </persName>have been mainly supported by
me; that they are the <persName>nephews </persName>and <persName>niece </persName>of <persName>Mrs. Hawes</persName>, that I have
been appointed by the proper <persName>tribunal of this <placeName>country</placeName></persName> their <persName>guardian</persName>;
and that their only prospect or hope of advancement from their
<persName>father</persName>s estate is founded on their interest in your <placeName>grant</placeName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>children </persName>are some of them now grown and all of them
approaching maturity, and they feel a strong interest in knowing
what they may expect from your <placeName>quarter</placeName>. Standing in the relation
which I do, towards them I feel it to be my duty to enquire of
you as to the position in which they stand, and the rights and interests
which they have in the property under your management.   With a<pb n="692"/>
view of procuring full information in relation to the interests of
the <persName>heirs of Mr. Hawkins </persName>in the <placeName>grant</placeName>, I have authorized<persName> Mr. Mason
</persName>to call on you, and as my <persName>agent </persName>to request of you to furnish him
with an account of the <placeName>boundaries of the Grant</placeName>, the quantity of
land, how much of the <placeName>grant </placeName><persName>yourself </persName>and the <persName>heirs of Mr. Hawkins</persName>
are entitled to under your contract of <persName>copartnership </persName>in the lands;
to inform him whether the portion to which the <persName>copartnership </persName>are
entitled has been surveyed and set apart from the remainder of the
<placeName>grant</placeName>; if so whether there has been a division between <persName>yourself </persName>and
the <persName>heirs of Hawkins</persName>, and if not whether you desire such a division.
In the event of a division, what acts on the part of <persName>Hawkins heirs
</persName>will be necessary to hold their <placeName>lands </placeName>according to the laws of your
<placeName>country </placeName>etc. etc. and in fine every information touching the subject
which is in your possession. <persName>Mr. Mason</persName> has undertaken under the
authority I have conferred on him to make a report of the condition
of the <placeName>grant </placeName>so far as the <persName>heirs of Hawkins</persName> are concerned and the
state of the copartnering accounts with you. I presume that 
<persName>Edmund St. Jn° Hawkins one of the heirs</persName>  is in the <placeName>province of Texas</placeName>.
He is yet a minor, but it is possible he may be of some service to
you, and that he may furnish some aid in the settlement of the <placeName>lands
which belong to the <persName>grantees</persName>.</placeName> I have written you two letters on
this subject since<persName> Mrs. Hawkins</persName> death, but have recd, no reply.
The original papers of correspondence between <persName>yourself </persName>and <persName>Mrs
Hawkins&#8212;</persName>relating to this property are in my possession. The 
letters to <persName>Mrs Hawkins</persName> evince on your part much affection towards
the <persName>family</persName>, and a determined purpose to do them entire justice.
The favourable reports I have heard of you induce me to believe,
that their interests will be safe under your agency. <persName>Mr. Mason</persName>after he reaches your <placeName>country </placeName>will be able to suggest to you more
fally than I can the precise points of information about the 
<placeName>property</placeName>, which it may concern the <persName>heirs of Hawkins</persName> to know.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Mason</persName> is a <persName>Gentleman of high standing</persName> in this country, of great
intelligence, and information, and has recently enjoyed a station of
much honour under the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. He is one
of the <persName><placeName>Virginia </placeName>family</persName> known to every well informed <persName>citizen </persName>of the
<placeName>U States</placeName> and a <persName>family </persName>identified with the political history of our
<placeName>country</placeName>. The present <persName>postmaster General of the U States (Mr
Barry</persName>) is his <persName>brother in law </persName>any aid or attention you may afford
him will, while in your <placeName>country </placeName>will confer a favour.</p>

<p><persName>Richard Hawes.</persName></p>

<p>N. B. I have furnished<persName> Mr. Mason</persName> with a copy of your contract
with <persName>Mr. Hawkins</persName>, to which you may refer, in the event that you are
not possessed of a duplicate</p>

<p><persName>R. Hawes</persName></p>
