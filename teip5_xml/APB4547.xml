<p><placeName>Convention Room, San Felipe De Austin.</placeName></p>

<p><date when="1833-04-04">Thursday, April 4, 1833.</date></p>
<p>On motion of <persName>David G. Burnet</persName>, it was</p>

<p>Resolved; That, whereas it has been reported to this Convention,
that a vessel under foreign colours has recently arrived in, and de-<pb n="942"/>
parted from the <placeName>Bay of Galveston</placeName>; that she came direct from the
<placeName>Island of Cuba</placeName>, and was laden with <persName>negroes</persName>.&#8212; And whereas it has
also been stated, that these unfortunate beings are recently from
the <placeName>African Coast</placeName>, and speak only their vernacular tongue. The
<persName>Convention </persName>do hold in utter abhorrence all participation, whether
direct, or indirect, in the African <persName>Slave </persName>Trade&#8212;that we do concur in
the general indignation which has been manifested throughout the
<placeName>civilized world</placeName> against that inhuman and unprincipled traffic. And
we do, therefore, earnestly recommend to our constituents, the good
<persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, that they will not only abstain from all concern
in that abominable traffic, but that they will unite their efforts to
prevent the evil from polluting our shores; and will aid and 
sustain the civil authority in detecting and punishing any similar 
attempt for the future.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the <placeName>Island of Cuba</placeName>, as pertaining to the <placeName>Kingdom
of Spain</placeName>, is an <placeName>enemies country</placeName>, and by necessary consequence, all
commercial, or other intercourse with it, or its <persName>inhabitants</persName>, is an 
infraction of our most sacred duties as good and faithful <persName>citizens of the
<placeName>Mexican Republic</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>Therefore, This <persName>Convention </persName>would advise, and enjoin upon all the
good <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, that they discountenance by all possible means,
every attempt to fix upon the moral and political character of our
young <placeName>community </placeName>the odious epithet of treason, or the still more 
detestable stigma of Piracy.</p>

<p>The <persName>Convention </persName>feel a proud satisfaction in believing that the
late shameful violation of law, and of every patriotic duty, was 
perpetrated by transient <persName>foreign adventurers</persName>.</p>

<p>On motion of <persName>Ira Ingram</persName>, seconded by <persName>Thomas Hastings</persName>.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the resolution, relative to the introduction of 
<persName>African negroes from the<placeName> Island of Cuba</placeName>, or <placeName>elsewhere</placeName></persName>, and relative to
the prosecution of commerce with the <placeName>Island</placeName>, be signed by the 
<persName>President and Secretary of this Convention</persName>, and be published in the <placeName>Texas
Advocate</placeName>, and transmitted to <placeName>New-Orleans</placeName> for publication in the
papers of that city; and also to the several<placeName> presses of Mexico</placeName>, for
publication throughout the<placeName> Mexican Republic</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>W. H. Wharton, <hi rend="italic">Chairman</hi></persName>.</p>
<p><persName>Thos. Hastings, <hi rend="italic">Secretary</hi>,</persName></p>
