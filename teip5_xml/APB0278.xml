Surprised at what you say about <persName>Gibsons </persName>not having procured a <placeName>New

shall literally bury myself this <date n="Spring-1817">Spring </date>and <date n="Summer-1817">Summer </date>in the <persName>Mines</persName>
and if attention and industry will affect anything I shall do much</p>

<p>When the <persName>family </persName>are gone I hope <persName>Sister </persName>will not desert me, but
will very often enliven the <placeName>Hall </placeName>with her Society when left here
alone how I shall envy her the Company of little <hi rend="italic"><persName>Joel </persName></hi>his prattle
would be music to me compared to the <hi rend="italic">dull </hi>cheerless, chiling Silence
which will pervade the <placeName>Hall </placeName>when deserted by all but a Solatary
<persName>Batchelor</persName>!!&#8212;</p>

<p>My prospects at the <placeName>Hill </placeName>are not very promising I am sinking new
Shafts&#8212; the furnace goes in this night and I expect to Make about
16000 pounds of Lead this Smelt which I will send immediately over
to <placeName>Hercum </placeName>The Money on your note in <persName>Bank </persName>which I used I will
repay as soon as the lead is made or you may deduct that much from
what is to be made up for <persName>H Elliott</persName></p>

<p>Write wheither you can make any arrangement to raise that Money,
if not I must by Some means or Execution will be out immediately&#8212;

Beef and Pork, I should have called on my way home but was anxious
to arrive in time for the wedding&#8212;the new Married Couple Started

right arm which prevents her writing   Kiss <persName>Jo</persName>. and love to <persName>Sister</persName>&#8212;</p>
