<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1836-06-23">June 23d 1836</date></p>

<p>Dear <persName>Genl</persName>.</p>

<p>I write merely to say that the <persName>Acting President of the Govt, of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
Jose Justo Carro</persName>, has determined to disregard the Armistice agreed upon
between <persName>Genl Houston</persName> and <persName>St Anna</persName>, and he has issued his proclamation
declaring his intention to prosecute the War against <placeName>Texas </placeName>immediately.
Our <placeName>Country</placeName>, it seems by this publication, (which has been republished in
the <placeName>Bulletin of this City</placeName>), is to be invaded by <persName>seventeen thousand Men</persName>. The
prevailing opinion here is that <placeName>Texas </placeName>should loose no time in Making ample
preparation to repel the expected invasion: And acting under this 
impression the <persName>Citizens of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> who are here have joined in a recommendation
to <persName>Genl Hunt</persName> to proceed immediately with his preparations to raise and
organize his <persName>Division</persName>, as you May see by the enclosed Copy. A report
reached here today from <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName> that the <persName>Govt </persName>was not able to raise the
men and Money to Carry on another Campaign against us. I did not learn
from what authority this report emanated, but it is only necessary for us
to reflect how wofully the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> have been lead astray by such
idle remours to lead us at once to the conclusion that now is the time to
prepare for action.<pb n="370"/></p>

<p>I leave <date when="1836-06-24">in the morning</date> for <placeName>Mobile</placeName>, thence to <placeName>Claiborne</placeName>, from whence I
shall return with all possible despatch. Please Write Me to <placeName>San Augustine</placeName>
immediately upon the receipt of this, and if in your opinion the return of
the Archives had better be delayed I will act upon your advice.</p>

<p>I am much indisposed therefore Must Make My letter Short</p>

<p><persName>R. Peebles</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Gen. S. F. Austin</persName> <placeName>Quintanna Texas</placeName></p>
