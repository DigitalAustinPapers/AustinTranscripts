<p>Your Favour of <date when="1834-11-28">28th Nov</date> enclosing bills of articles shipd- pr Schooner
Helin Mar, was duely recieved and you have no doubt been informed of the
fate of that vessel, the vessel and cargo was all most a total loss, the
greater part of the Goods which came to shore was stolen the articles sent
to me were all lost I beleave except 11 BB1 Flour and 1 do Mackeral. A
<persName>Mr. Andrews</persName> will inform you more particularly; who will forward you
the necessary vouchers to recover the insurance I hope they were inshured.
having but lately commenced opening a <placeName>farm </placeName>I had put Little land in
cotton last season and the worm distroyed the greater part of that Little
as well as all the cotton in my <placeName>emedeate neigbourhood</placeName>. there was scarce
one third of a crop made. It was my intention to have shiped you what
Little I made but on enquiry I found unless the dueties amounted to 200$
the money would have to be paid to the <persName>collector</persName>: I concluded it would
be more trouble to you than proffit and I got one of my <persName>neighbours </persName>to
ship it with his crop it went up in the S[chooner] Brazoria and sold for
16c. It was some disapointment the loss of the articles you sent me. but
I hope you will recover the inshurance on them. The cotton crops in this
county was verry fine with the Exception of some 5 or 6 <placeName>plan[ta]tions</placeName> in<pb n="40"/>
my <placeName>neighbourhood </placeName>which was destroyed by the worm since <date n="03-xx-1834">last march</date>
we have generally and verry fine wether the <date n="Fall-1834">fall </date>and <date n="Winter-1834">winter </date>so
far has been verry much pleasant and dry. <persName>Mr. Somervell</persName> returned
from <placeName>New York</placeName> in the <placeName>San Felepe</placeName> in <date n="11-xx-1834">nov</date>. but I am sorry to say that he
has not got near all his goods to <placeName>San Felepe</placeName> yet. he might have got them
up in the steapi[boat] Cayuga which went up but his <persName>partner </persName>was not 
willing to risk it. The boat however got up without any accident he tarryed
at least one month too long in <placeName>New York</placeName> for his benefit please inform me
whether you have recovered the inshurance on the Empress also the lost
on the Helin Mar</p>
