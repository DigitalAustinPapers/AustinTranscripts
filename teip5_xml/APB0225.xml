<p>My Dear <persName>Son </persName>[in New Orleans]</p>

<p>When I wrote you last I was under very great apprehension of
the <persName>Indians </persName>and I did truly think that we should have a visit from
them in a few days&#8212;but things have changed and I am now 
satisfied that we are safe, great exertions have been made, and many
<persName>troops </persName>called out, and are now out on the <placeName>frontier</placeName>, the <persName>Indians </persName>that
threatened this <placeName>Territory </placeName>have retired back to [the] <placeName>Wilds of the
North</placeName>, and the <persName>Troops on the <placeName>North of the Meremac</placeName></persName> I think 
sufficient to keep them on <placeName>that Side of the River</placeName>. I have seen an account
of a most deadful storm in <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, that has don[e] much damages
you will write me an a/c in your next I have also seen an account
of <persName>Negroes </persName>being landed in <placeName>St Augustine</placeName> and <placeName>Pensacola </placeName>in excellant
order and under the command of <persName>British officers</persName>, and that great
apprehensions existed in consequence of many <persName>Negroes </persName>running away,
and, joining the <persName>English </persName>Standard. Should this be true, I have a
desire that you leave a <placeName>Country </placeName>where you will be in greater danger
from <persName>Negroes </persName>than we are from <persName>Indians</persName>, but of this you will be the
better Judge. As much as I apprehend danger from <persName>Negroes </persName>in the
<placeName>low Country</placeName>, I wish I had 50 more at the <placeName>mines </placeName>I could make the
value of them this year in the state the <placeName>mines </placeName>are in and I have 
Supposed that you could make yourself acquainted how they may be
obtained in <placeName>Carolina </placeName>from <persName>Mr Hampton</persName>, and If you could by any
contract obtain 10, or 12, payable in <placeName>Orleans</placeName>. It would make a great
alteration in our business&#8212; You must be carefull in puting your
cargo in <placeName>Orleans </placeName>for sale and the price of the Shott will be 
determined by the Order of your cargo, may be when presented for sale,
I have mentioned that I should make ready an Other cargo of sheet
lead and that you had better stay untill It arrived, this I still think,
for the best and had not the <persName>Indians </persName>have put a stop to every kind of
business I should have had the Cargo of [f] before this time I shall
make exertions to forward it to you so as to arrive in all next month,
and I think you had better attend untill that time.   .   .</p>

<p>[Moses Austin.]</p>
