<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1833-09-11">Sept. 11 1833</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I have nothing particular to say, more than what I informed you
of by last mail. The cholera has abated, but there is not yet a 
<persName>majority of members</persName> in this <placeName>city </placeName>so that there will be no meeting of
<persName>Congress </persName>for a week or ten days yet.</p>

<p>I think I shall succeed in getting the 11 article of<date when="1830-04-06"> 6 april</date> law 
repealed&#8212;the establishment of weekly mails from <placeName>Monclova </placeName>to <placeName>Sabine</placeName>,
from <placeName>Matamoras </placeName>to <placeName>Goliad </placeName>and from <placeName>San Felipe</placeName> to <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>and
<placeName>Liberty</placeName></p>

<p>The duties on Importations will be reduced and probably 
suspended, for a time in to to, tho the latter is not yet certain.</p>

<p>The State question must take its course as prescribed in the 
constitution and be sent to the <placeName>other States</placeName>.</p>

<p>The revolution is not over and God knows when it will be. I
have great confidence in the <persName>vice president Gomez Farias</persName>, If the
<persName>heroes </persName>of the + [cross] get the upper hand it is difficult to say what
they will do as to <placeName>Texas </placeName>matters and it is very probable there will<pb n="1006"/>
be a breaking up of the <persName>Govt</persName>.   But there is no prospect that they
will succeed at present.</p>

<p>In <date n="10-xx-1833">October </date>the time expires for locating <placeName>grants</placeName>. See that <persName>Williams</persName>
attends to all that business and also to <persName>Padilla</persName>s&#8212;dont neglect this.
Also try and collect something on the notes due me. I shall spend
about 2000 Dollars or probably 2,500 on this trip and as I am 
laboring for the common good no honest man will refuse to pay what he
justly owes me.</p>

<p>Were it not for you and <persName>Emily </persName>and the <persName><hi rend="italic">Old Settlers</hi></persName> I doubt
whether I Should not remain here for a year or two&#8212;that is unless
the revolution continues, for then no one will be safe here.</p>

<p>I have recd, <hi rend="italic">one </hi>letter from <placeName>Texas </placeName>since I left there, from
<persName>John </persName>dated in <date n="06-xx-1833">June</date>&#8212;I have written every mail since I arrived
here, I hope the <persName>family </persName>are all well at <placeName>Chocolate Bayou</placeName>. I have
more confidence of health there than at <placeName>peach point</placeName> I do not know
whether <persName>Williams </persName>has returned&#8212;or not&#8212;he was to have left <placeName>Mobile</placeName>
about the middle of <date when="1833-07-15">July </date>as he wrote me from there. Tell <persName>John</persName>
to keep clear of <persName>land speculators</persName>. I had rather herd with devils than
with that class of mankind.</p>

<p>I am unhappy that I do not hear from you&#8212;how are the <persName>children</persName>&#8212;
what kind of a crop&#8212;how is <persName>Stephen (my brothers boy)</persName> and your
<persName>neighbors </persName>and a thousand things,</p>

<p>My health is good at this time</p>

<p>farewell                             <persName> S. F. A</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>There were <persName>43000 sick</persName> here at one time The deaths I believe have
been about 18000. I have never witnessed such a horrible scene of
distress and death. The <persName>common people</persName> in a part of the state of
<placeName>Puebla </placeName>got an idea that the water was poisoned by the <persName>foreigners</persName>
and they massacred seven <persName>frenchmen </persName>in one <placeName>village</placeName>&#8212;all the 
<persName>foreigners </persName>in that place. Remember me to <persName>H Austin</persName> and <persName>Phillips </persName>and his
<persName>wife </persName>and to your <persName>neighbors</persName>&#8212;tell <persName>Henry </persName>that he must not neglect to
locate his <placeName>other League of land</placeName> before the time expires.</p>

<p>I cannot tell when I shall get home I intend to persevere to the
end and effect what I came for if I can regardless of time or expense.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. A.</persName>.</p>
