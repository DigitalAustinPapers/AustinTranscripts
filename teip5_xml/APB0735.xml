<p>Sir</p>

<p>In compliance of your Request I have Called on <persName>Carrete </persName>and sent
for Spanish John and Read the Treaty and had it interpreted and
after Giving a Talk he agreed to Sign the Treaty and Said he would
Move out of the <placeName>Settlement </placeName>in a few days, but he told me he wanted
to see you before he Started. I gave him a Copy of the Treaty which
he will shew to you I Told him verry posetively that after he had
signed the Treaty he must Comply with it he appeared Verry 
Humble and agreed to the Contents of it saying it was good <persName>Chino </persName>also
signed it Saying he was an old <persName>Captain</persName>. <persName>Carrete </persName>wants me to write
to you to give him some Tobacco Corn and powder you Can do as
you please about that&#8212; I Read the Treaty to the people at our 
meeting the other day at <persName>Rossen [Rawson] Allys </persName>they were all well
pleased with it&#8212;- I do think a good one for which some of us gives
you our thanks&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>people of our <placeName>Destrict</placeName></persName> tried to Elect their <persName>officers </persName>on the day
apointed but were so much devided they Could not do it. the <placeName>Lower
and upper end of the Destrict</placeName> is so much devided I think it will be
best to separate us and let the <placeName>big Lake on the Colorado</placeName> be the 
division there will then be about 30 men in Each Destrict and the people
will all be better sattisfied&#8212;they were all well sattisfied with the
Consitution the <persName>governor</persName>s proclamation and your adress and said
nothing against your letter, the most of them ware there and all
Took the oath&#8212;and rejoiced etc</p>
