<p>Sir Enclosed I send you a translation of the Constitutional Decree
of the Sovereign <persName>Congress </persName>of the <placeName>Mexican nation</placeName> establishing the
form of Government also I send you a proclamation of the <persName>Political
Chief of this <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> to the <persName>inhabitants of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName>, and an
address of my own to the <persName>Settlers</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Political Chief of the <placeName>Province</placeName></persName> by his official letter dated the
<date when="1824-03-18">18 March last</date> has ordered that all the <persName>inhabitants of this <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName>
should swear to the Constitutional Act, and to the Federal 
Republican System of Government and considering the extent of this 
district and the inconvenience which the <persName>inhabitants </persName>of the <placeName>lower part</placeName>
of it would experience if they wrere compelled to come to this place,
I have thought proper to convene them at the <placeName>house of <persName>J. B. Baily</persName>
</placeName>on <date when="1824-05-01">Saturday the first day of May next</date>, as you will perceive by the
enclosed notices which you will put up without delay</p>

<p>Should the <persName>Alcalde </persName>of this district not attend you are hereby 
appointed to act on the <date when="1824-05-01">1st. of May</date> in his place, and you will 
accordinly first read to the people this letter&#8212;then the Constitutional act&#8212;
then the Proclamation of the <persName>Political Chief of the <placeName>Province</placeName></persName>, and
then my address to the <persName>settlers</persName>&#8212;you will then state to them the <hi rend="italic">oath</hi>
which is in these words&#8212;" you swear to observe and obey the 
Constitutional Act of federation of the <placeName>Mexican Nation</placeName> " to which they
will all answer " yes we swear " and then let them give three cheers,
fire a salute of small arms, or any other demonstration of joy and
rejoicing that may be deemed proper by the people&#8212;   The oath need<pb n="771"/>
not be given to them seperately but to all at once collectively, this is
the custom in this <placeName>nation </placeName>on such occasions</p>

<p>I have also ordered an election at the same time for a <persName>Lieutenant
of militia for the <placeName>lower division of this District</placeName></persName>, who will be 
governed by the instructions given to you&#8212; This I do that the 
<persName>inhabitants </persName>of that <placeName>settlement </placeName>may not even have a shadow of pretext to
complain of their <persName>officers</persName>, for altho the <persName>superior Government</persName> have
ordered me to oppoint <hi rend="italic">all </hi>the militia officers, yet I have no wish to
do so, as some captious persons in the <placeName>Colony </placeName>seem to think&#8212;</p>

<p>The returns must be sent to me as soon as possible, and you will
resign the command to the person elected&#8212;</p>

<p>You will as soon as possible send me an account of your 
proceedings under this order that I may make up my report to the 
<persName>Government</persName></p>

<p>God and Liberty, Union and happiness</p>

<p><placeName>St Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1824-04-20">April 20 1824</date></p>

<p><persName>Stephen F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>To <persName>Josiah H. Bell Pol. Chief</persName></p>

<p>You will have the enclosed power for the <persName>Baron </persName>signed without
delay and send it back by <persName>Captain Gaines</persName>, as they are wating for
it at <placeName>St Antonio</placeName>&#8212;there is not time to call the people together and
have an election and we could not do better than to appoint the <persName>Baron</persName></p>

<p><persName>Austin </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>request <persName>Gaines </persName>as he comes back to get the people at the <placeName>Fort </placeName>to
sign it&#8212;</p>
