<p><placeName>Texas, Austin's Colony,</placeName> <date when="1831-04-09">April 9th 1831</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir,</p>
<p>I am sorry to be compelled to trouble you with a few lines, but
necessity forces me to do it, I arrived with my own, and eight more
<persName>families</persName>, on the <date when="1831-04-02">2nd Inst,</date> at <placeName>Harrisburgh</placeName>, at which place I learned
that, the <persName>families </persName>I had brought out <date n="Fall-1830">Last fall</date> were ordered <placeName>below
the St Antonio road,</placeName> and that they had all moved down, the most of
them to <placeName><persName>Mr. Milligan</persName>'s</placeName>, I immediately went to <placeName>St Phillippi,</placeName> to know
the particulars, while there, an order arrived, that all the <persName>families</persName>,
and myself, should return, to the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> I at first concluded to go
immediately, but all with whom I convers'd, at <placeName>St Phillippi </placeName>advised
me to wait, and pe[ti]tion for priviledge to remain in this <placeName>colony</placeName>,
and become a <persName>settler </persName>here, I have arranged all my business in
the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> and came with view to become a <persName>permanent residentor</persName> in
this <placeName>country</placeName>, and have sacrificed much, and underwent a great deal
of fatigue, and trouble, to get here, if we have to return, it will break
us all prety well.</p>

<p>I anticipated no such difficulties, or I never should have engaged
in the business, but remain'd where I was well settled in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>.</p>

<p>As I believe it is in your power to do more with the government,
and with <persName>Genl Teran</persName>, than any one else, and believing that you
are dispos'd to be friendly toward us, I now take the liberty to
request you, to intercede for us in any way your discretion, may
point out, and that as soon as you can, for I will not be able to
know what to do until I hear from you. If I am obliged to return
the sooner I know it the better, or if I am permitted to remain,
I wish to be trying to settle myself, if I can remain, I wish to settle
in the <placeName>uper part of your colony</placeName>.<pb n="643"/></p>

<p>Any attention paid to my situation by you, will be greatfully
acknowledged, now is the time, sir, for you to do me, perhaps a
greater kindness, than you may ever have an opportunity to do me
again.</p>

<p><persName>Alexr Thomson</persName></p>

<p>N. B. until I hear my destiny, I expect to recide in the settlement
of <persName>Mr Milligan</persName>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo S. F. Austin,</persName> <placeName>Diputado Leona Vicario</placeName>. Att of
<persName>Majr Reynolds</persName></p>
