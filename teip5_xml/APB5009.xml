<p><placeName>Head Quarters</placeName> <date when="1835-11-01">Novemr lst 1835</date></p>

<p>To <persName>Col° James Bowie</persName> and <persName>Captn Fanning</persName>,</p>

<p>Your communication of<date when="1835-11-01"> this morning</date> was received and is satisfactory in
every respect to myself and all others&#8212;</p>

<p>I sent in a demand today, for a surrender <persName>Genl Cos</persName> stated that his duty
would not permit him to receive any official communication and of course
it was returned, unopened,&#8212; He in a short time after sent out<persName> Padre Garza</persName>
with a flag to say to me, verbally that he had absolute orders from his
<persName>Government </persName>to fortify <placeName>Bexar </placeName>and hold it at all hazards&#8212;that as a <persName>military
man</persName> His honor and duty required obedience to these orders, that he would
defend the place until he died, if he had only ten men left with him&#8212;</p>

<p>This is all that has passed between us&#8212; I approached on this side <date when="1835-11-01">to day</date>
within Cannon shot&#8212;they fired four at us&#8212;one shot (Ball) passed over
our heads and one of <hi rend="italic">grape </hi>fell <placeName>in the lines</placeName> but fortunately injured
no one&#8212;</p>

<p>From every information the <placeName>fortifications </placeName>are much stronger than has
been supposed and the difficulty of storming of course much greater,&#8212;The
system of alarms will be kept up as much as possible night and day, and
the place invested as closely as practicable&#8212; For this purpose I expect to
station the <persName>Adjutant General</persName> with a competent <persName>force </persName>at the <placeName>old mill</placeName>, a short
distance from there&#8212;</p>

<p>I have no information yet of <persName>Travis</persName>&#8212; A report reached <placeName>Camp </placeName><date when="1835-11-01">this 
afternoon</date> through a <persName>person from <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> that an <persName>Express </persName>had just been received
there, stating that <persName>Savariego </persName>had escaped from <placeName>S. Felipe</placeName> and had raised
the <persName>Irish on the <placeName>Nueces</placeName></persName>, and in union with the <persName>troops at <placeName>that place</placeName></persName> had
attacked <placeName>Goliad</placeName>&#8212;It is however only a report&#8212;</p>

<p>The enclosed papers is from a <persName>Confidential source</persName>&#8212; I had forgotten to
mention that the <persName>Adjutant General</persName> made a demonstration on the other side
with a <persName>Detachment</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>Since the within was written I have received yours of this <date when="1835-11-01">afternoon</date>&#8212;
The <persName>forces </persName>are not so unequally divided as appears at first view&#8212;<persName>Travis</persName>
is constantly out on some extra duty&#8212; He is now out, I expect him <date when="1835-11-01">to night</date>
and must then send him to escort the cannon&#8212; I wish to occupy the <placeName>mill</placeName>
and another position&#8212; our <persName>prisoners </persName>are dayly increasing and require a
<persName>strong guard</persName>.</p>

<p>However as equal a division will be made as is compatible with the 
service&#8212;we have many sick&#8212; Every thing shall be done on my part possible
for the service and to keep up harmony.<pb n="228"/></p>

<p>Our position here is far from being a strong one&#8212; we have no bank for
defense&#8212;a good position can not be found without going too far off. I
submit these matters to your calm judgement&#8212; It is known that <placeName>head 
quarters</placeName> are here and the main attack will be here if any is made</p>

<p>I have just heard from <persName>Travis </persName>he will not be back untill late <date when="1835-11-02">tomorrow</date>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>[Rubric]</p>
