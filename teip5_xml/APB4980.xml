<p><placeName>Mission of Espada</placeName>, <date when="1835-10-23">23d octr 1835</date></p>
<p>5 Oclk P M friday evening</p>

<p><persName>Genl Austin</persName>&#8212;In conformity with your orders, and agreeably to our
suggestions of<date when="1835-10-22"> last night</date>, we marched to the <placeName>Missions above this</placeName>, and make
the following report of their situation and such oher information as we
deem important&#8212;at the <placeName>Mission of St Juan</placeName>, they only planted three pecks
of corn, and it is <hi rend="italic">yet <placeName>in the field</placeName></hi>, and very fine&#8212;The <persName>Citizens </persName>are well 
disposed, and now look to us for protection&#8212;and should the <persName>Enimy </persName>attempt
to withdraw their corn, information will be forthwith recd- from them</p>

<p>At the <placeName>Mission of St Jose</placeName>, we find <hi rend="italic">no corn</hi>, the <placeName>dam </placeName>having been broke
early this season and the crop abandoned&#8212;only a small crop of Peas, and
these not yet well ripened&#8212;This <placeName>Mission </placeName>is in a dilapidated state and only
<persName>one family</persName> at it&#8212;At the former, several respectable <persName>families</persName>, and the walls
in a good state of preservation, and a strong hold for defence&#8212;</p>

<p><placeName>St Jose</placeName> has fine <placeName>quarters </placeName>for the <persName>men</persName>, but the <hi rend="italic">water too remote</hi>, and too
much at the mercy of the <persName>enimy</persName>&#8212; No intelligence from the <persName>Segienes</persName>, as
yet&#8212;We learn that <persName>reinforcements </persName>to the amt of <persName>30 men</persName> arrived&#8212;in <placeName>Bexar</placeName>
<date when="1835-10-22">last night</date>&#8212;also that you had a slight skirmish with an <placeName>outpost </placeName>in which
they report only one killed&#8212;he being shot in the eye&#8212;</p>

<p>They say two more <persName>parties of reinforcements</persName> are looked for daily&#8212;If we
had fifty men more, we could keep out <persName>spyes </persName><placeName>on the two road</placeName>s and cut
them off, and be in no sort of danger ourselves</p>

<p>There is but little money in <placeName>Camp</placeName>&#8212;and the <persName>men </persName>are complaining that
corn and other provisions are not furnished them&#8212;</p>

<p>We will make purchases of Beef and corn <date when="1835-10-23">tonight </date>with our own funds
and hope to hear from you <date when="1835-10-24">tomorrow </date>early&#8212;Our private resources are
quite limited, and cannot be expected to last beyond <date when="1835-10-24">tomorrow</date>&#8212;or we
should not apply to you for aid&#8212;You know the materials we have&#8212;they
will fight&#8212;and fight desperately; but must <hi rend="italic">Eat</hi>.
We expect to take a position in the timber, <placeName>near Bexar</placeName>, <date when="1835-10-24">tomorrow</date>; and
request regular information from you, that we may be fully apprized of
your movements, and know how far ours comport with your views; and
will insure success to our cause.&#8212;The <persName>Courier from <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> has this moment
come in, and says that the man reported shot and killed, is not dead&#8212;but
shot where we heard, and must certainly die&#8212;and the <persName>leader of the party</persName>,
slightly wounded by a Pistol ball and only <hi rend="italic">three </hi>Rifles heard crack&#8212;
They have put the <persName>commander </persName>and most of the <persName>men </persName>in <hi rend="italic"><placeName>prison </placeName></hi>for 
cowardice&#8212;The <persName>reinforcements </persName>did arrive, under <persName>Baragan </persName>with <persName>30 men</persName>&#8212;and no
more spoken of&#8212;He is stationed in <placeName>5th street</placeName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>Politcal Chief</persName> has fled&#8212;and every other principal man we wrote
to with him&#8212; Their <persName>force </persName>was 100&#8212;and yours reported only 15&#8212;<pb n="206"/></p>

<p>The <persName>owner of <placeName>this place</placeName></persName> is <hi rend="italic">suspected</hi>, and the <persName>courier </persName>would not approach
him for fear of detection and exposure (<persName>Jose Antonio Garza</persName> is his name)
Do let us hear from you, and receive some aid to furnish provisions for
our <persName>men</persName>&#8212;Should you send, your <persName>courier </persName>will hear from us hear</p>

<p>In haste, We subscribe ourselves</p>
