<p><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> <date when="1812-07-12">July 12 1812</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Father</persName></p>

<p>I wrote you from the [undecipherable] stating the situation of
the Cargo which is sunk there and saying that I should return home,
But in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">Declaration of War</hi> I have determined
to stay here untill I get up the Cargo and make sale of it, and then
I can proced immediately on to <placeName>N. York</placeName> with out delay&#8212;</p>

<p>The declaration of war was received here by <persName>express </persName>from 
<placeName>Washington </placeName>on the <date when="1812-07-08">8th Inst</date> and has thrown every thing into confusion.
Business is almost anihilated Cotton fell in one day from 9.50 to
5 and 4.50 There are a great many Vessels in port all loaded and
redy for sea they are now Striping and laying them up&#8212;</p>

<p>Amidst my <hi rend="italic">misfortunes </hi>I think I have been <hi rend="italic">truly fortunate</hi>, for
had I arrived safe here. I should have saild about the <date when="1812-06-29">29th of June</date>
and should have undoubtedly been Captured,&#8212;Report says that
there were thirty odd <persName>Privateers </persName>laying at <placeName>New Providence</placeName> ready
for sea as soon as the declaration of war reached them&#8212;and that <placeName>all
the Forts in the British Islands</placeName> were fitting out as fast as possible
in expectation of the war. so that they were prepared for 
immediate opperation the moment war was declair'd, It is the general
oppinion that all the vessels which cleard the <placeName>Balize </placeName>after the <date when="1812-06-16">16th
of June</date> will be taken about 15 in number, in fact Insurance cannot
be got on those which cleard it on the <date when="1812-06-10">10th</date> and <date when="1812-06-12">12th </date>of less than 50
pr cent.</p>

<p><persName>Genl Wilkinson</persName> arrivd here on the <date when="1812-07-09">9th</date>. on Bord the U. S. Brig
Enterprise and has <hi rend="italic">resumed the Command</hi>, he was welcomed by a
salute from <placeName>Fort St. Charles</placeName> etc&#8212;There is but little said about him
nothing has been done as yet with the <persName>Troop </persName>here&#8212;The Coffee
House Books this Morning say that <hi rend="italic"><persName>Sir. James Yoes</persName></hi> in <placeName>Frigate
South Hampton</placeName> is off the <placeName>Balize</placeName>&#8212;One of our gun Boats a few
day[s] since in an engagement with two <persName>French Privateers</persName> who
had Capt'd a <persName>Spanish </persName>ship at the <placeName>Ba[lize]</placeName> burst his 26 pounder
wounded some of his men and&#8212;Run away!!</p>

<p>The sickness will soon commence here I shall therefore leave this
<date when="1812-07-13">tomorrow </date>in the Steam Boat for <placeName>Natchez </placeName>where I mean to stay until
<persName>Burt </persName>pays what he owes then I will return to the <placeName>Attackapa </placeName>and
try and make something out of the [undecipherable] which <persName>Dun</persName>
has&#8212;There is no price for <hi rend="italic">lead </hi>tho. I think it would bring 6$ Sheet
lead wile sell well and also Shott. Coffee rose in two days from
18. to 25 cents and is still on the rise&#8212;</p>
