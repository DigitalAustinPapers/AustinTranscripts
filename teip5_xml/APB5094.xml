<p>To <persName>Gen. Sam Houston</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>In all our <placeName>Texas </placeName>affairs, as you are well apprised, I have felt it to be my
duty to be very cautions in involving the <persName>pioneers </persName>and actual <persName>settlers </persName>of
that <placeName>country</placeName>, by any act of mine, until I was fully and clearly convinced
of its necessity, and of the capabilities of our resources to sustain it. Hence
it is that I have been censured by some for being over cautious. Where the
fate of a whole people is in question, it is difficult to be over-cautious or
to be too prudent. Besides these general considerations, there are others
which ought to have weight with me individually. I have been, either
directly or indirectly, the cause of drawing many <persName>families </persName>to <placeName>Texas</placeName>; also,
the situation and circumstances in which I have been placed have given
considerable weight to my opinions. This has thrown a heavy 
responsibility upon me, so much so that I have considered it to be my duty to be
prudent, and even to control my own impulses and feelings; these have
long been impatient under the state of things which has existed in <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
and in favor of a speedy and radical change. But I have never approved
of the course of forestalling public opinion by party or partial meetings,
or by management of any kind. The true course is to lay facts before the
<persName>people</persName>, and let them judge for themselves. I have endeavored to pursue
this course.</p>

<p>A question of vital importance is yet to be decided by <placeName>Texas</placeName>, which is a
declaration of independence. When I left <placeName>Texas </placeName>I was of opinion that it
was premature to stir this question, and that we ought to be very cautious
of taking any steps that would make the <placeName>Texas </placeName>war purely a national war,
which would unite all <persName>parties </persName>against us, instead of it being a <persName>party </persName>war,
which would secure to us the aid of the <persName>federal party</persName>. In this I acted<pb n="299"/>
contrary to my own impulses, for I wish to see <placeName>Texas </placeName>free from the 
trammels of religious intolerance and other anti-republican restrictions, and 
independent at once; and as an individual have always been ready to risk my
all to obtain it; but I could not feel justifiable in precipitating and 
involving others until I was fully satisfied that they would be sustained. Since
my arrival here, I have received information which has satisfied me on this
subject. I have no doubt we can obtain all and even much more aid than
we need. I now think the time has come for <placeName>Texas </placeName>to assert her natural
rights; and were I in the convention I would urge an immediate declaration
of independence. I form this opinion from the information now before me.
I have not heard of any movement in the <placeName>interior </placeName>by the <persName>federal party</persName>, in
favor of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, or of the constitution; on the contrary the information from
<placeName>Mexico </placeName>is that all <persName>parties </persName>are against us, owing to what has already been
said and done in <placeName>Texas </placeName>in favor of independence; and that we have nothing
to expect from that quarter but hostility. I am acting on this information.
If it be true, and I have no reason to doubt it, our present position in
favor of the republican principles of the constitution of <date n="xx-xx-1824">1824</date>, can do us no
good, and it is doing us harm by deterring those kind of men from joining
us that are most useful. I know not what information you may have in
<placeName>Texas </placeName>as to the movements of the <persName>federal party</persName> in our favor, nor what 
influence they ought to have on the decision of this question, this being a
matter which the convention alone can determine; I can only say that, with
the information now before me, I am in favor of an immediate declaration
of independence. <persName>Santa Anna</persName> was at <placeName>San Luis Potosi</placeName> according to the last
accounts, marching on rapidly with a large <persName>force </persName>against <placeName>Texas</placeName>. We must
be united and firm, and look well to the month of <date n="03-xx-1836">March</date>&#8212;and be ready.
I shall try to be at <placeName>home </placeName>by that time. Yours, respectfully,</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>.</p>
