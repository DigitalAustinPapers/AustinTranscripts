<p>Letter from <persName>Genl Stephen F Austin</persName> to <persName>Capt. Henry Austin</persName> Dated <placeName>Velasco</placeName>
<date when="1836-06-27">June 27 1836</date> &#8212; Dear Sir&#8212;<placeName>Texas </placeName>needs every man who belongs here&#8212;the
war is not ended&#8212; The armistice that was commenced and made on the
battle ground of <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> by <persName>Houston </persName>with the <hi rend="italic"><persName>prisoner </persName></hi><persName>Santa Anna</persName>,
saved the mass of the <persName>Mexican Army</persName>, as it gave to them the permission to
retreat unmolested and take away all their arms etc&#8212; <persName>Genl. Cortazar</persName> has
reached <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>by the last accounts with the <persName>army of reserve</persName>, previously
formed by <persName>Santa Anna</persName>&#8212;(this army was to push his conquests to the 
<placeName>Mississippi</placeName>) and before this has no doubt reached <placeName>the del Norte</placeName>&#8212; <placeName>Texas </placeName>is
now better prepared for war then she was before&#8212;the retreat or rather
flight of <persName>families </persName><date n="Spring-1836">last spring</date> has taught that it is better to die in battle&#8212;
than to suffer a hundred deaths by the exposure and fatigue of flight&#8212; it
has also taught grumblers etc that there is more safety in the rifle and
musket, than in useless and vindictive criticisms and party animosity and
selfishness&#8212; In short, I believe that the <persName><hi rend="italic">people </hi>of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> are <hi rend="italic">now </hi>
determined to stand their ground and to conquer or die upon it&#8212; I hope you
will return immediately and if you can bring some men do so, but no
delay&#8212;and do try and impress it on those who come with you&#8212;if any
come&#8212;that they cannot be <persName>Generals</persName>, <persName>Colonels</persName>, <persName>Majors </persName>etc.</p>

<p>My <persName>sister </persName>came down here the other day to embark for <placeName>Orleans</placeName>, but the
vessel did not sail&#8212; I have not yet seen her&#8212; I shall advise her to stay at
home and abide the fate of <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212; You will say to this that she can be
of no avail here&#8212;not so&#8212;it was the panic caused by the flight of <persName>families</persName>
<date n="Spring-1836">last spring</date> which came so near loosing <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and if <hi rend="italic">my </hi><persName>sister </persName>goes, it will
have its influence on many others&#8212;I wish all of my name or connection to
stay in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and abide the issue be it what it may&#8212; Your <persName>children </persName>ought
to and must remain where they are in <placeName>Lexington </placeName>but <hi rend="italic">you </hi>ought to be here
Bring me a sword I had several, but in my absence they are all 
scattered&#8212;, The <persName>cabinet </persName>have managed to excite popular prejudice against
them by entering into any arrangements with <persName>Santa Anna</persName>&#8212; It was most
unfortunate&#8212;those arrangements however were begun by <persName>Houston </persName>on the
<placeName>battle ground</placeName> the <date when="1836-04-22">day after <persName>Santa Anna</persName> was taken</date>&#8212; The <persName>cabinet </persName>are not to
blame&#8212;so much as they have been blamed <placeName>Texas </placeName>was saved by the 
victory of <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> and almost lost by the armistice made in the moment<pb n="372"/>
of victory with a <persName>prisoner</persName>&#8212; An immediate and rapid advance after that
victory would have distroyed the whole of the <persName>Mexican army</persName>&#8212; But that
is passed and ought only to be alluded to now, to draw lessons from 
experience and not for vituperation&#8212;, experience tells us all, stand your ground,
fight it out, and trust to no armistice except one of two kinds&#8212;a final peace
&#8212;or death&#8212; Farewell Love to <persName>cousin Mary</persName> and the <persName>children </persName>Yours
most affectionately and truly</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
