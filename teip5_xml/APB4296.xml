<p>My Dear Sir<persName> Col. Butler </persName>advises me of the receipt of a letter
from you, communicating the painful intelligence of the Death
of My <persName>Ex. Partner S. J. Willson,</persName> and of a protracted illness with
which you had suffered; But it afforded me pleasure to hear of
your convalesance and hope e'er this you have regained good health,<pb n="724"/>
so necessary to enable us to enjoy the temporal blessings of a short
life</p>

<p><persName>Willson </persName>as you may have learned has been owing me for some
time, say since <date n="xx-xx-1828">1828 </date>a large sum, of money drawn from my resources
while he was a <persName>partner </persName>and in my absence; no part of which I have
been able to get of him directly tho I have succeeded in collecting
for his a/c here and elsewhere some small amounts compared with
principal debt; and I now feel confident he has left Something with
which to make on abono if nothing more, and with the hope of
having a favourable result, forward this day to <persName>Thos. J. Chambers
Esqr.</persName> of your place. My a/c current up to date having a balance
without interest in my favour of $21,201-20/100&#8212; With a carta
poder; to examine into the matter and to recover for me, what he
can, tho I am personally acquainted with<persName> Mr. Chambers</persName> I would
feel much obliged to you to recommend the matter to him in a
special manner.</p>

<p>When you have leisure, I would thank you to advise me, if I have
any chance, to get hold of his grant tho I am half interested in it,
of this however no document exists other than his letters,</p>

<p><persName>W. S. Parrott </persName>   [Rubric]</p>
