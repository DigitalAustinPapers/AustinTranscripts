<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>Enclosed is the permit which I issue to <placeName>settlers</placeName>, you can use the
same form,&#8212;</p>

<p>I wrote you that I did not wish you to risk anything in this 
enterprise, if you can conveniently Ship Some Corn, or Shorts, or Flour
to <persName>Joseph H. Hawkins</persName> it will help, also if the <persName>Blacksmith </persName>or any
other kind of tools were saved at the <placeName>mines </placeName>send them, also 
everything belonging to the <placeName>estate at Little Rock</placeName> with my books etc.&#8212;</p>

<p>If <persName>H Elliott</persName> will come on I think I can benefit him, but I shall not
wate for him or any other of my <persName>friends </persName>in your country, neither
shall I advise them to come&#8212;they must take their own course&#8212;if they
come to me, I will do for them all I can, but if others who are on
the ground apply for any appointment in my power to procure I
shall get it for them if I can without delay&#8212;I sent <persName>Brother Brown</persName> a
Spanish Grammar he must borrow a Dictionary at <placeName>St. Louis</placeName> and
apply himself to study&#8212;he ought to go out with some good <persName>surveyor</persName>
as <hi rend="italic"><persName>chain carrier</persName></hi> if no better can be done, so as to learn the art of
surveying, he will find it of use in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and he must now learn to
<hi rend="italic">work</hi>,&#8212;he had better employ himself in this manner untill I get
things under way&#8212;</p>

<p>If any of you write to me direct to the care of <persName>Ambroise Sampyrac</persName>
<placeName>Nachitoches </placeName><hi rend="italic">and pay the postage</hi>, or I shall not get the letters.</p>

<p>I leave here the <date when="1821-11-25">day after tomorrow</date>, and the vessel sails the same
clay&#8212;it will probably be one year before I return to the <placeName>U States</placeName>,
in the mean time take care of our Dear <persName>Mother</persName>, and make no 
calculations on me, or <placeName>Texas </placeName>until I get better under way in that country&#8212;
Send on as many <persName>settlers </persName>of good character as you can&#8212;I have no
doubt of success and think that all who join me will do well, but I
advice no one to come, no man shall reproach me for leading him
into difficulty should things result badly&#8212;</p>

<p>Give my love to <persName>Mother </persName>and <persName>Sister </persName>and <persName>Brother</persName>- I wrote them a
few days since and sent <persName>Mother </persName>some opium by <persName>Honey </persName>in the Dolphin
also to <persName>Uncle Austin</persName> and <persName>family</persName>&#8212;<pb n="435"/></p>

<p><persName>Honey </persName>wishes <persName>mother </persName>to live with him.   on this subject she must
do as circumstances require, he will furnish everything&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S F. Austin</persName></p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. James Bryan</persName> <placeName>Herculaneum Missouri</placeName></p>
