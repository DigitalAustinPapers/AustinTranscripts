<p>Sir</p>

<p>The <placeName>State of Texas</placeName> have appointed Messrs____and myself <persName>Commissioners</persName>
for the purpose of procuring the Loan of One Million of Dollars, upon the
pledge of its resources&#8212;at an interest not Exceeding Eight per cent, for a
Term not less than 5 Years and redeemable thereafter at the pleasure of
that <placeName>State </placeName>at the rate of 1/5 annually&#8212;and if not so redeemed, then after
10 years redeemable wholly after six Months notice&#8212;</p>

<p>The Stock May from the first be Made likewise receivable partially in
payment of Imports&#8212;Say 1/5 on any Invoice&#8212;also in payment for Lands,
Say 1/5 from any <persName>purchaser</persName>&#8212;these provisions will create a demand that
will tend constantly to augment the current price of these securities&#8212;
The duties are now $100,000 and boldly encrease&#8212; and the <placeName>Land </placeName>sales
May reach $1,000,000 soon and annually&#8212;</p>

<p>By the advice of <persName>friends </persName>I ask your consideration of this Subject and
wish you would inquire into probability of our succeeding in this <placeName>country</placeName>
in Making such a Loan. I am going to <placeName>New York</placeName> where I shall be glad to
receive an answer from you as early [as] you shall find it practicable to
reply with any degree of precision</p>

<p>The <persName>Commissioners of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> propose to negociate a loan for the 
<persName>Government</persName>, for the sum of $500,000 on the following Basis.</p>

<p>The <persName>Commrs </persName>hold the Bonds of said <persName>Govt</persName>, for the sum of $500,000
payable in 10 years at 8 per cent annual interest, which they propose to
assign to the <placeName>Bank of the United States</placeName> to be held in trust and as security
for the Stock to be issued for a like amount, payable in the Same Period,
and at the same rate of interest.</p>

<p>The stock shall be issued in shares of $100 each payable in 10 years
from date, with interest payable annually at 8 per cent, at such place, as
said stock shall be subscribed, said scrip shall be received also in payment
of one fifth of all monies due by the <persName>holders </persName>at the <placeName>land offices of Texas</placeName>,
and in payment of one fifth of all imposts due at the <placeName>custom houses of
Texas</placeName>, and at the end of five years the <persName>Government </persName>shall have the privilege
of redeeming one fifth of the remainder annually, and at the expiration of<pb n="328"/>
10 years of redeeming the remainder (if any there be) on giving 6 months
notice.</p>

<p>Books of subscription shall be opened for said stock, and the <persName>subscribers</persName>
shall pay 25% at the time of subscription, and notes for the remainder in
three equal payments at 6, 90 and 120 days, endorsed to the satisfaction of
the <persName>Directors of the U. S. Bank</persName>, or persons appointed by them to decide,
and the <placeName>Bank </placeName>shall discount said notes, and pay the first payment, and the
proceeds of notes to the <persName>Commissioners</persName>.</p>
