Strang</persName> to be Correct I am certain he would not state any thing but
what was true the <persName>Settlers</persName> on the<placeName> East of the San Jacinto</placeName> is 
unanimous to Continue in your <placeName>Collony</placeName> they are willing to sine any
Pe[ti]tion for that purpose if you are willing to accept us in your

<placeName>South East</placeName> the Vessel Drifting with one Anchor we put the Cabose
out with the small lower Cable it held her a few ours she again
Drifted and commenced thumping <persName>Capt. Carrico</persName> Asked my Advice
what was best to do I told him if I give my advice I might be rong

he did not liked it he could let it alone I told him as he had been
taulcking of Riming Hir a ground and some times of Cutting a way
the Masts if he would now slip the Cable and hoist Sail it was most
likely we could get hir thru the <placeName>Pass of Red fish bar</placeName> and if we could
I could bring her into the <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> and lay her safe a long the
banck he then gave orders to slip the Cable Maicking sail the
Schooner by this time was so fast a ground she would not mind her
helm <persName>Capt. Carrico</persName> then gave orders to hoist all the sail we could and

assisted in every thing he wanted to be don we don the most of the
pumping the Vessel being very leaky</p>
