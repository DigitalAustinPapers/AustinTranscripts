<p><placeName>Station at Labaca </placeName><date when="1827-04-03">April 3rd 1827</date>.</p>
<p>Dr sir</p>

<p>I am happy to hear of your return and hope your visit to 
<placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>has, and will result in much good to the <placeName>Country</placeName>.</p>

<p>We have lately had 2 visits to our <placeName>station </placeName>of the <persName>Coronkawases</persName>;
the first part had six, and the [second] twelve in number, they
professed great friendship to us and actually had it in their power
to have killed several of our <persName>people</persName>, as they came <placeName>up to the station</placeName>;
for they found one <persName>man </persName>and 2 <persName>boys </persName><placeName>10 miles below here</placeName> at work,
and actually were in their <placeName>camp </placeName>in a manner&#8212;before they were 
discovered;<placeName> a few miles above that</placeName> they came to another labor in like
manner where there were a <persName>man </persName>and a <persName>woman</persName>; and hurt no one but
I am of opinion that they are only waiting a good opportunity to
make a break on our <placeName>settlement</placeName>, therefore we are constantly upon
our Guard; and so soon as we get our corn planted we will try to be
ready for them, and are determined that they must not come amongst
us&#8212;for since we have heard of the late murders in your <placeName>colony </placeName>it
is more than <persName>Americans </persName>can hear to suffer them to come under the
coulor of friendship when their hands are yet reeking with the blood
of Inosent <persName>women </persName>and <persName>children</persName>; and as we expect a campaign against
them from your <placeName>quarter</placeName>, I have thought it most advisable to keep
peace with them if possible untill that time; and being advised of<pb n="1625"/>
the time we can have it in our power to know where they are and
can give you 15 or 20 good brave <persName>men </persName>to assist in cuting them entirely
off. and If a Campaign is intended please to let me know that I
may know how to act.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Kerr</persName> is at <placeName>la Bahia</placeName>, but looked for every hour. I had news
from <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>yesterday 2 <placeName>Blockhouses </placeName>are well built and now
under the Command of <persName>Mr. Byrd Lockhart</persName>; all are in peace at that
place; and no <persName>Indian </persName>sign near that is known of.</p>

<p><persName>Mr Monchola</persName> has not sent the ballance of my guns to me and the
<persName>individuals </persName>who own them, altho he has been ordered to do so and
it is greatly to the hurt of the <persName>owners </persName>as they want them to hunt
their meat as well as to guard themselves with.</p>

<p>Please write me and give me the news, as <persName>Mr Kerr</persName> and myself
are both anxious to hear from the <placeName>N Eastward</placeName> and <placeName>S westward,</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>G Dewitt </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>P. S. Give the earliest notice you can if a <persName>campaign </persName>is intended
against the <persName>Corronks</persName>, that we may have time to prepare to Join you&#8212;¦</p>

<p><persName>G. D.</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName> <placeName>San Felipe de Austin Brassos
</placeName>per <persName>Capt Russell</persName></p>
