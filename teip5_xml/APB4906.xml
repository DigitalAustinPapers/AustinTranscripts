<p><placeName>San Felipe</placeName> <date when="1835-10-03">Oct. 3. 1835</date></p>

<p>I have this moment recd your letters dated <date when="1835-10-01">1st instant</date>&#8212;</p>

<p>The communications which were taken <date when="1835-10-02">yesterday </date>by <persName>Mr Lightfoot</persName>, and
today by <persName>Mr Perkins</persName>, will have informed you fully of the attack made on
<placeName>Gonzales</placeName>, and that <persName>voluntiers </persName>from <placeName>every part of this country</placeName> have marched
and are marching to <placeName>that point</placeName>, which is at present the <placeName>general rendezvous
of the <persName><hi rend="italic">army of the people</hi></persName></placeName>&#8212; <persName>Expresses </persName>have been sent to <placeName>Trinity </placeName>and to
<placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, and a <persName>large force</persName> is expected from <placeName>that quarter</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>The campaign is opened, and it must not be closed untill <placeName>Bexar </placeName>is taken
and all the <persName>military </persName>are driven out of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>A report reached here that the <persName>voluntiers from <placeName>Colombia</placeName></persName> who were to
rendezvous at <placeName><persName>Kerr</persName>s</placeName> had been turned back, in consequence of news received
by them from <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>&#8212;in consequence of which I dispatched an 
<persName>express </persName>to <placeName>Colombia </placeName>on receipt of the news of the attack on <placeName>Gonzales</placeName>&#8212; I also
dispatched the same to <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>, and <date when="1835-10-02">yesterday </date>to <placeName>La Baca.</placeName></p>

<p>Correct information, as to <persName>Cos</persName>'s movements, and concert between 
<placeName>Gonzales </placeName>and <placeName>La Baca</placeName> is very important&#8212; It is possible that <persName>Cos </persName>may attempt
a forced march to <placeName>this place</placeName> from <placeName>Goliad</placeName>, in the absence of the<persName> men at
<placeName>Gonzales</placeName></persName>.</p>

<p>It would be well to keep this idea in view and to obtain certain 
information, when he left <placeName>Goliad</placeName>, and where the <persName><placeName>Morelos </placeName>Battalion</persName> have stopped&#8212;
whether they went on to <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, or have remained at <placeName>Goliad</placeName>&#8212; I expect the<pb n="153"/>
<persName>men from <placeName>Harrisburg</placeName></persName> will be on by <date when="1835-10-04">to-morrow</date> or <date when="1835-10-05">next day </date>to <placeName>this place</placeName>,
and unless otherwise advised they will continue on to <placeName>Gonzales</placeName></p>

<p>I regret that there are no Guns to be had in <placeName>this quarter</placeName> for the supply of
<persName>Capt. Aliens company</persName>. There is public powder at <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>which you
can get by applying for in my name to the <persName>committee of that place</persName>, as they
informed me they would hold it subject to my order.</p>

<p>I shall dispatch <persName>expresses </persName>with the information contained in your letters,
to <placeName>every part of the upper and eastern country</placeName>. I presume you have of
course informed them in <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>and <placeName>Bay Prairie</placeName> from which it will go
to <placeName>Colombia</placeName>.</p>

<p>There are some who <hi rend="italic">will not yet believe</hi> that <persName>Genl. Cos</persName> has come on&#8212;
send all the <hi rend="italic">positive </hi>information you can on this subject in a letter signed
by <persName>James Kerr</persName>, <persName>John Alley</persName>, <persName>George Sutherland</persName>, or some others who are
well known, in order that it may be printed with the signatures&#8212;
The <placeName>printing press</placeName> will be ready to print in this place <date when="1835-10-04">to-morrow&#8212;</date>you
can therefore send me what you wish to have published&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName> [Rubric]</p>
<p>To <persName>James Kerr</persName> and <persName>John Alley</persName>&#8212;</p>
