<p><persName>Col Austin</persName></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I wrote you from <placeName>Camargo </placeName>by <persName>Colnl Milim</persName>; that it was impossible
for me a while yet to visit your <placeName>Colony</placeName>; owing to my business, and
now I must say, it will be some time longer; but I hope this will
not interfeer with the Tittle to my land; Indead the <persName>General</persName>, <persName>Priest</persName>,
and <persName>Alcalde</persName>, in this place all voluntary offered to give me certificates
that, I have been constantly a <persName>Citizen </persName>of the <placeName>State</placeName>.&#8212;</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you that I have found in this <placeName>Town </placeName>one
<persName>Enemy </persName>to your <placeName>Colony</placeName>; and more sorry when that <persName>Enemy </persName>goes under<pb n="1331"/>
the name of an <persName>American</persName>; A <persName>George Nixon</persName> who is well known to
you from the disturbance he tryd to make when on the <placeName>Rio Brazos</placeName>;
and who has taken particular pains to shew me all the documents,
in order to draw me to his side.&#8212;</p>

<p>He has now become more dangerous, the "Woolf has put on the
sheeps Clothing", he got babtized in this place the other day, and
with these people his word will have more weight he has tryd very
hard here with the <persName>General </persName>and <persName>Priest </persName>to represent your Conduct
in a bad light; and more particularly with the <persName>Priest</persName>, whose <persName>Uncle</persName>
is one of the <persName>Secretaries of the department of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> (the <persName>Priest </persName>is
my particular <persName>friend</persName>) and I think a <persName>Gentleman</persName>, and a <persName>man of 
Education</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Nixon</persName> speaks very bad Spanish, worse than I do, and in that
respect I have a preponderent ascendency over him, which I have
made use of, feeling it my duty, as well as my interest to promote
the Prosperity of the <placeName>Colony</placeName>, and have thereby warded off the Edge
of his malignance here, and set your Conduct in its proper light.&#8212;</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty to give you this information, should it be
beneficial to you it will give me pleasure.&#8212;depend upon all my 
influence, and exertion, for the protection and welfare of the <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>James Grant</persName>.</p>
