<p>Sir On the subject of a conversation I had with you at this place
I beg leave to have liberty of submitting the following observations to
your consideration and remarks thereon&#8212;</p>

<p>Having reported myself to you with a wish to become a <persName>settler </persName>but
from various adverse occurrences in my business has as yet prevented
My making a permanent settlement in your <placeName>colony</placeName>, although I have
made a selection of Land partly in yours and in <persName>leftwicks </persName>but from
an interruption in the <placeName>settlement </placeName>on the land by the <persName>indians </persName>I have
changed my views which can only be realised by your approbation.
To constitute the plan I would propose to select a <placeName>League of land
</placeName>for Myself <placeName>adjoining some of your reserve lands</placeName> most properly
adapted to the cultivation of sugar Cane that you would add a <placeName>league
of your land</placeName> or more if thought necessary to effect the purpose; that
complete Titles be made out to satisfy any person that it would be
proper to make interrested in order to raise a fund sufficient to 
accomplish the establishment of <placeName>sugar Manufactory</placeName> upon a respectable
scale, If funds in <persName>negro slaves </persName>and mony could be obtained by a
sale of the land before named It would certainly be favorable, but if
not to make some <persName>capitalists </persName>Interrested who would be willing to<pb n="1609"/>
invest for that purpose, If neither of the foregoing plans would be
easily obtained raise such a fund out of said land in either of the
proposed ways as would effect the establishment out of the Labour
of <persName>free people of Color</persName>, as would I believe be cheaper and much
easier effected by holding out inducements to them after the term
of their service would expire if it had been faithfully accomplished,
such for instance as a labour [labor] or any other quantity Allowed
by government to such <persName>men of good habits</persName>&#8212;A question may arise on
the policy or legallity of introducing the last named class of <persName>servants</persName>
this sir is entirely submitted to you as the Legitimate organ of the
Government by whom I am to be officially informed on that subject
and every other regulation necessary to be observed in the 
introduction whether by land or water whether certificates of character and
generaly what would be the requisite formality to be observed by the
inporter etc</p>

<p>Plan of the Project</p>

<p>Yourself <placeName>two Leagues</placeName> that May in the Eastern Market Either in goods
or money be worth $1 pr. A___________________________________$9000 00</p>
<p>
Myself <placeName>One League</placeName>&#8212;-"_________________________________________   4500 00</p>

and <persName>women </persName>delivered at <placeName>Brasos </placeName>each 400$____________________$8000.00</p>

<p>Leaving this sums to buy land and pay cont.   Expences Care tools $60-   5500. 00</p>

<p>13, 500.00</p>
<p>To remove <persName>freemen </persName>and <persName>women </persName>It might Probably Cost to
deliver 80 the sum of__________________________________8000. 00</p>

<p>Left to Apply to other Expence__________________________5500</p>

<p>13, 500.00</p>
