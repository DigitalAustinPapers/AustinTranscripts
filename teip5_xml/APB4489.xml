<p>Dr. Sir Your esteemed favour of <date when="1832-11-01">Nov 1st</date> has come to hand, It
gives me great pleasure to find that you are so faithfull to your
promise of detailing the various affairs of our <placeName>adopted country</placeName>&#8212;
Such is the difficulty in winding up a ten years unsettled business that
it will be impossible for me to leave the <placeName>United  States</placeName> before<pb n="897"/>
<date n="09-xx-1833">September next</date> I allso will have to make a trip to <placeName>Virginia </placeName>for the
purpose of adding to my stock of <persName>Slaves </persName>which will take up so much
of my time that I cannot Start sooner than the period mentioned
You may look with a great deal of certainty for many of your old
<persName>acquaintances </persName>in <placeName>Texas </placeName><date n="Spring - 1833">next Spring</date> the Spirit for emigration to
that <placeName>Country </placeName>is very great and thousands would go but for the 
terrors of a <persName>Mexican government</persName> these idle fears I have endeavored
as much as possible to allay and I belive with much success except
with some of the more timid. You mentioned in your last letter
that you belived <placeName>Mexican grants of Eleven leagues</placeName> could be procured
for a reasonable sum if so you will perceve by the enclosed proposition
that <persName>Mr Edward Hanrick George Whitman and myself</persName> are 
disposed to procure some of them the Selections of which will be left
entirely to your own discretion and should you be disposed to take
up with the proposition I feel satisfied that we will be well pleased
with your selections In consequence of the disturbances in <placeName>Texas</placeName>
the <persName>Messrs Prichards</persName> have declined their journey untill another year
<persName>Mr Beard</persName> and <persName>Thompson </persName>have started to <placeName>Texas </placeName>and no doubt will
arrive ere this</p>

<p>The Political news of the<placeName> United States</placeName> is that <persName>Jackson </persName>has been
re-ellected <persName>President </persName>by an overwhelming <persName>majority</persName>&#8212; <placeName>South 
Carolina</placeName> has nullified the Tariff acts; which is to take place in<date n="02-xx-1833"> February
next</date>, provided <persName>Congress </persName>does not abandon the protection system by
that time and in case of any interference on the part of the <placeName>united
states</placeName> to enforce the laws She has declared her determination to
Secede we expect stormy times in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, perhaps
civil war which God avert Your brother <persName>Michael Williamson</persName> died
a few weeks ago and <persName>Col Peacock </persName>has taken <placeName>home </placeName>his <persName>widow </persName>and
<persName>children</persName>&#8212;</p>
