<p><placeName>Halls Bayou </placeName><date when="1832-08-05">August 5, 1832</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. Perry</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir, I am just from <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>where on <date when="1832-08-03">Friday morning</date> I
saw <persName>Captain John Austin</persName> who had just returned from <placeName>Anahac</placeName>
reports that the <placeName>Fort </placeName>at that place was dismantled and the <persName>Troops</persName>
embarked for the <placeName>westward </placeName>and the <persName>fleet </persName>gone back to <placeName>Matamoros</placeName>,
<persName>Colonel Mexia</persName> had not marched on <placeName>Nachidoch </placeName>on account of the<pb n="832"/>
scarcity of provisions nor had he heard from them he however
left it with the <persName>Americans </persName>to send <persName>Col. Pedras </persName>on to the <placeName>Westward</placeName>
a <persName>prisoner</persName>, to take him without bloodshed if possible, if not, to use
forca Poor <persName>Bradburn </persName>had crossed the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>. There were eight
<persName>men </persName>in pursuit of him and had come so close upon him that they
had got his Horse, he swam the <placeName>river above the ferry</placeName> and had got
on <placeName>eight miles beyond</placeName> on foot, the men still in persuit and it was
supposed had overtaken him, <persName>Captain Austin</persName> learned that at the time
the <persName>Americans </persName>were before <placeName>Anahac </placeName>There were four <persName>Mexicans</persName>
<persName>killed </persName>and four <persName>wounded</persName>, The <persName>troops </persName>from two or three other
<placeName>stations </placeName>had commenced their march to the <placeName>westward</placeName>. Have you
heard of the death of <persName>Mrs. Henry Austin</persName>? she died on <date when="1832-08-02">Thursday</date>
morning and was buryed the <date when="1832-08-03">following day</date>, <persName>Captain Austin</persName> was
very much afflicted with his loss, <persName>Mr Jimmison of <placeName>Brazoria</placeName></persName> died
early last week and there was much sickness in and about the <placeName>Town</placeName>.
We may congratulate ourselves on good health out here if nothing
else, <persName>Mr Harris</persName> informed me as I passed there <date when="1832-08-04">last evening </date>that a
<persName>Gentleman </persName>right from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> had passed there and reports that
a terible <persName>Indian </persName>War had broken out about <placeName>Rock Island on the
upper Mississippi</placeName> and the <placeName>borders of Indiana</placeName>, considerable fighting
had taken place and that the <persName>Indians </persName>had committed a great deal of
mischief in the Murdering of <persName>families</persName>. It seems that a good many
<persName>tribes </persName>had joined in the war, such as the <persName>Winibagas </persName><persName>Sock </persName>and <persName>Foxes</persName>,
<persName>Soux </persName>etc.</p>

<p><persName>Henry Morse</persName></p>

<p>Should you learn that <persName>Col. Austin</persName> does not intend to visit you
and a chance offers to send him my letter I would be glad you would
do so&#8212;</p>

<p>[Address:]<persName> Mr James F. Perry</persName>   <placeName>Oak Grove</placeName></p>
