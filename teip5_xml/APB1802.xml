<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir Your esteemed favor of the <date when="1829-10-12">12 Oct </date>came to hand by
<persName>Captain Pettet</persName> and for the valuable information therein contained
be pleased to accept my warmest thanks, I have shown your letter to
several of my <persName>friends </persName>who are interested in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and they have 
advised me verry Strongly to have it published, this I have declined
doing, as you had [not] expressed such a wish. Your letter has
shed light on the subject of the Colonization Laws and regulations.<pb n="295"/>
which many <persName>persons </persName>stood in need of and to such <persName>persons </persName>I have
taken pleasure in reading it. I shall feel under much obligation to
you when I receive the promised translation of all the Laws on
that subject as it will afford me the means of giving such 
information as is almost daily asked of me, as the <persName>representative of the
Mexican Government</persName> in this <placeName>City</placeName>. The impression is rapidly
spreading that the <placeName>United States</placeName> are now negotiating for the 
purchase of <placeName>Texas </placeName>it may be without foundation, but it has already
had the effect to cause many to look in that direction for a future
<placeName>residence</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>for your friendly feelings in recommending the <persName>Planters of your
-<placeName>Country </placeName></persName>to me as an <persName>agent </persName>to Transact their business accept my
best wishes, and you may rely on my best exertions for the 
protection of their Interest whenever intrusted to my care;</p>

<p>Should it ever fall in my way to render Service to the <placeName>Settlement
of Austin</placeName>, rest assured it Shall be done</p>

<p><persName>J W Breedlove</persName></p>

<p>P. S. A <persName>friend </persName>of mine <persName>Genl Smith</persName> of <placeName>Missouri </placeName>is now here, and
has a great wish to make a contract with your <placeName>State </placeName>for the 
Settlement of two or three hundred <persName>families</persName>, and wishes me to Join him,
he is a <persName>Gentleman </persName>of great Integrity and inteligence, and is in 
possession of Considerable means, he would visit <placeName>Texas</placeName>, but his 
business Calls him to <placeName>Mo</placeName>. he requests me to ask <placeName>if the land originally
granted to <persName>Edwards </persName></placeName>is vacant and also what Kind of a <placeName>Grant </placeName>Could
be obtained in other <placeName>Sections of your State</placeName>, and when your 
<persName>Legislature </persName>meets, and what are the requisites to be Done to make a 
Contract,   your answer to those enquiries will oblige</p>

<p><persName>J W Breedlove</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed.] <persName>Col. Stephen F Austin</persName> <placeName>Austin Texas</placeName> Schr.
