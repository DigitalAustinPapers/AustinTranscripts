<p><placeName>Austin </placeName><date when="1834-07-24">24th July. [1834.]</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>The mail brought but little information beyond <placeName>Monclova   </placeName>There
they have made a (pronuncimento) by which they declare that the<pb n="1065"/>
acts of the <persName>Genl Govt </persName>will not be recognized until <persName>Congress </persName>shall
be installed&#8212;It seems that <persName>Congress </persName>and <persName>Santa Ana</persName> got into 
collision with each other both became violent, he insisting that they
had adjourned and they declaring that the Session would Still
continue. Thus things Stood, when they were expelled by an <persName>armed
force</persName>.&#8212;As far as I can learn the most respectable <placeName>States </placeName>have 
declared against the <persName>President </persName>and the general opinion seems to be that
he must fall.</p>

<p>Not one word in relation to <persName>Austin</persName>. <persName>Coln Almonte</persName> is here; he
is intelligent agreeable and apparently candid. He says that <persName>Austin</persName>
will be released soon. That the <persName>govt </persName>has been grossly imposed on
in relation to <placeName>Texas</placeName>. That it was Stated in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>that we were in a
State of open rebellion, and that he was dispatched for the purpose
of learning our true Situation that he finds the reports to be worse
than false and that his representation will be of the most favorable
character.</p>

<p>You will see him before he leaves <placeName>Texas</placeName>. <persName>Henry Smith</persName> is <hi rend="italic"><persName>Gefe
Politico</persName></hi>. <persName>Chambers </persName>has recd the appointment of <persName>Judge </persName>
(Temporary). My own prospects for that office I conceive by no means
flattering. But I shall give myself no trouble or uneasiness about it.
The <persName>people </persName>seem to be determined to run your name for <persName>Deputy</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Williamson</persName>, as I am informed would be glad to get his name in
nomination, but it cannot be done.</p>

<p>This whole <placeName>upper country</placeName> is exceedingly sickly; tho not many
deaths. I feel an intense anxiety to get home to see my <persName>wife </persName>my
<persName>children </persName>and my best of <persName>friends </persName>Besides I really feel some little
uneasiness about my health. I am well at present but they fall so
rapidly around me that it is Somewhat alarming.</p>

<p>I shall not be able to start down before the <date when="1834-08-01">first of August.</date> 
<persName>Clayton </persName>will certainly be hanged <date when="1834-07-25">tomorrow</date>. I am told he submits to his
fate with but little fortitude.</p>

<p>You will find enclosed a little note to <persName>Laura </persName>and yourself.</p>

<p><persName>Wm H Jack</persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>T. F. McKinney</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:]<persName> T. F. McKinney</persName> <placeName>Velasco </placeName>Care of <persName>Mims &amp; Sharp
</persName><placeName>Brazoria </placeName>who will forward it speedily</p>
