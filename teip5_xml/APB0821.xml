<p>Dear Friend.</p>

<p>I received your favor sometime last month by <persName>Mr. Kennady</persName>, and
this is the first opportunity I have had of writing you, by <persName>Mr House</persName>,
I have searched <placeName>Natchitoches </placeName>for the English Linen writing Paper
for you but cannot find any therefore thought Proper to send you
the best I Could find, such as our <persName>Parish judge</persName> uses for the want
of better, I likewise obtained a few sheats of our Printer of the
quality I think will suit you all I could get. he has a few large
sheats from two to three feet square which would do for Drawing
<placeName>Maps </placeName>if you should want any I will send it you or any thing you
may wish from our Place you shall have sent you on the first 
application. I have Inclosed an Recount of <persName>D. Marple</persName> Estate, you will
Pleas do the same you would do for your self with it. Concerning
the land on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, I have made my mind up and am Determined
to live in that country. I wish you would be good enough to
C[h]oose me a League of Land on the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>within thirty miles
of the <placeName>sea </placeName>if convenient to your arrangements. I think your 
Judgement would be Better than my own if I wase Present, you will
Pleas have it surveyed and you can draw on me for the surveying at
any time, if you should want some Merchandize I would get them
at the lowes Prices of this Place it would suit me better than to
Pay the money as money is verry scarce here indeed. I will have
the Place cultivated next year by some good Person to Rais me a
good crop of corn etc etc</p>

<p>I have sent you a number of <placeName>News Papers</placeName> and some of Late dates
you will see the Departure of <persName>Itrabide Late emperor of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> from
<placeName>South Hampton England</placeName> for <placeName>Mexico </placeName>in <placeName>Niles Register</placeName> Inclosed
in the half Ream of Paper. I shall send as often as I can get
Opportunity Papers to you                    </p>

<p><persName>J Cable</persName></p>
