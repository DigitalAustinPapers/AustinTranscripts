<p><date when="1822-01-29">29th January 1822</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Brother</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I arrived here on the <date when="1822-01-28">28th</date> 1st. in company with <persName>H Elliot</persName> and three
young men who calculate to remain in the country if they meet with
sufficient encouragement I left home on the <date when="1821-12-16">16th of December</date> and
came on the <placeName>Nacogdosh </placeName>where I was in hopes of meeting with you
on your return from <placeName>N. Orleans</placeName>&#8212; my Journey&#8212; has been quite
tedious and <hi rend="italic">very </hi>unpleasant in some Respects which shall be 
explained in due time&#8212; When we arrived on this <placeName>River</placeName>&#8212; a few 
circumstances combined &#8212; induced <persName>Eliott </persName>to take a Canoe and 
proceed to the <placeName>Mouth of the River</placeName> in hopes of meeting with you&#8212;
which <hi rend="italic">he </hi>considers of <hi rend="italic">vast </hi>importance to you as well as himself&#8212;
the fact is he is fearful that <persName>Rob Andrews</persName> will&#8212; <hi rend="italic">by meeting with
you</hi>, blast the prospects he has of making a <hi rend="italic">princely fortune</hi>&#8212; which
he calculates on&#8212; he heard at <placeName>Mount Prairie</placeName> that <persName>Andrews </persName>had
started with the expectation of Surveying the Land and he has
pushed so hard&#8212; that absolutely one of his horses gave out&#8212;from
<hi rend="italic">that </hi>circumstance alone I shall remain here until I hear from you
<persName>Mr Eliott</persName> will leave his Tent and <persName>boy </persName>at this place until he either
meets with you&#8212; or gets information when he can&#8212; some 
disagreeable circumstances that have taken place on the way between
<persName>Eliott </persName>and myself Render my <hi rend="italic">situation </hi>somewhat unpleasant and I
am anxious to see you as soon as convenient I arrived at 
<placeName>Herculaneum </placeName>from <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>in <date n="10-xx-1821">October </date>and was taken with the Fever
which continued untill within a day or two before I started&#8212;
<persName>Mother </persName>was taken at the same time&#8212; but had recovered&#8212; partly
tho she was in low health&#8212; <persName>Sister </persName>was well and all your <persName>friends</persName>
generally&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Bartholomeu </persName>who will hand you this is a <hi rend="italic">steady</hi>&#8212; moral and
Industrious Young Man From <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Derby Connecticut</placeName></hi> he is an 
excellent Cooper by trade&#8212; he was to have been on with <hi rend="italic"><persName>Father</persName></hi>&#8212; and 
attended on him during his last Illness&#8212; I want to see you very much
and have much to say to you&#8212; when we do meet</p>
