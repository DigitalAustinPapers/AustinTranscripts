<p><placeName>Matamoros </placeName><date when="1831-04-18">18th April 1831</date></p>
<p><persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>

<p><placeName><hi rend="italic">Leona Vicario</hi></placeName></p>

<p>Dr Sir, Your favours of the <date when="1831-03-15">15th ulto</date> and <date when="1831-04-19">19th inst.</date> were duly 
received. The letters which you enclosed in the former, were 
transmitted to the <placeName>U. States</placeName> in compliance with your request.</p>

<p>It is truly gratifying to me, to learn, that there is yet, some 
prospect of defeating the Law; which the Hon. <persName>Legislature of your <placeName>State</placeName>
</persName>has attempted to pass; prohibiting <persName>Foreigners </persName>from the privilege of
retailing their merchandise a copy of which, you did me the honor
to transmit&#8212;for your politeness and attention, I beg leave to return
you my sincere thanks. If such a law as contemplated, should go
into effect, it would most unquestionably, militate materially against
the interest of my <placeName>countrymen</placeName>. Its practical operation would have
a similar tendency towards the <persName>natives </persName>generally. It would throw
the whole trade into the hands of a <hi rend="italic">few </hi><persName>capitalists</persName>; who, availing
themselves of the monopoly, could compel the <persName>consumers </persName>to pay
almost any price for their goods, that their consciences would permit
them to ask: in a few words it would benefit the few to the obvious
detriment of the <hi rend="italic">many</hi>. I have never understood that you was an
advocate of that law; nor has any such report been in circulation
here, your letter gave me the first report of its supposed existence.
The laudable effort made by your <persName>Legislature</persName>, in behalf of this <placeName>Port</placeName>,
will be duly appreciated by every <persName>friend </persName>of equal rights and free
trade. It is to be hoped, that the open hostility, manifested by the
<persName>citizens of <placeName>Vera Cruz</placeName></persName>, against the growing prosperity of this section,
may be tranquilized; and that the interested selfish motives, disclosed
in their application to the <persName>General Congress</persName> to close, the<placeName> Port of
Matamoros </placeName>may be responded to, in the language of denial.</p>

<p>The natural advantages, which this place possesses, in point of
health, over the <placeName>Southern Ports</placeName>; the superior facilities in the 
transportation of merchandise into the <placeName>interior</placeName>; its contiguity to the
<placeName>frontier</placeName>, and to the <placeName>U. S</placeName>.; and its importance as a <placeName>military port</placeName>,
claim the consideration and protection of the general Government.
Those common advantages to the <placeName>nation</placeName>, should not be easily yielded
by those entrusted with its affairs; nor sacrificed by the cupidity of
local jealosy, and self-aggrandizement.<pb n="648"/></p>

<p>I have been informed, from a <placeName>quarter </placeName>entitled to credit, that the
Commercial Treaty, concluded by the<persName> American Charge des Affaires
at Mexico,</persName> with this <persName>Government</persName>, has been ratified by the <persName>Senate of
the <placeName>U. States</placeName></persName>, that the <persName>American citizens</persName> are placed upon an equal
footing with those of the most favored <placeName>nation</placeName>; and that the principle
of reciprocity has been fully recognized and established, by the 
respective <persName>Governments</persName>.&#8212;by the next arrival I expect to receive that
document.</p>

<p>The latest accounts from <placeName>Europe</placeName>, represent the powers that be, in a
high state of excitement and commotion&#8212;A general war is 
anticipated on the <placeName>Continent</placeName>.</p>

<p>I have been confined to my room, by severe indisposition, for some
months past; in consequence of which, I have not replied to your
communication of the <date when="1831-03-15">15th ulto</date> until now, I herewith enclose you a
letter from <persName>capn Henry Austin</persName> of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>. He directed me to
enclose it under cover to some <persName>friend </persName>in <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>, as he apprehended
there would be danger of its being intercepted in its progress, 
provided it went to your address. I have therefore enclosed it to <persName>Mr.
Judah</persName>, an intelligent <persName>merchant </persName>of that place, and beg leave to 
recommend him to your particular attention and regard.</p>

<p><persName>D. W. Smith  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>
