<p>7 in the morning, <date when="1835-10-20">Oct. 20th- 1835</date></p>
<p><persName>Gen S. F. Austin</persName>,</p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>Since sealing my official of <date when="1835-10-19">last evening</date> and 5 o.c. <date when="1835-10-20">this morning</date>, a 
<persName>Deserter from <placeName>Bexar</placeName></persName> has been introduced to my <placeName>quarters </placeName>who says he lives<pb n="195"/>
in <placeName>Monterey</placeName>&#8212;that, he deserted <date when="1835-10-11">8 days ago</date>, intending to return <placeName>home</placeName>&#8212;
that, after leaving <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, he heard of the fall of <placeName>Goliad</placeName>, and turned his
course for this place. He states, that, all the <persName><placeName>Bexar </placeName>Troopes</persName> will join the
<persName>Americans</persName>, as soon as they present themselves; that, the <hi rend="italic"><persName>officers </persName></hi>and 
<hi rend="italic"><persName>infantry </persName></hi>want a <hi rend="italic">fight</hi>, but that the <persName>cavalry </persName>do not&#8212;that, when the <persName>men </persName>were
sent to <placeName>Gonzales </placeName>after the Cannon, they were paid only S3 ea. and drew
only a little corn.</p>

<p>He says there are <persName>300 infantry </persName>and <persName>400 cavalry </persName>there&#8212;one half of the
<persName>former convicts</persName>&#8212;that, <persName>Gen Cos</persName> was making no preparation whatever, for
defence, in the way of fortifying&#8212;that, there were 2 pieces of cannon on
the <placeName>western side of Town, <hi rend="italic">near </hi>the Church</placeName>; and 2 in the <placeName>Alimo</placeName>. <placeName>In the
Town</placeName>, his <persName>patrol </persName>is strong, <hi rend="italic">especially at night</hi>, both in <persName>cavalry</persName>, and 
<persName>infantry</persName>&#8212;that he keeps <persName>60 sentinels </persName>out during the night; besides <persName><hi rend="italic">four </hi>
cavalry scouts</persName>, of <persName>20 men</persName> each; that, there is great discontent among the 
<persName>inhabitants</persName>, who will almost unanimously join the <persName>Colonists</persName>, as soon as they
enter the place; that, <hi rend="italic"><persName>Ugartechea </persName></hi>and <hi rend="italic"><persName>Candela</persName></hi>, are the only <persName>Officers</persName>, 
remarkable for their antipathy against us&#8212; and <hi rend="italic">these</hi>, do every thing in their
power to stimulate the men to defend the place to the last extremity.</p>

<p><persName>Mr. Bracken</persName>, arrived here <date when="1835-10-19">last evening</date> from <placeName>Zacatacas</placeName>; who left there a
short time since; he says, that, a few days before he left that <placeName>City</placeName>, all the
<persName>troops </persName>except <persName>400</persName>, had been marched to <placeName>Guadalajara</placeName>, to oppose <persName>Alvarez</persName>,
who had won two important victories over <persName>Santanna's troops</persName>. That 4
<persName>Generals</persName>, amongst whom are, <persName>Montenegro </persName>and <persName>Guzman</persName>, had joined 
<persName>Alvarez </persName>and that he was daily acquiring strength; and further, that the
<persName>troops at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and <placeName>San Louis</placeName></persName>, destined for <placeName>Texas</placeName>, had been ordered
back, after having taken up the line of march.</p>

<p><date when="1835-10-20">9. o. c. same day</date>&#8212;<persName>Col. Powers</persName> this moment arrived from the 
neighbourhood of <placeName>San Patricio</placeName>; He states that the cannon there had been 
removed to the <placeName>garrison of Le Panticlan</placeName>, and that the <persName>troops </persName>there, were 
fortifying day and night. A <persName>courier </persName>had arrived there, who gave information
of the near approach of <persName>200 Cavalry </persName>from <placeName>Aquaverda </placeName>and <placeName>Loredo</placeName>, to the
<persName>garrison on the <placeName>Nueces</placeName></persName>; and that there were also from 2 to 300 more on the
march <placeName>from Matamoros to the Nueces</placeName>; intended for the recapture of this
<placeName>post</placeName>. This information comes through an <persName>express </persName>sent to the <persName>comt. of the
<placeName>Loredo </placeName>troops</persName>; who accidentally passed them, and reached the <placeName>Nueces</placeName>
without seeing them.</p>

<p><persName>Col. Powers</persName> further states that, <persName>Cos </persName>complains in a letter to the <persName>Com'g
officer at <placeName>Le Panticlan</placeName></persName>, that his <persName>whole force</persName>, including those on the way, is
only 1700. This <persName>Garrison </persName>has a <persName>Piquet of 15 or 20 men</persName>, <placeName>6 Leagues this
side Sn Patricio</placeName>; and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, about the same distance the other side, for 
forwarding <persName>expresses</persName>.<pb n="196"/></p>

<p>From all this, you can easily judge whether this place ought to be
evacuated, and whether <persName>50 men </persName>can make a successful defence.</p>
