<p><placeName>Goliad </placeName><date when="1835-10-13">13th Oct. 8 O'Clock P. M. 1835</date></p>
<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to ackuowledge the receipt of your Two 
Communications under date of the <date when="1835-10-11">11th </date>and <date when="1835-10-12">12th Inst</date>.</p>

<p>The <persName>Men who Compose the Bat[talion at]</persName> this place, were extremely 
unwilling to [remain here] and it was with difficulty on <date when="1835-10-12">yesterday </date>[they]
were prevailed upon to Stay until [orders] could be received from <placeName>head
quarters</placeName>.</p>

<p>The orders this day recvd were rea[d] and they have concented to stay
with [but few] Exceptions, to defend this place to the [last] extremety<pb n="180"/></p>

<p>It will be imposseble for Me to Comply with your Orders Contained in
yours of the <date when="1835-10-12">12th Inst</date>, farther than that of defending the place because we
have but a <hi rend="italic">verry few</hi> more <persName>Men </persName>than you order to remain and no 
Munitions of war which could possibly be Spared and besides if I were to 
dispatch the <persName>Surplus twenty</persName>, I entertain great fears that <persName>Many others </persName>would
leave and we Should immediately be left with a <persName>trifling force</persName>.</p>

<p>That you May be fully informed of the true State of the arsonal when
<placeName>this place</placeName> was Captured, that you May see My inability to furnish aid
therefrom, I inclose you a correct Statement made by our <persName>quarter Master
</persName>and <persName>Commissary</persName>, every Specis of arms which could be made usefull and
Efficient have been put in requisition, for the purpose of arming our [own]
<persName>Men </persName>and Some <persName>Mexicans </persName>of this place . . . [com]manded by <persName>Padilla</persName>
and <persName>Placidore the Alcalde of <placeName>Guadaloupe Victoria</placeName></persName> who have Volunteered
in our cause.</p>

<p>The <persName>Mexican Volunteers</persName> are not included [in] our Numbers to Make
the <persName>hundred and Twenty [men]</persName>, because we know Not as yet how far they
may be relied upon in as Much as Some of them are the <persName>prisoners </persName>who were
captured here, who have been released at the request and by the desire and
on the pledge of <persName>Padilla</persName>&#8212;It Seems to be the General opinion among the
<persName>intelegent Mexicans</persName> here that <persName>Coss </persName>will Make a desparate Effort to regain
this place. How far this is correct I am Not prepared to Say. They 
believe this because they Conceive it to be the Connecting link between
<placeName>Bexar </placeName>and <placeName>all the Coast</placeName>.</p>

<p>Supplies of provisions are Scarce but every exertion will be Made to
Secure a Sufficient quantity in order to enable us to Stand a Siege
Annexed to the Statement of arms etc you will find a Statement of Men
and arms at <placeName>Bexar </placeName>as taken from public documents, here and suppose by
other testimony which is Conceived to be entitled to Credit, you will 
discover from that Statement that the Number is Much greater than was 
anticipated by any of us though the last 500 Named are admitted to be 
Exteremly inefficient</p>

<p>In my communication of <date when="1835-10-12">yesterday </date>you were informed that <placeName>Guadaloupe</placeName>
and <placeName>this place</placeName> had voluntarily declared in favour of the Constitution of <date n="xx-xx-1824">24</date>
and against Centralism,</p>

<p>The walls of the <placeName>fortification </placeName>here is in a perfect recked State and 
requires considerable repairs to Make it in any way tenable but we Shall use
all posseble exertion to put it in a cituation for defence and Should they
Make an attact upon us we will defend it to the last Moment but I presume
they will attempt to Starve us out for with a <persName>large force</persName> they can cut off<pb n="181"/>
our Supplies of water and provisions and you of course will be apprised
of their Movements and will act accordingly</p>
