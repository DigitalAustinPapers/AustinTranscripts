<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Since my first acquaintance with you in this <placeName>city</placeName>, I have had
the desire to emigrate to your <placeName>colony</placeName>; but circumstances of a private
nature, and some pecuniary embarrassments, have hitherto precluded
it. Moreover, not having, had the pleasure of an interview, or
even of correspondence with you, I have been deterred by <hi rend="italic">what</hi>, I
have always denounced as falsehood and detraction. <persName>Capt. Zepeniah
Butler</persName>, with whom I went to the <placeName>river Brassos</placeName>, has expressed his
wish to become a <persName>citizen</persName>,   from the just motives, which have ever<pb n="1225"/> influenced me in regard to your character as a gentleman, and your
justice, as an <persName>officer of the government</persName>; and not only, that; (though
a primary consideration) but the excellent quality of the soil, on
which your <placeName>colony</placeName> is founded.</p>

<p>I perceive however, not withstanding your justice, and judgement
in managing the local affairs of your <placeName>colony</placeName>, some difficulties will
arise among the evil disposed, which being transported into other
<placeName>communities abroad</placeName>, tend, (though but partially) I hope, (to injure your rising prosperity), and that of your great, and arduous
undertaking.</p>

<p>I mean, if possible, to visit <date n="Summer - 1826">next summer </date>the <placeName>settlement</placeName>, which
you have spent so much time, and money to establish, and flatter
myself, that, I shall find, that it even exceeds in every thing my
most sanguine expectations: but before that time, I sincerely solicit
you to write me, and transmit whatever inteligence you may deem
proper to communicate, or entrust to one, of whom you have had
so short an acquaintance.</p>

<p>I forbear to write any thing relative to the abusive and vindictive
publications of a certain individual, as the papers containing them
will be handed to you by <persName>Capt. J. T. Field</persName>, who is the <persName>bearer </persName>of this:
they are relative to the abuse of the <hi rend="italic">Buen gobierno del establecimiento</hi>.</p>

<p><persName>James Norton</persName>.</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Colo Stephen F. Austin</persName> <placeName>San Philipe De Austin
Texas U. M. S.</placeName></p>
