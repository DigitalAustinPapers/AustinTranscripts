<p><placeName><persName>KeyKendale</persName>s</placeName>, <date when="1823-08-29">Augt 29 1823</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>

<p>I expected to have visited you before this time but cannot do so
for two or three weeks&#8212;I am now endeavoring to find a place 
suitable for the <placeName>capital of the colony</placeName> and believe I shall fix it <placeName>below
<persName>Cummings</persName> on this River</placeName> at a place now occupied by <persName>Mr Bright</persName>&#8212;If
an opportunity opens I wish you would write me wheither there is
any suitable place on your <placeName>River </placeName>any where between the place<pb n="690"/>
called the <placeName>fort </placeName>and <placeName><persName>Mr. Boatright</persName>s</placeName> I do not wish to go higher up
than <placeName>Boatrights </placeName>unless the situation should by its superior natural
advantages require it. I want a place for the town on the <placeName>west side
of the Brazos</placeName> where there is abundance of good water besides the
river, either springs or a good creek.</p>

<p>The place I have in view on this river is very well watered with
the best of springs&#8212;it is about <placeName>38 miles from Castlemans</placeName>, about <placeName>65
or 70 miles from the mouth of this river</placeName>, about <placeName>25 miles from 
<persName>Boatright</persName>s</placeName> and I suppose about 45 miles from you, and about <placeName>70 miles
from the mouth of the Brazos</placeName> and if the <placeName>La Baca</placeName> is settled will
be nearly central, but if a situation can be found on the <placeName>Brazos </placeName>more
so and a good site I will fix it there&#8212;</p>

<p>I wish you could do me the favor to select some good places for
me say about six or eight league tracts any where between <placeName><persName>Parker</persName>s
</placeName>and <placeName><persName>McFarland</persName>s</placeName>, or employ some one to do it and I will pay for
it&#8212;or I will pay you if your other occupations will permit. I want
good land water and timber, and if the places are not selected now
they will all be occupied. It will be a real service to me if you can
do this, and Mark them and let it be known that they are reserved&#8212;
also try and find the best place for a town up above or near you on
the <placeName>River</placeName>&#8212;it will be valuable at some future day, and you shall be
profited by making a good selection in <placeName>lots</placeName>&#8212;also I want a good
situation on some creek off from the River where there is a body of
good land suitable for a <placeName>stock farm</placeName>&#8212;also some good <placeName>mill seats</placeName> if to
be had&#8212;it is no more than just that I should have a pick as well
as others, and I have too much public business to attend to, to do
anything for myself and must call on my <persName>friends </persName>to aid me&#8212;I will
send you a regulation relative to <persName>Indians</persName>, <persName>vagabonds </persName>etc. as soon
as it is copied which I wish to have rigidly enforced&#8212;</p>

<p>How do I envy the quiet life you enjoy&#8212;I have not a moment
that I can call my own, and the task before me is a very troublesome
one I cannot expect to please all nor shall I try to do it&#8212;I will try
to satisfy myself by doing justice to all-</p>

<p>It is probably I shall go to <placeName><persName>McFarland</persName>s</placeName> in three or four days, to
look at that place for a town, but I am told that there is no good
water there.</p>

<p>Remember me to <persName>Mrs. Bell</persName>, your friend</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>I shall decide on the town in less than a week therefore if you
know of any good place send me word soon.</p>

<p><persName>J. H. Bell</persName></p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr. Josiah H. Bell</persName> <placeName>Brazos </placeName>Care of <persName>Kykendall</persName></p>
