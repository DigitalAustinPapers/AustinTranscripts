<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin </placeName><date when="1833-04-02">April 2d, 1833</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. N. Cox</persName></p>

<p>Dr Sir. I reed, your esteemed favor of <date when="1833-03-01">1 ult.</date> recommending <persName>Doctor
Spaulding</persName>   It will give me great pleasure to do any thing in my<pb n="941"/>
power to promote the views of the <persName>Docter</persName>.   He stoped at <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>
and I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing him.</p>

<p>It is highly gratifying to me that you and <persName>Mr. Sanders</persName> approve
of my conduct in relation to the settlement of the business of our
mutual friend <persName>J. H. Hawkins' estate</persName>.</p>

<p>After the many years of labor and hardships and perplexities I
have undergone in this <placeName>country </placeName>by which I have secured a handsome
fortune for the <persName>heirs</persName>, I was not prepared to receive censure from any
of them, because I thought that I did not merit it. <persName>Edmund</persName>, I fear,
received incorrect impressions from some persons who are unfriendly
to me, but I think they are removed now and that he is very well
satisfied.</p>

<p>It would be gratifying for me to receive assurances from <persName>Mr. Haws</persName>,
and from <persName>Geo. N. Hawkins</persName> that they were satisfied with the 
settlement and with my conduct I have always viewed <persName>J. H. Hawkins</persName>
more like a brother than any thing else. I am however well aware
that it is very difficult for persons at a distance, who live in a well
organised <placeName>community </placeName>to form a correct idea of the trouble, or labor,
or difficulties of doing business in this <placeName>country </placeName>of the kind I have been
engaged in.</p>

<p>Your approbation is very gratifying indeed for I prise your
opinions very highly.</p>

<p>I am endeavoring to close all my affairs and totally withdraw 
myself from public matters or <hi rend="italic">politics</hi>&#8212;it is not so easy to do, as at first
appeard.</p>

<p>Our convention has met and will no doubt apply to the<persName> national
congress </persName>for the admission of <placeName>Texas </placeName>into the <placeName>mexican union </placeName>as a <placeName>State</placeName>.
I think the application will be granted. I believe it is very necessary
to save this <placeName>country </placeName>from ruin. We are now able to sustain A <persName>State
Govt</persName>, and no <placeName>country </placeName>ever required one more than this.</p>
