<p><persName>Stephen F Austin</persName>, <persName>Jared E. Groce</persName> <persName>James Cummings</persName> and <persName>Jno
P Coles</persName> a <persName>Committe </persName>Unanimously appointed at a general meeting
held on the <date when="1824-06-05">5th June instant</date> by the <persName>Inhabitants of the <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName> formed
in the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName> by the <persName>empresario S F Austin</persName> in the name
and in the behalf of said <persName>Inhabitants </persName>respectfully represent to your
sovereignty that these <persName>Colonists </persName>emigrated to this establishment
from <placeName>Louisiana </placeName>in Consequence of the Invitation of said <persName>Austin</persName>
and many of them brought their <persName>negro slaves</persName> with them as also all
their property intending to establish themselves permanantly in this
<placeName>Province</placeName>. They have been much alarmed by the news Communicated
through the <placeName>public Gazette</placeName> that your Sovereignty were about to
pass a Law freeing all the <persName>Slaves </persName>that were introduced by the
<persName>emigrants</persName>.</p>

<p>These <persName>Inhabitants </persName>respectfully represent to your sovereignty that
the <persName>Slaves </persName>introduced into this establishment by the <persName>emigrants </persName>were
not brought here for the purpose of Trade or speculation neither
are they <persName>Africans </persName>but are the <persName>family servants</persName> of the <persName>emigrants </persName>and
raised by them as such from their infancy and were intended to aid
in clearing the Land and establishing their <placeName>farms </placeName>which these
<persName>Colonists </persName>Could not have effected without them for this <placeName>Province </placeName>is
entirely uninhabited and great Labor required in Opening <placeName>farms</placeName>
and as the Law sanctioned the introduction of <persName>slaves </persName>into the
Country the <persName>emigrants </persName>felt entirely safe in bringing them.</p>

<p>These <persName>Inhabitants </persName>therefore respectfully solicit that your 
sovereignty will take into Consideration the right of property they have
to their <persName>slaves </persName>that they brought them here As a necessary part of
the Capital required by the desert State of the Country to establish
their <placeName>farms </placeName>and <placeName>Ranches </placeName>and if freed the loss of their value added<pb n="828"/>
to the very heavy expenees of removing such a distance and settling
in An entire <placeName>wilderness </placeName>and suffering all (he miseries of Hunger, 
exposed to the attack of Hostile <persName>Indians </persName>will complete their total
ruin&#8212; Also these <persName>Inhabitants </persName>respectfully represent that some of
their <persName>friends </persName>and Relations visited this Country <date n="Spring-1824">last spring</date> and
<date n="Winter-1823">winter </date>and selected their Lands as a part of the Above named 300
<persName>families</persName> After building <placeName>Cabins </placeName>they returned to move out their
<persName>families </persName>this <date n="Summer-1824">summer </date>and <date n="Fall-1824">fall </date>and are now on the Road bringing
their <persName>Slaves </persName>with them relying on the faith of the Colonization Law
under which <placeName><persName>Austin</persName>'s establishment</placeName> is formed&#8212; Article [30] of
which Law Authorises the introduction of <persName>Slaves </persName>by the <persName>Colonists</persName>
those <persName>emigrants </persName>therefore who are on the Road and are detained
by the excessive heat and destructive drouth that now prevodes this
whole <placeName>Country </placeName>will be totally and forever ruined if on their arrival
here after so much fatigue labor and expense in removing they are
to loose their <persName>Slaves </persName>and besides that be liable to heavy punishment
for bringing them&#8212;</p>

<p>These <persName>Inhabitants </persName>therefore respectfully pray that your 
sovereignty may take their Case into Consideration and declare that the
<persName>slaves </persName>and their <persName>descendents </persName>of the <persName>300 families</persName> who emigrate to
the <placeName>Establishment </placeName>formed by the <persName>Emprasario Stephen F Austin</persName> in
this province shall be <persName>slaves </persName>for Life and that the emancipation Law
which we have been informed has lately passed shall not apply to
the <persName>slaves </persName>of the said <persName>300 families</persName> except so far as prohibits all trade
or trafic of them and should this solicitation be incompatible with
the intentions of your sovereignty these <persName>Inhabitants </persName>pray that the
necessary time may be allowed them to remove their <persName>slaves </persName>back to
the <placeName>United States</placeName></p>
