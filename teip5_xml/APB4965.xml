<p>9 oclock A, M <date when="1835-10-19">Oct 19&#8212;/35</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. President</persName></p>

<p>Sir&#8212;After having heard you <date when="1835-10-19">this morning</date> in regard to the arrest of
<persName>Judge Williams</persName>, I communicated your Idias and mine to <persName>Mr Hardin</persName> on
that subject, it met his full approbation, <persName>Mr. Hardin</persName> further observed
to me that he thought it was advisable and necessary to have a <persName>Mr J M
Smith</persName> also arrested, His reasons were as follows&#8212;<persName>Mr Smith</persName> has always
been opposed to the Cause of Freedom, he has when ever in his power,
favored the <persName>Mexicans</persName>, to the prejudice of <persName>Our Citizens</persName> the has Sir, injured
the Cause of Liberty by Giving all the information possible to <persName>enemies</persName>,
(that is to those that are now our <persName>enemies</persName>) He has Sir, when the <persName>Pirate
Thompson</persName> was lying in the <placeName>bay of Galveston</placeName>) informed him of all He
knew of the movements and intention of our <persName>Citizens</persName>, he has Sir, 
blacken'd the reputation of the <persName>best Citizens in <placeName>that part of the Contry</placeName></persName>, by 
informing the<persName> Mexican officers</persName>. <persName>Military </persName>as well as those that belong'd to the
<placeName>Custom House</placeName> of all that was said by them and a great deal more, All
lies of his he has to my knowledge Sir, attempted to take the life of <persName>Mr
Chs Wilcox</persName>, for no other reason but only because, he was favorable to our
cause, and took an active part in the affair that took place at <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>,
and was the advocate of Freedom<pb n="194"/></p>

<p>He has influence enough Sir, to injure our cause matirealy. He is 
beside all I have stated to you of his character, a <persName>murderer </persName>My reason for
saying so, is that a few days before I left home I was informed that, <persName>he
and his son</persName>, have murdered a <persName>Mr Carroll, (son in law to said Smith)</persName> the
last accusation is not probably the business of this body&#8212;but it is my
opinion that as we had had no <placeName>court </placeName>in the <placeName><hi rend="italic">districk </hi>of Liberty</placeName> since our
<placeName>country </placeName>has been attack'd Therefore I think it is our duty to have him
arrested, not only as a <persName>murderer</persName>, but as a <persName>Traitor </persName>and an <persName>enemy </persName>to the
Cause of Liberty</p>

<p><persName>Peter J. Menard</persName>, approved of by <persName>Joseph Bryan</persName>&#8212;Both
from <placeName>Liberty</placeName></p>

<p>[Addressed]: To The <persName>President of the Genl Council of Texas</persName></p>
