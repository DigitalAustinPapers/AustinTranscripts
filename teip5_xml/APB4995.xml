<p><placeName>2 miles from Bexar</placeName> <date when="1835-10-28">Oct 28th</date></p>

<p>We arrived here about the middle of the day. A party of <persName>90 men</persName> under
<persName>Bowie </persName>and <persName>Capt Fannin</persName> who were sent here <date when="1835-10-27">yesterday </date>to pick out a position
for the <persName>army </persName>were attacked by <persName>300 cavalry </persName>and <persName>100 infantry </persName>with two pieces
of artillery the attack was made about day brake, <persName>16 mexicans </persName>were left
dead on the ground and several <persName>wounded </persName>and <persName>dead </persName>were taken off by the
<persName>cavalry</persName>. <persName>Capt. Richard Andrews</persName> from the <placeName>Colorado </placeName>was shot in the 
stomach It is supposed he will die one or two more were slightly wounded is
all the injury we sustained. The <persName>main army</persName> did not arrive from the 
<placeName>mission de Espada</placeName> where it was stationed untill about one hour after the battle.
The contest lasted 4 hours, We took an excellent brass piece, a long 6
pounder which will be of service to us, they succeeded in getting away with
the other pieces, We have upwards of 400 <persName>men </persName>and provision tolerable
plenty 4 waggons have arrived with Supplies, We are now near the <placeName>Mission
Concepcion on the San Antonio River</placeName>. We occupy the <placeName>banks of the river</placeName>,
plenty of bushes and trees which saved the lives of many of our <persName>soldiers</persName><pb n="218"/>
<persName>100 men </persName>will be here <date when="1835-10-29">to morrow</date> from <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>and 3 or 4 peices of
artillery shortly <placeName>Bexar </placeName>I think will fall shortly. An <persName>express </persName>was arrested
<date when="1835-10-27">yesterday </date>with letters from <placeName>Matamoros </placeName>and other places by which we 
received letters directed to <persName>Cos </persName>etc stating that money and <persName>troops </persName>were scearce
articles. The Montazuma now Bravo is ordered to the <placeName>Arransas </placeName>to cruiz but
without <persName>troops</persName>, There are 6 cannon mounted in <placeName>Bexar </placeName>to recieve us, and
about <persName>650 men</persName>. I think after hearing all the stories about the <persName>dead </persName>and
<persName>wounded </persName>the <persName>enemy </persName>lost 50 <persName>men </persName>as to the dead I saw 15 or 16 myself on
the ground and two <persName>prisoners </persName>badly wounded now in our <placeName>camp</placeName>, We have
<persName>four prisoners</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Joel </persName>is well so are the two <persName>McNeels</persName> and <persName>Hassell </persName>neither of them had a
chance to distinguish themselves. <persName>Uncle </persName>is much better in fact he is well
I hope the campaign will soon be over. I have written 2 or 3 times since
I left <placeName>San felipe</placeName></p>

<p>The <persName>express </persName>is about starting <persName>Joel</persName>'s and my love to all</p>

<p><persName>M. Austin Bryan</persName> [Rubric]</p>
