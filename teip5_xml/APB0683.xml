<p><placeName>Natchez</placeName>&#8212;<date when="1824-02-01">February 1&#8212;1824</date></p>
<p><persName>Col. Steven Austin</persName>, Dr. sir&#8212;since my return to the <placeName>U. States</placeName> from
the <placeName>Province of Texas</placeName>&#8212;I have been kept busy in endeavoring to
counteract the unfavorable impressions made here as to the soil
and climate of <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;and the character and prospects of your 
<placeName>settlement </placeName>there.&#8212;Some disappointed <persName>travellers </persName>joined with the <persName>large
land holders</persName> here have used every means in their power to check
embarrass and discourage emigration&#8212;The character of the 
country&#8212;is however rising here&#8212;and the tide of emigration is taking
a favorable turn.&#8212;I am very glad to learn that you have taken a
position on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>&#8212;at the <placeName>Atascosito crossing</placeName>&#8212;In a 
geographical view this is a central point&#8212;and must be the centre of 
population&#8212;It is safe from invasion by sea&#8212;It is also remote from the
range of all the large tribes of <persName>Indians</persName>&#8212;and it is the very place
where a dense <placeName>settlement </placeName>should be formed&#8212;to be extended above
and below within supporting distance of one another&#8212;as <persName>settlers</persName>
come in&#8212;as you know it is about <placeName>100 miles from La Bahia</placeName>&#8212;and
moreover it is not more than <placeName>sixty miles from a navigable point on
the <hi rend="italic">Santo Hacinto</hi></placeName>&#8212;which emptying into the <placeName>Bay of Galveston</placeName>
forms the best <placeName>harbor </placeName>on the <placeName>coast</placeName>&#8212;Besides the navigation&#8212;of
the <placeName>Brassos </placeName>is at all times practicable&#8212;with small Boats and 
although I found 10 feet water over the Bar at the mouth&#8212;the
entrance is deemed unsafe particularly in a rough sea&#8212;Yet is but
<placeName>16 miles from the mouth of the Brazos</placeName>&#8212;to the <placeName>west end of 
Galvezton</placeName>&#8212;where vessels have a safe anchorage with 30 feet water&#8212;
since my return I have sent out two boats of 30 ton each loaded
with flour and fat meat with some whiskey sugar and coffee 
consigned to <persName>Capt. John McFarlane</persName>&#8212;by bad management of the <persName>Pilot</persName>
as I am inclined to think they were both lost&#8212;I intend however<pb n="738"/>
seeing you in person this <date n="Spring-1824">spring </date>or next <date n="Fall-1824">fall</date>&#8212;I have made 
arrangements with the <persName>Coshatees </persName><persName>Alabamas </persName>and all the <persName>Indians on this
side the <placeName>Brassos</placeName></persName> for their cooperation in any expedition I choose to
undertake they are well armed&#8212;and ask nothing but to be 
furnished with powder and lead&#8212;which I can easily send to them from
<placeName>Alexandria </placeName>I shall not bring less than 150 <persName>Americans </persName>well armed&#8212;
with six months provisions&#8212;and if the safety and security of the
<placeName>settlement </placeName>requires it&#8212;I will sweep every <persName>Tawokkowni</persName>&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><persName>Tankowa</persName></hi>
and <persName>Karrankowa</persName>&#8212;<persName>Indian </persName>from the face of the earth&#8212;There is at
present a strong prospect of a war&#8212;in which <placeName>France </placeName>and <placeName>Spain </placeName>will
combine to subjugate <placeName>Mexico</placeName>&#8212;in which case <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> and the
<placeName>U. States</placeName> will unite in support of the independence of the <placeName>Mexican
Republic</placeName>&#8212;<placeName>Texas </placeName>however cannot be involved in the struggles&#8212;or
made the scene of military operations&#8212;</p>
