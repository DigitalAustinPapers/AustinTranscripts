<p><placeName>Hempstead County Ark. T&#8212;</placeName><date when="1825-05-24">24th May 1825</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Austin</persName></p>

<p>A gentleman has just called at our <placeName>court house</placeName> who says he is
going to your <placeName>settlement in Texas </placeName>, consequently I have but a moment
to write&#8212; I have at last got possession of your trunk and I 
suppose the most of your books but the trunk has been broke open and
I expect some articles taken out of it, the trunk was at<placeName><persName>Vaughn</persName>s</placeName>
and after his death a notorious scoundrel by the name of <persName>Fields</persName>
married the <persName>widow </persName>who denied haveing it but it was after discovered
by the <persName>Adms. of Vaughns estate</persName> and taken out of <persName>Field</persName>s possession. I
did not deem it proper to send them to <placeName>N Orleans</placeName> as you had some
four or five years ago instructed me to do but concluded to keep them
till I hear from you again on that subject&#8212; please write me the
first oportunity I will obey any orders that you may make relative
to your trunk send it <placeName>down the river</placeName> or keep possession of it till
called for&#8212; I am sorry I have not time to give you all the news
of the country, the local and domestic concerns of <placeName>Hempstead County</placeName>
as well as the politicks of the country&#8212; Give me a history of your
<placeName>country </placeName>what the prospect is for makeing money there, or what
would be profitable taken to or from your <placeName>country</placeName>&#8212; If you know
any thing of <persName>Doctor Andrews</persName> for Gods sake let me hear of him, I
feel interested in <persName>Andrews</persName> and would like to know that he is doing
well If he is with you tell him we have a flourishing little <placeName>village</placeName>
at the place he was endeavouring to get the <placeName>seat of justice</placeName> located
at for this county, <placeName>on the head of the Bodark</placeName>, called <placeName>Washington</placeName>.</p>

<p>This is now my <placeName>residence</placeName>&#8212; tell him his <persName>sweetharts</persName> are all married
etc&#8212;</p>

<p>Accept sir my well wishes for your prosperity and happiness</p>

<p><persName>John Clark</persName></p>
