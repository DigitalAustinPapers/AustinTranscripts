<p><date when="1825-09-22">Sept. 22nd 1825</date></p>
<p><persName>Mr. Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear sir My acquaintance with your general character, (though I
have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance, having seen you
only a few times while at <placeName><persName>William Stevenson</persName>s</placeName> in <placeName>mount prairies</placeName>) and
the high station you hold in the land in which you live induces me to
hope for success on the present occasion</p>

<p>A man by the name of <persName>Ruben McHaws</persName> has swindled me out of
about $250,00 by tradeing me sundry forged notes of his own 
manufactory on <persName>citizens </persName>that I knew to be good; the precise amount is
$242,25   two <persName>negro fellows</persName> one belonging to <persName>Mr John Johnson</persName> the <pb n="1207"/>other to <persName>Saml Hopson</persName> has recently run away&#8212;<persName>Hopsons Negro</persName> was
taken up makeing his way to your <placeName>province </placeName>and is of opinion the other
perished <placeName>in the woods</placeName> I have not heard that he has ever been found
and says that <persName>McHaws</persName> persuaded them to run away I made every
exersion to catch the <persName>vilian</persName>, but finally failed; and the only hope I
now have of detecting him, is in your concern for my interest from
the merits of the case: You need have no apprehension of the 
existance of my <placeName>claim </placeName>which is coroborated by the accompanied affidavit
<persName>McHaws</persName> is of Moderate size with blue eyes and balld headed, And
will perhaps pass through your dominions in the character of a
<persName>pedler</persName>: Now sir if it be consistent with your authority to destrain
his effects in order to secure me you will do me a favour never to be
forgotten and I would be glad if you would write me immediately on the subject I feel the more anxiety on the occasion as this is a large
amount for me, in my situation, to loose: And I do declare upon
honour that I am able to establish the above accounts to all intents
and purposes</p>

<p>We have nothing of import; you have heard no doubt that the 
<persName>Chactaws</persName> will shortly posses our <placeName>country </placeName>and many of the <persName>inhabitants</persName>
talk of moveing to your <placeName>province </placeName>I intend so soon as my business
will admit paying your <placeName>country </placeName>a visit and if I like to locate there.</p>

<p><persName>John H. Fowler</persName></p>

<p><persName>Stephen F Austin Gov. <placeName>Prov. Texes</placeName></persName></p>
