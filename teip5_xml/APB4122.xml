<p><placeName>Rio Grande</placeName> <date when="1831-01-03">3 Jany. 1831</date></p>
<p>Dr Sir.</p>

<p>I have just arrived at this place, and as the mail is on the point
of leaving I drop you a line. I am comfortably lodged with <persName>Dn Juan
Francisco Lombaña</persName> whom I think a very gentlemanly man.<pb n="572"/></p>

<p>I shall detain here one day for the <persName>escort </persName>to get ready. The [re]
appears to be nothing new that I have heard of&#8212;tho have made no
inquiries.   <persName>Padre Musquis</persName> has gone on.</p>

<p><persName>[George] Nixon</persName> has expressed so much anxiety to be on good terms
again that I have agreed to it and wrote you by him stating that he
could [have] a League where it was entirely unappropriated&#8212; the
best conquest that can be made over an enemy is to convert him into
a friend. I told him that he could not get any <placeName>forfeited League</placeName>.
On reflection as to the <placeName>Lindsey League</placeName>&#8212;I think it had better be
held, for the present. After my arrival at <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>I think I can
get your petition granted, and if so you are more entitled to that
<placeName>League </placeName>than any one else, and you shall have my support to get it&#8212;
but keep this to yourself. Send instructions to <persName>S. P. Brown</persName> how to
regulate his chain to the <placeName>Mexican </placeName>Measure. He sent me word by
<persName>Williamson </persName>that he had forgotten the difference between the <placeName>Mexican</placeName>
and <placeName>english </placeName>measure.</p>

<p>If <persName>young Tumlinson</persName> applies for a place up <placeName>on Navidad </placeName>let him
have one&#8212;he is the best of that <persName>family</persName></p>

<p>Remember me to <persName>Sarah </persName>and <persName>Mrs. Sweet</persName></p>

<p><persName>S. M. Williams  </persName> <persName>S. F. Austin </persName>[Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] Al <persName>Señor Dn Samuel Williams</persName>, en <placeName>San Felipe de
Austin</placeName></p>
