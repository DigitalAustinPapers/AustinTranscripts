<p>Dear sir   Presuming on the acquaintance I had with you while
a <persName>citizen </persName>of our <placeName>Territory</placeName>&#8212;I have taken the liberty of enclosing<pb n="1388"/>
a transcript of a Judgmt in my favour against <persName>Peter Tyler</persName> who
formerly lived on <placeName>white River</placeName> in this <placeName>Territory </placeName>and whom you may
have perhaps seen, while a resident here&#8212;he <persName>Tyler </persName>has been 
reported as dead and letters of administrad granted on his <persName>Estate</persName>&#8212;
but in consequence of the unsettled way in which he left his busness
nothing has been obtained by the <persName>administr </persName>to satisfy the debts he
was owing&#8212;many persons on <placeName>white River</placeName> where he formerly lived
believe he is still living, and residing in some part of your 
<placeName>settlement</placeName>&#8212;should this be the case he no doubt has property sufficient
to satisfy the balance due me of the judgement. If <persName>Tyler </persName>is still
living and in your <placeName>settlement </placeName>as reported&#8212; and you can do any
thmg to secure this debt, it will lay me under obligations to you,
which I shall always be happy to have it in my [power] to 
reciprocate. I dislike to trouble you with this business and should not have
done it&#8212;were it not for the assurance of our mutual friends <persName>Mesrs.
Scott and Crittenden</persName></p>

<p><persName>T. Farrelly</persName>,</p>
<p>NB   Will you have the goodness to drop me a line on this 
subject,   direct " <placeName>Post of Arkansas </placeName>"</p>

<p>Dr Sir:</p>

<p>The inteligence that you have rendered our mutual friend 
<persName>Terrence Farrelly</persName> assistance on the subject of the enclosed business will
be received with great satisfaction by us&#8212;we know the claim to be
a just one, and believe that <persName>Tyler </persName>has not acted as a good <persName>citizen</persName>
of your <placeName>colony </placeName>should act with regard to it,&#8212; Our respective 
<persName>families </persName>are all in health&#8212; we have seen a <persName>gentelman </persName>by the name of
<persName>Gross </persName>direct from your <placeName>settlement </placeName>a few days since who gives us
a most flattering account of your porsperity and popularity&#8212; May
both increase while life lasts is the prayer of your devoted friends</p>
