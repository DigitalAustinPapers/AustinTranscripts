<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>I recd your of the <date when="1825-01-06">6th</date> Instant and Enclosed I found <persName>Gaines</persName> letter
as Respects the Horse <persName>Mitchial</persName> let him [have] at my <placeName>House </placeName>in my
absence with a request that I should try and pay <persName>Gaines </persName>with the
Horse and if <persName>Gaines</persName> did not take the Horse to pay <persName>Gaines</persName> myself
and keep the Horse and If I did not want the Horse he would
pay me some other way and take Back the Horse However 
when <persName>Gaines</persName> Returned from <placeName>Saint Antonio</placeName> I told him of the Horse
he said he would take him But we could not find the Horse and
consequently believed he had been stolen by some <persName>Spaniards</persName> who had
passed when the Horse Ran <date when="1825-01-09">sunday </date>after I found the Horse and
had him valued Intending to dispose of him as he was 
Troublesome and constantly trying to Run of he was supposed by <persName>Byrd</persName>
<persName>Capt Jones</persName> and others to be worth five or six dollars in cash I
then saw <persName>Mitchal</persName> and Told him the Horse would not pay his debt
to <persName>Gains</persName> which was $12&#8212;   he observed he did not know how he<pb n="1015"/>
should pay it I then Told him I would take the Horse and pay
<persName>Gains</persName> for him which he Readily agreed to this was the first time
I have seen <persName>Mitchal</persName> from the time <persName>Gains</persName> left the account with me and
as to his having any claims to the Horse or ever seeing the Horse
or my ever Receiving the Horse for him or agreeing to send the
Horse or any thing Else to him is a palpable Lye for he has my
Receipt and I never should send him any thing Untill my Receipt
was presented he Requested me to Collect those debts and Receive
Land office money in payment the 12$ which I promised to pay
for<persName> Mitchal</persName> is Ready when my Receipt is presented as Respects
<persName>Hall</persName>s Business and <persName>Roberson</persName>'s and <persName>Gaynes</persName> you will find inclosed
the original account in favour of <persName>Gaynes</persName> for $14.25 protested by <persName>Roberson</persName> and an affidavit of <persName>J W Hall</persName> on the Back of said account proving
the sum of fourteen Dollars and 25 cts paid to<persName> Gaynes</persName> by him for
<persName>Roberson</persName> as also you will find <persName>Lewis Holloway</persName>s deposition in the
case the petition and affidavit of Hall and Executn and attachment you will discover from <persName>Hall</persName>s affidavit that he claimed fourteen Dollars and 25 cts in cash and had it not been for an arrangement which I made with <persName>Hall</persName> myself in Order to favor <persName>Gaynes</persName>
the sum which payed the debt would not have paid the One forth
part of it there is an account now in my office for $9&#8212;Dollars
which is Similar to the above It is claimed by <persName>Roberson</persName> and
proven by <persName>Holloway</persName> to have been passed by <persName>Roberson</persName> for <persName >Hall</persName>
to <persName>Gaines</persName> and afterwards paid by <persName>Hall</persName> <persName>Roberson</persName> has been petitioned for an attachment in that case against <persName>Gains</persName> but I have
still put him of upon the whole they are I fear a dambed sett of
<persName>Rascals </persName>and <persName>Gaynes</persName> the worst of all</p>

<p><persName>Jno P. Coles</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>S. F. Austin Political Chief, and Judge</persName> of the
