<p><placeName>Mouth of Brasos </placeName><date when="1826-06-18">18th June 1826</date>
</p>
<p>Dear Sir&#8212;I think it my duty to inform you of A circumstance
that took place here a few days since&#8212;<persName>Msrs- Wells</persName> and <persName>Duncan</persName> of
<placeName>New Orleans</placeName> and the schooner Apalacha packet was recked on the
coast <placeName>about fifty miles. S. W. of this.</placeName>   <persName>Mr. Wells</persName> was <persName>owner of the
vessel</persName> and him self and <persName>Duncan </persName>owners of the cargo <persName>Mr. Wells</persName>
having a <persName>family </persName>in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> was in haste to return, and told the
<persName>people </persName>of this place that they were welcom to the recked property
if they would go after it, and after that arangement his fellow
suferer <persName>Duncan </persName>concluded to stay and attend to the getting of the
property and <persName>Wells </persName>then authorised <persName>Duncan </persName>to do the best he could
with his property and account to him in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> for the
 proceads if there should be any after paying the charges of getting it
to <placeName>Market</placeName>, there was a vessel laying here called a chicken thief that
could carry thirty odd barrels   this vessel had four <persName>men </persName><placeName>on board</placeName>
<persName>strangers </persName>and considerable of <persName>rufeans </persName>in conduct and in 
appearance the[y] held there quarters at My Man<persName> Wiants</persName> and at <persName>Mr.
Bradley</persName>s   this Boat and <persName>crew </persName>has been laying here for two months
after the vessel was recked <persName>Duncan </persName>tried to get them to go after the
property but they could not be hired on no terms and when the
Robroy arive <persName>Mr Duncan</persName> applied to <persName>Fields </persName>and My self to assist him
to get his recked property, we readily agreed and as soon as the
<persName>chicken thief company</persName> found that out they started immediately and
refused to let the <persName>owner </persName>of the property go<placeName> on board</placeName> with them, and
when they returned with the property they refused to give the <persName>owner</persName>
any part thereof   they soon herd my opinion of such conduct and
they removed to <persName>Mr, Bradley</persName>s, this conduct raised the feelings of
several of the <persName>citizens </persName>who happened to be here and some of the
 <persName>pasengers </persName>of the Robroy and when those <persName>plunderers </persName>found the people
against them they agreed to leave the affair to <persName>Men </persName>those Men 
declared they should give up half the property, they accordingly gave
up half the property that <persName>Duncan </persName>proved to be his and refused to
give up any that belonged to <persName>Wells </persName>and did not, there was six <persName>Men</persName>
concerned in this plundering business and I am sorry to say that
two of them were <persName>settlers </persName>of this place Namely <persName>David Wiant</persName> and
<persName>James Krunk</persName> the <persName>owner and Capt of the boat</persName> Calls himself <persName>Arad.
Sheldon</persName> the names of the others <persName>Wm. Grooden&#8212;Ranolds</persName> and <persName>Capt.
Jonny</persName>   our two <persName>settlers </persName>appeared to be the head of the <persName>company</persName>,
I have since requested my Man <persName>Wiant </persName>to desist from such conduct
or he mus leave my premicies for I could not admit of having it
made a rendevouse for <persName>pirates   </persName>he took the hint and has moved
about <placeName>three miles up the river on the west side</placeName> and there is two of
the <persName>company </persName>yet with him for the truth of thes statements I refer<pb n="1362"/>
you to <persName>Msrs Johnston</persName> and <persName>Burney </persName>who ware strangers and 
disinterested <persName>spectators </persName>likewise <persName>Laue Ricd Kenny</persName>. <persName>James Frazer</persName> and others preasent.</p>

<p>Such conduct as this I fear will be very injurious to the carector
of this place and to the <placeName>colony </placeName>in general for it is by Agriculture we
live but it is by commerce we thrive and we ought to protect that
commerce&#8212;I conclude at preasant with my cincere prayers for
heaven to hasten the happy time when government will take into
consideration the situation of this place and send on men clothed
with the proper authority and Means of protecting the honest part
of society and expelling those abandoned <persName>wretches </persName>who would suck
the blood of their fellow creatures who they find in distress, insted
of helping them</p>

<p><persName>Col. Stephen F. Austin</persName></p>
