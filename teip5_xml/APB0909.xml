<p><persName>Col Stephen F Austin</persName></p>

<p>Dear Sir After a long loansome and tedious journey I arrived
at home on the <date when="1824-11-07">7th Inst</date>., and agreeable to a request you made I have
formed a little company to go on to your <placeName>settlement </placeName>with goods two
young <persName>Gentlemen </persName>of this place will go on with me with between 2
and three thousand dollars worth of goods our object will be to
trade them off for Mules and to make a[s] quick and good sale of
the goods as possible I shall bring my family on with me if 
convenient I would like if you would have a cabbin built for me in
Town we expect to be there sometime in <date n="02-xx-1825">Feby</date>, should we find the
trade profitable and can collect mules tolerably fast and should it
meet with your approbation it is likely that we will open a fiew
goods in your <placeName>Province </placeName>as one of the Young Men who will be a long
has a <persName>Brother </persName>here who is a <persName>Merchant </persName>that will furnish him with any
amount of goods that he can sell and we are all to have an eaqual
interest. I now think that it will be best for us to take a trip to
Some of the <placeName>Spanish Towns</placeName> in order to enable us to make a good
and speedy trip however we do intend to take and be governed by
your advice entirely I would be glad that you would be ready to
give as your advice so soon as we arrive I calculate that we will
have a long some usefull articles for the <persName>people of your <placeName>Colony</placeName></persName>.</p>
