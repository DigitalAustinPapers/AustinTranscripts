<p>Austin to Samuel M Williams</p>

<p>[From Williams Papers, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Tex.]</p>

<p><placeName>Bexar </placeName><date when="1832-12-06">6 December 1832</date></p>
<p>S.M.W.</p>

<p>Dr Sir,   I arrived here on the <date when="1832-12-03">3 inst</date>&#8212;<date when="1832-12-05">yesterday </date>there was a 
meeting of the <persName>principal citizens</persName>&#8212;that is the <persName>Chief&#8212;Erasmo [Seguin]</persName>&#8212;<pb n="898"/>
the <persName>Navarros</persName>&#8212;<persName>Col. Elosua</persName>&#8212;<persName>Balmaceda</persName>&#8212;<persName>Flores</persName>&#8212;<persName>Garza </persName>etc, and I
gave them an exact discription of the evils that are retarding the
progress of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Stated in plain terms the necessity of 
separating from <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>, and the desire of the <persName>people </persName>generally to do so&#8212;
and said everything I could to induce them to concur in taking that
step at once.</p>

<p>The matter was discussed and talked over with great calmness
and interest. There was not a dissenting voice as to the necessity of
a remidy and all agreed that a separation from <placeName>Coahuila </placeName>was the
best, but they thought it precipitate to take that step before any
representations of our grievances were made to the <persName>Govt</persName>. This they
considered a necessary preliminary step. Finding that they would
not agree to go into the meas[ure] [before] the intermediate step of
representing had been resorted to, I urged the absolute importance
of proceeding immediately to take that step, by the <persName>Ayuntamto </persName>of
this place&#8212;that <hi rend="italic">All </hi>the grievances should be plainly and firmly
stated, and that the remonstrance should terminate with a positive
declaration that if our grievances were not fully redressed by the
<date when="1833-03-01">first day of March next</date>, <placeName>Texas </placeName>would then proceed immediately to
organize a <persName>local Government</persName>&#8212;they agreed to this, but thought <date n="03-xx-1833">March</date>
too short a time and <date n="04-xx-1833">April </date>was proposed and I think will be agreed to.</p>

<p>The conference was unofficial, of course,&#8212;it lasted from nine A. M.
to 2 P. M.&#8212;they were unanimous, and I have full confidence that
what was agreed on will be carried into effect.</p>

<p>The <persName>Ayuntamto </persName>is now in session on this matter to appoint a
<persName>committee </persName>to draw up the remonstrance, and I am of opinion that
the [most impatient man?] in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, will have no reason [to say
that] it is <hi rend="italic">too mild</hi>. They called on [me to] furnish the heads&#8212;
besides those [acted] on by the convention, I have given [some?]
others, including the whole system of the <persName>local administration</persName>&#8212;of
colonization&#8212;of the <persName>militia</persName>&#8212;all the violations of the constitution&#8212;
the insults offered to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, by the outrage on her <persName>representatives </persName>in
<date n="09-xx-1830">Sept. 1830</date>&#8212;the law No. 50&#8212;the retail law, the insult offered to the
<persName>Lieut. Govr </persName>by calling a <persName>judge </persName>to exercise the government etc, etc,
usurpations&#8212;the neglect of the <persName>Govt</persName>, towards the <persName>people to the <placeName>east
of my colony</placeName> and in <placeName>La Bahia</placeName> etc</persName>.</p>

<p>The object is to form a list of all the insults offered to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and
all her grievances and to <hi rend="italic">demand</hi>, full satisfaction. If it is not
granted, <placeName>Texas </placeName>can <hi rend="italic">then </hi>say to <placeName>Coahuila </placeName>and to the <placeName>world</placeName>&#8212;we were
insulted and oppressed&#8212;we asked redress&#8212;it was refused, and we
have redressed * * * [If I succeed] in getting this <persName>Ayto </persName>to
[pass] this remonstrance, as I have pro[posed] and as was agreed
to in the conference <date when="1832-12-05">[yester]day,</date> it will place <placeName>Texas </placeName>on much better
ground than to go into the measure now, and it will unite <placeName>this place<pb n="899"/>
and La Bahia</placeName> firmly with the balance of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, for they will be
so compromised that there will be no backing out, even if they wished
to do so; which they will not, for they are as anxious for a 
separation as we are, but wish to show to the world that they are right,
and stand on just ground in case force must ultimately be resorted to.</p>

<p>I will return as soon as this matter is concluded.</p>

<p><persName>Ramon Musquis</persName>, after all, is one of the <persName>best friends to <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>and
the truest that lives in this place and he deserves the confidence of
the <placeName>Colony </placeName>and of <placeName>all Texas.</placeName></p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin  </persName>  [Rubric]</p>

<p><persName>Arciniegas family </persName>are [well] Some one stole five dollars of the
money   *   *   *.   I paid it to make it $40.</p>

<p><persName>Committee: Angel Navarro, Cosiano of the Ayto., Erasmo,
Balmaceda, and Antonio Navarro.</persName></p>
