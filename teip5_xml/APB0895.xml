<p>[About November 1, 1824.]</p>

<p>Translation of the answers given by <persName>Col. Austin</persName> to the official
letter from the <persName>Priests and authorities of <placeName>La Bahia</placeName></persName></p>

<p>Reverend and respected Gentleman, I received your official letter
dated the <date when="1824-10-28">28 of October</date> in which you give us the pleasing intelligence
that the <persName>Carankaway Indians</persName> had agreed to and signed the treaty
of peace we made with a part of their chiefs, you also request in
behalf of the <persName>Indians </persName>that the division line between us could be 
extended to <placeName>La Baca</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Our desire being to guarantee a secure and permanent peace with
the <persName>Indians</persName>, the only reason we had for wishing limits fixed for<pb n="931"/>
them was to avoid even the possibility of future difficulty and to 
insure this it appeared to us necessary to separate the two parties by
a line in order to prevent neeting with them untill mutual 
confidence could be reestablished&#8212; It is not our wish to deprive the
<persName>Indians </persName>of their hunting or fishing grounds and governed by these
pacific feelings these <persName>inhabitants </persName>have agreed without difficulty to
the modification proposed that they are not to come on this side
of that River for the time specified in the treaty which was one
year from its date, and I sincerely hope with all my heart that
before that period confidence will be mutually established between
us and the <persName>Indians </persName>so that we may mix with each other without
suspicion on either part&#8212;</p>

<p>I present to you in behalf of these <persName>inhabitants </persName>their most sincere
thanks for the interest you have taken in this business and permit
me to add on my own part the expression of my gratitude and I
hope that you will continue to pretect the interests of this infant
<placeName>Colony </placeName>with your friendship and influence</p>

<p>God and Liby etc</p>
