<p><placeName>San Felipe</placeName> <date when="1835-11-01">Nov 1st 1835</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>General</persName>,</p>

<p>Your note to <persName>Mr. Jack</persName> and myself, I received <date when="1835-10-31">late last night</date>&#8212;</p>

<p>I regret to hear of your ill health, and wish it was in my power to send
you some suitable nourishment for the body, as well as for the mind 
however, I think we have nothing to complain of with respect to the latter.</p>

<p>I will use my utmost in raising and forwarding <hi rend="italic">"the one thing needful"</hi>
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> think too that the <persName>consultation </persName>ought to make provisions in the case, and
hope and trust they will I am just now going down to see what can be
done. You will see by the <placeName>paper </placeName>that the <persName>council </persName>has appointed me 
<persName>collector</persName>, and in all probability money will be paid on <placeName>land</placeName>, being much due.
I send you $70. which is all I have collected on your account since you left
except $5 which I sent by a <persName>gentleman </persName>which took charge of the pack horse
sent with your tent. etc.&#8212; I would send you some on my own account but
for the <placeName>printing establishment</placeName> which at this time is a heavy burden upon
us Have not received 75 dollars yet on our subscription: and our expenses
for <persName>workmen</persName>, making improvements etc has been 250 dollars per month.</p>

<p>So long as the war lasts it will be a dead and heavy weight upon us&#8212;
<persName>Thomas </persName>writes pressingly for me to come to <placeName>camp</placeName>&#8212; If I should go, the
business could not go on.</p>

<p>Dear friend I hope the intelligence from the <placeName>United States</placeName> will so 
encourage the <persName>men </persName>under your command, that they will not think of 
abandoning their <placeName>post</placeName>. <persName>Tom </persName>writes me that you intend to hold on so long as
you have 10 men and that you will waste your health by inches before you
will retreat.</p>

<p>May the God of Hosts protect and preserve you many years</p>

<p><persName>G. Borden Jr</persName> [Rubric]</p>

<p>I Inclose (50) fifty dollars and send you twenty by the hands of <persName>Mr.
McFadden</persName> who will hand you this&#8212;The money being the same that I 
collected for you.&#8212;	<persName>G. B</persName>.</p>
