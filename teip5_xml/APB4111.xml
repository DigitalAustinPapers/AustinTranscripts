<p>[Addressed:]<persName> D Esteban Austin</persName>   <placeName>S Anto de Bejar</placeName></p>


<p><placeName>New York</placeName><date when="1830-12-18"> December 18. 1830</date></p>
<p>My dear <persName>Cousin</persName>,</p>

<p>I wrote you <date when="1830-12-17">yesterday </date>by <persName>Mr. Treat</persName>, who was to leave <date when="1830-12-18">this morning</date>
Via <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, and now add a few lines by <persName>Mr Sayre</persName> a 
respectable <persName>Merchant of this City</persName>, to whom have taken the liberty of giving
a letter of introduction who is also to leave this morning Should the
weather permit, to join his Schooner Nelson at <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, which
Vessel sailed from here about <date when="1830-11-01">Six weeks Since</date> for <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, and 
intended as a regular <persName>trader </persName>between there and the above <placeName>port</placeName>.<persName> Mr.
Sayre</persName> tells me he takes with him property to the amount of ten
thousand dollars, and that he is at a loss whether to take an interest
of <placeName>10 to 20,000 Acres</placeName> of the <persName>Trustees </persName>of the <placeName>Grants of <persName>Zavala</persName>, <persName>Vehlein</persName>
and <persName>Burnet</persName></placeName> or wait until his arrival out and has an opportunity of
seeing you, and very desirous to know if you would dispose of any
of your lands and if so on what terms. Which information I regret
not being able to give him. I however rather advised his seeing you
before purchasing. There is so much interest excited of late in
favour of the <placeName>lands of Texas,</placeName> with the View of Speculation that it
is possible I might further your interest, were I aware of your plans
or dispositions as regards your <placeName>Colony</placeName>, and should you think proper
to give me that information or authority to act, you may rest assured
it will give me pleasure to forward your Views as far as may be in
my power. Or were I only to be made acquainted with your ideas
on the Subject it would enable me to give Satisfactory answers to
the many who call on me for information as regards your <placeName>Colony</placeName>.
<persName>Mr. Treat</persName> is the bearer of a friendly letter from the <persName>Trustees </persName>
appointed by the <persName>proprietors </persName>of the <placeName>Grants of <persName>Zavala</persName>, <persName>Vehlein </persName>and
<persName>Burnet</persName></placeName>, (as named in my letter by him) which was wrote at the
Suggestion of a particular <persName>friend </persName>of mine who has great influence<pb n="562"/>
with them, having previously agreed with me that it would be to
your interest as well as that of the <persName>Company </persName>that you should be
immediately made acquainted with their plan of operations as it
would prevent any unfriendly feeling that might arise from the
reports that may be in Circulation and at alevents [all events] the
information Could but prove acceptable to you, and which I was
pleased to find was approved of by the <persName>Trustees </persName>the moment it was
named to them, I am told the first <persName>Company </persName>obtains the land at
from 1 to 2 cents an Acre and that they have sold at 1Oc which price
<persName>Mr, Sayre</persName> would have to pay, and soon are to fix the price at 20$
the Acre. I have no doubt <persName>Mr. Sayre</persName> as well as <persName>Mr. Treat</persName> can give
you much interesting information as to the plans of the above land
Company which is represented to be the most extensive in the <placeName>world</placeName>,
and would refer you to them for further particulars.</p>

<p>I hope yet to get your Coat in time to send either by <persName>Mr. Treat</persName>
or <persName>Mr. Sayre</persName>. <persName>Col. Mexia</persName> who politely loaned his Coat to the
<persName>Taylor </persName>as a pattern that there should be no mistake as to the 
Uniform, is so much pleased with the Making of yours as to order one
made for himself. We have not a line from<persName> brother Henry</persName> since
his arrival with you and Very anxious to know how he is likely
to succeed there with his boat. In hopes of soon being favored
with aline from him as well as from your good self</p>

<p><persName>J. P. Austin</persName></p>
<p>P. S.</p>

<p><date when="1830-12-20">December 20th</date>&#8212;<persName>Mr. Treat</persName> as well as <persName>Mr. Sayre</persName> are detained by
the weather but expect to get away this morning which gives me
an opportunity to send your Coat by either, and as<persName> Mr. S.</persName> goes
first to <placeName>Bahia </placeName>I give it in Charge of <persName>Mr. Treat</persName> who will forward it
immediately should he not go direct himself as he probably will
do&#8212; It is a splendid Coat and I can but think you will be pleased
with it. the Cost of Making far exceeds the sum named to <persName>Mr.
Perry</persName> so much so that the <persName>Tailor </persName>charges no more than what he
actually pays his <persName>journeyman</persName>, the principal Cost is in the 
embroidery, which Cost $41&#8212;-The Cloth was secured from <persName>Mr. Perrys
friends</persName> in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#8212;with whom <persName>Mr. P</persName>. wrote he had left $20&#8212;
to pay for Making. The Money has not yet Come to hand but
presume will </p>
