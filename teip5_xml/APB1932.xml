<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date n="05-xx-1830">May 1830</date></p>
<p>Recd, the law of <date n="04/06/1830">6 April</date> the 11 Article of which suspends 
contracts for colonization in which<persName> North Americans</persName> were to be 
introduced and prohibited the emigration of <persName>North Americans</persName> to this
<placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>Considering this unjust interference with the rights vested in me
by my contracts on colonization. I wrote to the <persName>President 
Bustamante</persName> and to <persName>Genl Teran</persName> on the<date n="05/18/1830"> 18 May </date>(See copies of said two
letters)&#8212;in <date n="06-xx-1830">June </date>I recd <persName>Genl Teran</persName>s explanation of the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6
April</date> by which I was informed that it did not in any manner 
interfere with my <placeName>colony</placeName>&#8212;in consequence of this explanation I wrote
to <persName>Genl Teran</persName> and to the <persName>Vice President</persName> explaining away the harsh
parts of my letter of <date n="05/18/1830">18 May</date>.<pb n="386"/></p>

<p>During the months of <date n="05-xx-1830">May</date>, <date n="06-xx-1830">June </date>and <date n="07-xx-1830">July </date>considerable and 
alarming excitement prevailed amongst the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> and on the
<placeName>Nacogdoches frontier</placeName> it was so violent as [to] be on the eve of
breaking out.             </p>

<p><persName>Padilla</persName>s confinement put a stop to the land business and this was
thought to be a part of the plan to break up the new <persName>settlers </persName>in
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, resolutions of an inflamatory nature were entered into on
the <placeName>Ayish Bayou </placeName>etc. <persName>J. J. C.</persName> (?) came to see me&#8212; I advised peace
and quietness he coinsided with me&#8212; I was of opinion that a
popular commotion amongst the people would totally ruin the whole
<placeName>country </placeName>and destroy those who had anything to loose and as it was my
duty to try [to] avert so great an evil from my <placeName>colony</placeName>, I resorted to
such measures as I could to offset the object and accordingly caused
<persName>Bustamante</persName>s letter to me of <date n="03/20/1830">20 March</date> to be published in the <placeName>Texas
Gazette</placeName> also <persName>Teran</persName>'s official letter, and on the <date when="1830-07-10">10 July</date> some general
remarks which were intended to allay public excitement by giving
an explanation of the causes which had produced the law of <date when="1830-04-06">6 April
</date>and to shew that those causes were fast disappearing&#8212;- I never
believed that this <persName>Govt</persName>, intended to oppress us or treat us unjustly
in any manner for we had never [given] them any cause to do so and
if such was the intention it would be placing us on higher ground to
do our duty faithfully as<persName> Mexican citizens</persName>.</p>

<p>[Indorsed:] <date n="05-xx-1830">May 1830</date> [but evidently written later than July]
Memorandum<persName> S. F. Austin</persName></p>
