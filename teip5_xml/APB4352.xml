<p>[New Orleans], <date when="1832-06-08">June 8, 1832</date></p>
<p>Dear <persName>Cousin</persName>,</p>

<p>I can not go hence without writing to you, if but a line, at once
of adieu and welcome. I shall soon be on my way to <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>,
while you I hope are not far from your cherished <placeName>home</placeName>. I rejoice
to hear, as by last accounts, that your health and prosperity are so
flattering and pray God that you may be blessed in all things.</p>

<p>Our book is not out yet that I know of The late political 
disturbances in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>caused such a panic in <placeName>New York</placeName>, that 
everything was at a stand. I hope it will be no disadvantage in the end,
as they say it will not.   In the mean time all <placeName>Europe </placeName>is in commo-<pb n="779"/>
tion with wars and rumors of wars cholera etc. Despotism is 
seeking its last vengeance in <placeName>Spain </placeName>and <placeName>Poland</placeName>, it is to be hoped. In
consequence <persName>immigrants </persName>are thronging to this <placeName>country</placeName>. Where can
they find such an asylum as <placeName>Texas </placeName>offers? How prophetic were
your views! With you, I am heartily sick of the <placeName>old world</placeName> and all
its doings&#8212;the great tyrannies and the little ones. Pray be firm
against slavery. I witness such cruelties as fill me with abhorrence
<hi rend="italic">of myself</hi> and my species. How I long for our peaceful and simple
and quiet life, where we will admit no debasing passions. I will
not aim at too much and I can not be disappointed. My personal
wants are few. My plan for a <placeName>school </placeName>is drawn up, but at the present
it shall remain in my escritoire.</p>

<p>I can not forbear to give you an extract from a letter of <persName>Orville
Holley</persName> about my work. He says, " I intirely agree with you in your
appreciation of <persName>Stephen Fuller Austin</persName>'s character. He is to be
ranked among the <persName>founders of <placeName>Commonwealths</placeName></persName>, intrepid, 
interprizing, benevolent and just&#8212;a man of sense and soul. I am not only
pleased, but proud to be friendly and respectfully remembered by
such a man; and it will be among the many grateful considerations
connected with whatever I may be able to do in the matter of this
book, that it may serve in some degree to promote his just and sacred
interests." He says he has half a mind to emigrate himself, 
supposing he could fix in some <placeName>prairie</placeName>, where he could gather his own
eggs, and after learning the <hi rend="italic">bee business</hi> take his own honey etc., etc.</p>

<p>I mean to return here in <date n="10-xx-1832">October </date>when I will arrange the details
for further operations.    I can not now regulate everything, nor tell
the moment of my going to the <placeName>Colony</placeName>.    But I assure you, my [dear]
<persName>cousin</persName>, that it will be at the first moment I am able, for there is
nothing I so ardently long for&#8212;   In the mean time the happiness of
being once more with my dear <persName>children </persName>will absorb me.    If they
were in <placeName>Texas </placeName>and I with them, I should not have a wish.    My
health is very good.    May all happiness attend you&#8212;remember me
kindly to your <persName>sister </persName>and <persName>family</persName>.</p>
<p>Your <persName>cousin </persName>                                                                 </p>
<p><persName>M A H</persName></p>
<p><persName>Hubbard </persName>has his passport&#8212;He and <persName>John </persName>are well&#8212;</p>
<p>[Addressed:]<persName>Col: S F Austin</persName>   <placeName> San Felipe de Austin Texas.
