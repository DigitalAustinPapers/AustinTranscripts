<p><placeName>Matagorda </placeName><date when="1831-06-18">June the 18&#8212;1831</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir after my respects to you although an entire <persName>stranger</persName>
I have moved along way into your <placeName>Colony </placeName>from <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>by Land
by the way of the <placeName>Missouru State</placeName> and not being pleased with that
<placeName>country </placeName>I made my way with a <persName>wife </persName>and Eight <persName>Children </persName>six <persName>sons </persName>and
two <persName>daughters </persName>I made applycation at <placeName><persName>Mr. Williams</persName> office</placeName> for <placeName>League
no 10 on the west of the Colorado</placeName> <persName>Mr Wightman</persName> at that time
thought it was vacant but it was entered to<persName> Mr Norton</persName> Sir if
you can with any Degree of propriety Let me have the <persName>League of
Land no 11 on the West of the Colorado</persName> although it was reserved
by you for a <placeName>Governmental town</placeName> <persName>Mr Wightman</persName> thinks you 
mentioned to him as the <persName>Government </persName>had selected a <placeName>Cite on the Labaca
</placeName>and at <placeName>Galveston </placeName>for their <placeName>towns </placeName>that the <placeName>four reserved Leagues at
the mouth of this river</placeName> might be Entered, I mentioned this to
<persName>Mr Williams your Secretary</persName> <persName>Mr Williams </persName>thought perhaps you
might consent for me to have <placeName>no 11</placeName> as you Could attach another
League adjoining to<placeName> No 12- 13- and 14 </placeName>and Let me have <placeName>League no 11
</placeName>and <persName>Mr Williams</persName> Entered my name and League so it Stands for you
to approve or reject and as I have Bought Some <placeName>town lots</placeName> in this
place and will settle Here it would suit me well as I Could git 
timber from that by water. My trade is that of a <persName>Blacksmith </persName>and I will
also observe I am not wealthy but can say to you I Came to this
<placeName>Country </placeName>Clear of anything Debt or Bad fame and I have sold a
waggon I brought with me and am prepared to pay in to your <placeName>office</placeName>
the first installment besides settling the <persName>surveyor</persName>s fees and you will
much oblige me and not disoblige yourself by Letting me have the
<placeName>League </placeName>and my settling in this <placeName>country </placeName>will be no disadvantage
for If I am pleased with this <placeName>Country </placeName>a Good many more Good
<persName>Citizens </persName>will emigrate from <placeName>Kentucky </placeName>you will be good enough
to write me an answer by some <persName>safe hand</persName> so I will know what
Course to pursue If I Cannot be accomodated with that <placeName>League </placeName>I
Expect to go into <placeName>Dewits Colony</placeName> to be Suited in a League</p>
<p><persName>John T. Criswell</persName>.</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Coln Stephen F Austen</persName>   <placeName>San Philip Texas</placeName> favour by <persName>Mr Wightman</persName></p>
