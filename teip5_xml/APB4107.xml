<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1830-12-14">14 Decr 1830</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>I have the satisfaction of acknowledging the receipt of yours of <date when="1830-10-02">2d
October</date> from <placeName>New York</placeName>, and of informing you of the safe arrival
of the Nelson. I recd a letter <date when="1830-12-13">yesterday </date>from <persName>John Austin</persName> stating
that the Nelson was at <placeName>Brazoria </placeName>and he was then unloading your
goods&#8212;She lost her false keel coming over the <placeName>bar </placeName>and thumped
severely&#8212;the <placeName>bar </placeName>is much worse than when you came over&#8212;<persName>Henry
Austin</persName> came near loosing his Steam boat going out, he put to Sea
very much damaged and I have not heard of him since&#8212;</p>

<p>I wrote to <persName>John </persName>to follow your instructions strickly as to the goods,
and not open them untill <persName>Mr Hunter</persName> arrives.   I have not yet finished<pb n="556"/>
the <placeName>Store house</placeName>, it is raised (in this place) the Shingles are hawled&#8212;
the plank is all sawed and wagons have gone after it&#8212;So that I
hope it will be ready by the time <persName>Hunter </persName>arrives&#8212;I have no <placeName>house</placeName>
under way for the <persName>family</persName>&#8212;you will get out in the <date n="SPring-1831">Spring </date>and the
weather will be pleasant, and you can get along very well untill
some <placeName>buildings </placeName>are put up&#8212;<persName>Emily </persName>has seen a <placeName>new country</placeName> in times
long past and can manage very well for a month or two&#8212;The fact
is I have no one to attend to business and if I undertake to build
while I am absent it will cost ten prices. My advise is that you
build on the <placeName>out lots above <persName>Williams</persName></placeName>; in this place on the creek&#8212;-I
think the situation a healthy one-</p>

<p><persName>Edwards </persName>gets the <placeName>League at the point</placeName>-&#8212;There was no other way
of arranging the thing&#8212;-The <placeName>tract between the two creeks</placeName> I think
is the best <placeName>Stock farm</placeName> in the<placeName> lower country,</placeName> and I am clearly of
opinion that Stock is the best business that can be followed, and if
you intend to go into that business the <placeName>Clear Creek</placeName> and <placeName>Dickensons
Creek </placeName>is the best tract you can get&#8212;I am very anxious for you to
be here. We can soon fix ourselves comfortably&#8212;the <persName>family </persName>will
have to undergo some privations the first year I leave here the <date when="1830-12-16">day
after tomorrow </date>for <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and shall not be back untill <date n="06-xx-1831">June</date>, and I
then hope to see you all here in health&#8212;. I have left my will with
<persName>S. M. Williams </persName>and he has a power of attorney to attend to all my
business, there is considerable due me and you can get work and
plank etc. without paying money Also I wish you to begin 
collecting cattle due me&#8212;I think it will be a good plan to bring a <persName>mexican
family</persName> with me from <placeName>Saltillo</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I have heard nothing from <persName>Hunter </persName>and am very uneasy about
him&#8212;the <placeName>Brazos bar</placeName> is very dangerous <placeName>Galveston </placeName>must be the
<placeName>principal port</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>Call on <persName>Williams </persName>for any notes due me or all of them&#8212;and use
any thing of mine as if it was yours without any kind of reserve.
If I live through these two years, I am done for the balance of my
life with all kind of public matters</p>

<p>The person who takes this is waiting so I will close by wishing
you all a safe journey and good health</p>

<p>farewell</p>
                                            
<p> <persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James F. Perry</persName>  <placeName> Potosi   Missouri</placeName></p>
