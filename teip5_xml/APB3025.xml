<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> <date when="1825-10-28">Oct. 28th 1825</date>.</p>
<p>My Dr <persName>Sister</persName>,</p>

<p>I receivd your much esteemed favour of the <date when="1825-09-01">1 of Septr</date> in due
time, I am much pleased to hear of the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> aquisition you have
made to your <persName>family </persName>besides the personal gratification it is to myself
to have another <persName>Nephew</persName>&#8212;this letter will probably be handed you
by a <persName>Mr De Witt</persName> who has promised me he would call on you on his
way to the <placeName>upper part of the State</placeName>&#8212;he is one of the gentlemen who
have obtained permission to settle an additional number of <persName>families</persName>
in this <placeName>Department</placeName>&#8212;his <placeName>Grant </placeName>is on the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>River Guadalupe</placeName></hi>, <placeName>between
this and San Antonio</placeName>&#8212;there is a flattering prospect at this time of
this <placeName>Department</placeName> being shortly filled up by <persName>American Emigrants</persName>;
this Govt have authorized <placeName>four New Colonies</placeName> to be settled which
will be done immediately, <placeName>one lies above this on the Rivers Colorado and Brasos</placeName> which if settled will be a perfect safe guard to us
against the <persName>Indians</persName>&#8212;the other<placeName> 3 are East and <hi rend="italic">West</hi> of us</placeName>&#8212;so that
<placeName>this Colony will be nearly the center</placeName>&#8212;None of the <placeName>other Colonys</placeName>
are so rich in land as this. Neither have they such an <placeName>outlet </placeName>for
their produce as this&#8212;So that it is of much importance to us that
they should Settle as soon as possible&#8212;I have seen some Distressing
tales told of us in some of the <placeName>News Papers of the U. S.</placeName>&#8212;
particularly in the <placeName>Arkansas Gacette</placeName> that Paper has always evinced a<pb n="1230"/>
most <hi rend="italic">Deadly hatred</hi> towards the settlement of this <placeName>Colony</placeName> and its
"<hi rend="italic">Barking <persName>Editor</persName></hi>" catches from every <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> <persName>Buck Skin Scoundrel</persName>
that has been driven from the <placeName>Country</placeName> for his Villanous acts&#8212;
something to insert in his "<hi rend="italic">Invaluable repository</hi>" of <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">information</hi> to prevent any one from emigrating to this <placeName>Colony</placeName>&#8212;but
his admonition to the <persName>publick </persName>has a different effect from what he
wishes&#8212;for it only tends to keep <hi rend="italic">fools</hi> and men that are much better
in <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> than <hi rend="italic">here</hi> away Wise men and men useful to <persName>Society</persName>
pay no attention to him I think <persName>C. Ashley</persName> furnishes all the matter
he can procure against us&#8212;You must pay no attention to any tales
of this kind&#8212;</p>

<p>Crops are good notwithstanding that we had an unusual wet
Season <date n="Spring - 1825">last spring</date>, and some Overflow&#8212;I shall start <placeName>down the river</placeName>
in a few days to establish myself permanently We will build a
<placeName>Cotton Gin</placeName> as soon as possible; much cotton will be planted next
season <persName>Stephen</persName> begins to think of getting him a <persName>wife </persName>"dont" be
surprized to hear of the Event of Events sooner than you imagine.
I think if <persName>Stephen</persName> gives an Example I will promise to profit by it,
tho at this time I have no Idea of the kind&#8212;When I get down below
I shall not have so many opportunities to write you tho that must
be no excuse for you Write me often you can always find matter
that will be interesting to me, if you can find nothing else give me
a touch of the News of the day the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>mines </placeName>abound</hi> in it&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Stephen</persName> wrote you a few days since&#8212;and will write again by <persName>Mr.
De Witt</persName> Give my respects to <persName>Brother James</persName> with my congratulations on the recent Birth of a <persName>son</persName>&#8212;Kiss little <persName>Mary</persName> for me "dont"
let her forget me&#8212;tell <persName>Joel</persName> and <persName>Austin</persName> to study hard and be good
Boys&#8212;My respects to <persName>Mr. and Mrs. J Perry</persName> also to <persName>Mrs. Perry</persName>&#8212;all
my acquaintances generally&#8212;I refer you to <persName>Mr. Dewitt</persName> for all general information respecting the <placeName>Colony</placeName>-&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Mrs. Emily M Perry</persName></p>
