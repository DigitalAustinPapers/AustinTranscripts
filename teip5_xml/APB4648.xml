<p><placeName>Santarosa </placeName><date when="1834-06-10">June 10th 1834</date></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>believing yourself and family anxious to hear something direct
from <persName>Col Austin</persName>, I take the liberty of forwarding you such 
information as I have obtained.</p>

<p>I this day recd, a letter from <persName>Farther Muldoon</persName> dated <placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1834-05-14">May
14th</date>, respecting <persName>Austin</persName>, he writes as follows,--<pb n="1063"/></p>

<p>You have no doubt have known of <persName>Austin</persName>'s imprisonment in one
of the <placeName>dungeons of the Inquisition</placeName> since the <date n="02-xx-1834">beginning of february
</date><date n="06-xx-1834">until last week</date>, when he was put in communication, although I have
been to see him several times during the extreme rigor of his <placeName>prison</placeName>,
but to obtain this boon, to make use of Priestcraft was of absolute
necessity, the <persName>Vice President</persName> would have suffered him to rot there
without once offering him the remotest hope of his enlargement He
will soon enjoy the plentitude of liberty.</p>

<p>The <persName>farther </persName>says he has been living with the <persName>president </persName>since the
<date n="xx-xx-1834">commencement of the present year</date>, that he left his <placeName>country residence
</placeName>on the <date when="1834-04-17">17th of apl</date> owing to some new disturbances making their
appearences in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>and arived at the <placeName>capital </placeName>on the <date when="1834-04-23">23rd</date> and
again took charge of the reins of govt, he is of opinion all things will
become tranquil in a short time,&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>Sterling Robison agent of the Nashville Company</persName>, has obtained the
<placeName>coloney </placeName>granted to <persName>Austin and Williams</persName> in <date n="xx-xx-1832">1832</date>, I believe it cost a
bribe of about thirteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p><persName>Oliver Jones</persName></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>This letter was in closed to you in a letter Directed to <persName>Williamson</persName>
I now send you the letter as there is something respecting <persName>Uncle</persName>, I
wrote you <date when="1834-06-25">yesterday</date>. <persName>Roberson </persName>has got the <placeName>colony </placeName>but he has got it
by proveing lies by some <persName>interested individuals</persName>, but every thing that
has been done by<persName> Austin and Williams</persName> is respected and is to stand
good etc I think there will be some difficulty about it yet as they will
try to prove that <persName>Roberson </persName>had not the <persName>Hundred familys</persName> which he
has stated to the <persName>Government </persName>through the <persName>Ayuntameanto </persName>that he had
when the law of<date when="1840-04-06"> 6 April</date> was passed etc which prevented him from
fullfilling his contract etc</p>

<p><persName>M. A. B[ryan]</persName></p>

<p><placeName>Austin </placeName><date when="1834-05-26">June 26 1834</date></p>

<p>[Addressed] <persName>Mr. James F. Perry</persName> <placeName>Peach Point</placeName> politeness <persName>Doct
Shaw</persName></p>
