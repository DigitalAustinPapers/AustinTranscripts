<p><placeName>New York</placeName>, <date when="1836-05-04">May 4, 1836</date>.</p>

<p><persName>Hon. L. F. Linn</persName>:</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Yours of <date when="1836-05-01">1st. instant</date> I received to-day on my return from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,
(where I went, at the solicitation of a <persName>committee </persName>from there,) in 
conjunction with my <persName>colleagues</persName>, <placeName>Archer </placeName>and <placeName>Wharton</placeName>, to attend a <placeName>Texas </placeName>meeting
on the <date when="1836-05-02">2d</date>.</p>

<p>I presume you have seen in the <placeName>Philadelphia papers</placeName> the result of the
meeting&#8212; (see the <placeName>Pennsylvania Inquirer</placeName>, <placeName>U. S. Gazette,</placeName> <placeName>Ledger</placeName>, etc.) It
was very enthusiastic and ardent in the cause of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and was held in a<pb n="345"/>
<placeName>wing of that Temple of Liberty</placeName> where, in <date n="xx-xx-1776">'76</date>, those principles were 
proclaimed which have ever since been a beacon-light to the benighted and
enslaved of <placeName>all nations</placeName>. The <hi rend="italic">spirit </hi>of <date n="xx-xx-1776">'76</date> was there. <hi rend="italic">That </hi>spirit, and <hi rend="italic">hearts</hi>
of the vast multitude, told them what to do. No cold or selfish influence of
policy or of party cast its chilling breath over that meeting.</p>

<p>You ask me what can be done in favor of <placeName>Texas</placeName>? Ask your heart, my
<persName>friend </persName>and <persName>fellow-citizen</persName>, (for such you are in feeling, although an 
invisible line separates our domicils&#8212; ask the noble spirit of your and my
<persName>fathers</persName>&#8212; ask every <persName>freeman</persName>, every <persName>philanthropist on earth</persName>&#8212; ask every man
<hi rend="italic">who is not a <persName>politician</persName></hi>, and who acts from the warm and honest impulses
of a patriotic heart, and you will receive a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>A war of extermination is raging in <placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;a war of barbarism and of
despotic principles, waged by the <persName>mongrel Spanish-Indian</persName> and <persName>Negro </persName>race,
against civilization and the <persName>Anglo-American</persName> race.</p>

<p>For fifteen years I have been laboring like a slave to <hi rend="italic">Americanize</hi>
<placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;to form a nucleus around which my <persName>native countrymen</persName> could 
collect and grow into a solid body that would forever be a barrier of safety
to the <placeName>southwestern frontier</placeName>, and especially to the outlet of the <placeName>western
world</placeName>&#8212;the <placeName>mouth of the Mississippi</placeName>&#8212;and which would be a beacon-light
to the <persName>Mexicans </persName>in their search after liberty.</p>

<p>But the <persName>Anglo-American</persName> foundation, this nucleus of republicanism, is to
be broken up, and its place supplied by a population of <persName>Indians</persName>, <persName>Mexicans</persName>,
and <persName>renegadoes</persName>, all mixed together, and all the natural enemies of white
men and civilization.</p>

<p>What I have been the means of effecting towards the Americanism of
<placeName>Texas</placeName>, is of more real service to the protection of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, and
<placeName>Missouri</placeName>, than the expenditure of <hi rend="italic">thirty millions of dollars</hi> on the 
fortifications of that <placeName>frontier</placeName>; yes, more than a standing army of <persName>10,000 men
</persName>there would be; and yet it is to be broken up, because the <persName>people of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>
have too much of the spirit of their fathers to lay down beneath the feet of
military despotism, and debase and damn their blood and their education;
it is to be broken up, because it will not do for the <persName><placeName>United States</placeName> 
government</persName> to interfere with a usurper, a base, unprincipled, bloody monster,
who sets the laws of civilization and of humanity at defiance, who 
desolates <placeName>Texas </placeName>under the bloody flag of a <persName>pirate</persName>, and whose avowed intention
is to excite the <persName>Indians </persName>and <persName>negroes</persName>, and crimson the waters of the 
<placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, and make it the eastern boundary of Mexico, (for such an intention
has been avowed.) No. This <persName>monster </persName>cannot be interfered with, because
a treaty was made with the <placeName>federal republic of Mexico</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">which republic no
longer exists.</hi></p>

<p>Oh! spirit of our fathers, where are you? Just and omnipotent God,
where is thy influence? Where is the fatherly care and protection of a wise<pb n="346"/>
and watchful government that applies <hi rend="italic">cheap </hi>and <hi rend="italic">prompt </hi>preventives 
beforehand, in preference to the expenditure of <hi rend="italic">millions </hi>for remedies, after an
evil has occurred?</p>

<p>But you ask, What <hi rend="italic">preventive </hi>can be applied? The answer is plain&#8212;Let
an <persName>army of the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName> march into <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and say to the pirate <persName>Santa
Anna</persName>, "Stop:" a great and philanthropic and <persName>free people</persName> will not stand
tamely by and see justice, constitutional right, and humanity, wantonly
violated at her door&#8212;nor can a paternal government tolerate a state of
things on its most vulnerable and important <placeName>frontier</placeName>, that will, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
bring the bloody tide of savage war and the horrors of <persName>negro </persName>insurrection
within its limits.</p>

<p>It is madness and folly&#8212;it is deceiving yourselves and your constituents
to believe that the <placeName>Texas </placeName>war is not a war of extermination against 
<hi rend="italic"><persName>Anglo-Americans</persName></hi> and <hi rend="italic">their principles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">interests</hi>. The <persName>republican party in
<placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName> are now subdued and crushed: they, by their own acts and 
misplaced confidence in <persName>Santa Anna</persName>, have put the sword into <hi rend="italic">his </hi>hands to cut
their own throats. He has acquired all his power by deceiving the <persName>federal
republican party of <placeName>Mexico</placeName></persName>, and by making blind instruments of them. He
is now continuing the same policy, for he has united all the influence and
resources of <hi rend="italic">that party</hi> against <placeName>Texas</placeName>. <hi rend="italic">He </hi>and the <hi rend="italic"><persName>monarchial party</persName></hi> now in
power, who have overturned the federal constitution of <date n="xx-xx-1834">1824</date>, know very well
that to expect any thing like tranquility, or even comparative security in the
enjoyment of their usurpations, they must keep out <hi rend="italic"><persName>Anglo-American </persName>
republicanism</hi>, and stop the <hi rend="italic">moral invasion</hi> that was spreading over the <placeName>eastern
and internal states (now military provinces) of Mexico</placeName>. How is this to be
done? By exterminating the <persName>American population in <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName>, and filling that
country with <persName>Indians </persName>and <persName>negroes</persName>, who (as he thinks) will form an 
impenetrable barrier from the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName> to the <placeName>Rio del Norte</placeName>, and thus restore
the old Spanish policy, which was <hi rend="italic">"to prevent even a bird from crossing
the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName> if possible"</hi></p>

<p>And the <persName><placeName>United States</placeName> Government</persName> are to stand by with its hands folded,
over <hi rend="italic">scruples </hi>about interposing in the holy cause of humanity, philanthropy,
of liberty, and of protection to its own exposed <placeName>frontier</placeName>! Oh! I cannot&#8212;do
not&#8212;will not believe it. Of one thing <hi rend="italic">I am certain</hi>, the people, the <persName>freemen
of this <placeName>nation</placeName></persName>, <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> permit, nor will they tolerate the barbarities and
usurpations of a <persName>Mexican tyrant</persName>. No&#8212;they will obey the dictates of their
hearts, and fly to the rescue of their <persName>countrymen </persName>and of free principles.
They will, of their own accord, save the bulwark of the whole <placeName>Southwestern
frontier</placeName>, and <placeName>Arkansas </placeName>from the greatest peril that has ever threatened any
portion of the <placeName>United States territory</placeName> since it became a nation. I do not
mean the peril of <persName>Mexican </persName>invasion&#8212;it would be an insult to the <persName>people of
the <placeName>United States</placeName></persName> to <hi rend="italic">call </hi>that a peril&#8212; I mean the peril of an <persName>Indian </persName>and<pb n="347"/>
servile war&#8212;the murder of <persName>women </persName>and <persName>children</persName>, and the loss to civilization (at least for some time) of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>I have seen the communication you speak of in the ****. That 
<placeName>newspaper </placeName>seems to lean towards scruples, or party interests, or perhaps to 
<persName>Mexican </persName>influence. I do not read or look at any papers of that character. I am,
however, willing to believe that they do not properly understand the 
ORIGIN, PRINCIPLES and OBJECTS of the <placeName>Texas </placeName>war, and are acting under
<hi rend="italic">Mistaken views,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">not from want of principle, or even the common 
impulses of justice and humanity.</hi></p>

<p>I must, however, say that it looks very badly for men to condemn a whole
people who are struggling for <hi rend="italic">self-preservation</hi>, before they understand the
subject, and analyze it sufficiently to judge of its Moral as well as Political
merits.</p>

<p>Let such men take up the history of <persName>Mexican </persName>misrule in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and all
over <placeName>Mexico</placeName>; let them inquire into the present state of things in that 
important nation; let them ascertain whether the present consolidated 
despotism which exists there, has or has not been established by <hi rend="italic">revolutionary
means</hi>, by <hi rend="italic">force, fraud,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violence</hi>; whether the federal social compact of
<placeName>Mexico</placeName>, to which the <persName>People of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> bound their allegiance, is not illegally
dissolved; whether the <persName>People of <placeName>Texas</placeName></persName> did or did not oppose this illegal
dissolution of their <persName>Government</persName>, as they were bound by their oaths to do,
and whether they did not grimly adhere to THEIR duty and obligations as
<persName>Mexican citizens</persName>, under the Constitution, so long as it existed. Let them
read an exposition of the <placeName>Texas </placeName>war, made by me at <placeName>Louisville, Kentucky</placeName>,
on <date when="1836-03-07">7th March last</date>, that made in this city by <persName>W. H. Wharton, Esq</persName>. on the
<date when="1836-04-26">26th ult</date>. and other documents on this subject. In short, let them 
<hi rend="italic">understand</hi> the question, before they attempt to approve or condemn, and I am
confident they can form but ONE OPINION, which is, that the <persName>Texians </persName>are
RIGHT, and that under similar circumstances all <persName>freemen </persName>ought to, and
would have done as they have.</p>

<p>An expression of opinion in <persName>Congress</persName>, or by the Executive favorable to
<hi rend="italic">the cause of <placeName>Texas</placeName></hi>, would settle this matter and end this war; it would be a
<hi rend="italic">preventive </hi>which will cost nothing, and violate no treaty or other obligation,
no more than the Greek Revolution did; <hi rend="italic">and it will save the expenditure of
millions hereafter, and the loss of thousands of lives.</hi> It will do this, 
because such an expression of opinion would inspire confidence, and thus open
the ice-bound chests of <persName>money lenders</persName>, and enable <placeName>Texas </placeName>to procure funds.
Men she can get in thousands. The <placeName>chivalrous <hi rend="italic">West</hi></placeName>, and the <placeName>warm-hearted,
high-souled <hi rend="italic">South </hi></placeName>will furnish them; but they must be fed and provided
with arms and ammunition, etc.</p>

<p>Pardon me for occupying so much of your time by so long a letter; my
heart and soul, my all, and, as I think, the best interests of my <placeName>native 
country</placeName>, and the great principles of liberty, are deeply involved in this subject.<pb n="348"/>
I have, in times past, had more kind and charitable feelings for the 
<persName>Mexicans </persName>in general, and have been much more faithful to them than they
merited. I acted from a sound and honest principle&#8212;that of mutually 
benefiting my native and <placeName>adopted country</placeName>, by <hi rend="italic">Americanizing </hi><placeName>Texas </placeName>and securing
to liberal principles in <placeName>Mexico </placeName>a <hi rend="italic">support </hi>and a <hi rend="italic">guide </hi>in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and at the
same time serving my native country by a population there, that would 
harmonize with their neighbors. But sad and dear bought experience has 
convincd me that it is in vain to hope for any good from <persName>Mexican </persName>institutions,
or <persName>Mexican </persName>justice. I am, therefore,<hi rend="italic"> for the independence of <placeName>Texas</placeName></hi>, and I
am so from the soundest principles that move the human heart&#8212;those of
<hi rend="italic">liberty, justice, humanity</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">self-preservation</hi>.</p>

<p>Respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>.</p>
