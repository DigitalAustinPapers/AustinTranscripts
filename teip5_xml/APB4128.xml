<p><placeName>Austin</placeName>, <date when="1831-01-08">Jan. 8, 1831</date></p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your seeming unwillingness to converse on the subject I named
to you this <date when="1831-01-08">morning</date>, prevented my saying to you all I had intended
on the subject of my petition to <persName>Govt </persName>for an augmentation of <placeName>land</placeName>.<pb n="581"/>
My reasons for my intended petition is not a mere idle whim, it is
because I was amongst the first who emigrated to the <placeName>country</placeName>, It
will shortly be eight years since I made the <placeName>country </placeName>my home. At
that time, and nearly ever since, I have been engaged in a business,
altogether profitable to the <placeName>community</placeName>, and for many reasons well
known to yourself, it has been quite the contrary to myself. I lost
all my property that was of value to me at my first landing, to
the amt. of upwards of $500.</p>

<p>The business I have followed could not be profitable to me, until
the <placeName>country </placeName>should flourish, in consequence of which my last
seven years has been spent in a labour, that is hard and rough, living
in the woods, during all of which time, I have been saving and
economical, and at this moment find myself not only poor, but
largely in debt.</p>

<p>I have therefore thought, that as the <placeName>country </placeName>has been proffitted
by the business I have followed, and has been of public utility,
that it might entitle me to a claim on the <placeName>country</placeName>, for a 
remuneration of the losses I have sustained in her services. I wish no extra
acquisition of <placeName>lands </placeName>unless I merit them, and whether I do or not,
depends on the reasons above stated, all of which, comes within
your knowledge.</p>
