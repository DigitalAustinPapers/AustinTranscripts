<p>My dear Sir</p>

<p>I embrace the opportunity by <persName>Mr. Treat</persName> to drop you a line, I am
very anxious to see you but that is impracticable at present. The
state of things in <placeName>Texas </placeName>is I fear rather critical, and such as to 
require very great prudence on the part of the <persName>public Officers</persName> and
especially in the military and revenue departments. The revenue
regulations made by <persName>Fisher</persName>, as to their views are utterly 
impracticable and their execution is impossible. The <persName>Officer at the<placeName> mouth
of the River</placeName> </persName> has done his duty, so far as it was possible, I found
that a Flame was Kindling which if not checked would very soon
have removed the <persName>guard </persName>from this <placeName>River </placeName>and it would then have
spread and soon reached <placeName>Anahuac </placeName>and <persName>Mr. Fisher</persName>.   The conse-<pb n="732"/>
quences you can imagine. You know your <persName>native countrymen</persName> and
you also know that at this time the <persName>people in <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>have just causes
and very many of them to complain. In this state of things, I
wrote to the <persName>officer at the<placeName> mouth of the River</placeName></persName> and told him what the
true state of things was. My advise is to let this <placeName>River </placeName>alone and
let things go on as they now are, and as I indicated in my letter to
<persName>Domínguez</persName>, I cannot understand the policy that is pursued as to
<placeName>Texas </placeName>if you understand it I wish you would explain it to me. This
is no time for ambiguity, for it will require all our management
united to keep things quiet unless a more Liberal System is adopted
towards the people. As we are now situated the <placeName>country </placeName>will be
totally broken up and all commerce totally annihilated. Is that the
object of the Government&#8212;if it is I wish to know it. This <persName>Govt</persName>
never had a firmer <persName>friend </persName>than I have been, do I merit or does the
<persName>people of my <placeName>colony</placeName></persName> merit to be shut out from the <placeName>whole world</placeName> and
have all their commerce destroyed.   I think not.</p>

<p>Please let me hear from you on this subject.</p>
