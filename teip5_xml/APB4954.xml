<p><placeName>Goliad </placeName><date when="1835-10-15">Oct. 15&#8212;1835</date></p>
<p>8. in the morning</p>
<p>To <persName>Genl. S F Austin<lb/>
Com. in Ch. of the army of the people,</persName></p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I dispatch this by <persName>J. A. Padilla</persName>, With a <persName>Small detachment of Creole
troops</persName>. These may be made very useful perhaps, if retained as 
<persName>expresses</persName>&#8212;and are placed at Your disposal. The <persName>broken battallion</persName> 
organized here on the arrival of <persName>Capt Smith</persName> and <persName>Alley</persName>, became disaffected 
<date when="1835-10-14">Yesterday </date>and dissolved. This event, together with the consent of <persName>Capt Alley</persName>,
leaves me in command of <placeName>this post</placeName>.</p>

<p>I am <hi rend="italic">satisfactorily </hi>informed that there are at the <placeName>Cantonement on the
Nueces</placeName>, 3 ps Small Brass Cann. a considerable supply of arms and 
amunition, and a Valuable Caballada, and only <persName>30 or 40 men</persName>. I Suggest the
propriety of reducing this <placeName>post</placeName>. It will give security to the <placeName>frontier</placeName>,
Supply us with some important means of defence, Strike a panic and 
encourage the counter revolution <placeName>in the interior</placeName> and if a dash were made on
<placeName>Matamoras </placeName>the Stroke&#8212;might be followed by the most important 
consequence to the present and future repose of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>

<p>My individual <hi rend="italic">means </hi>and services are at the disposal of my <placeName>adopted
country</placeName>, to free <placeName>Texas </placeName>of an <persName>armed Soldiery</persName>.</p>

<p>The <persName>Detachment </persName>which goes with <persName>Padilla </persName>is commanded by <persName>Sen Placido
Venevedas</persName>.</p>

<p><persName>Doct. Baylor</persName> goes with them, and can give you much important 
information He is a <persName>gentleman</persName>, and a <persName>soldier </persName>was in action at the Storm of
this <placeName>post</placeName>, and behaved bravely</p>

<p><persName>Capt. Collinsworth</persName> has returned to <placeName>Bay Prairie</placeName>' for more men. A <hi rend="italic">few</hi>
are expected here to day from <placeName><persName>Power</persName>'s Colony</placeName> below this.</p>

<p><persName>Padilla </persName>and <persName>Placido Venevedas</persName> are in favor of receiving the <persName>privates</persName>,
Captured here, into our service&#8212;But I am afraid; Your order on this 
subject, however, as on all others, herein submitted, are solicited; and every
<pb n="186"/>
exertion will be made, which depends on me, and on those under my 
<hi rend="italic">immediate </hi>command, to execute them.</p>

<p>Amongst those who took possession of this <placeName>fort</placeName>, there has been no 
dissenting, no dissatisfaction; they all have acted, and still act, in concert. It
is greatly to be regreted that this is not the case in every instance, Every
effort should be made by all, but more especially by those of the <persName>staff</persName>, to
keep dissention out of our <placeName>camps</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>P. Dimitt Capt.</persName></p>
