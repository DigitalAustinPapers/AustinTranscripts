<p><date when="1830-12-19">Decr. 19 [18] 30</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName></p>

<p>I wrote you a day or so since and improve another opportunity&#8212;
your goods by the Nelson arrived safe <persName>John Austin</persName> came up
<date when="1830-12-18">yesterday </date>and had stored them all up in good order&#8212; Nothing
will be opened untill <persName>Hunter </persName>arrives-&#8212; I shall have to use up some
of the nails to finish the <placeName>store house</placeName>- I have all the Shingles and
all the weather boarding on the ground the plank for the [mutilated]
and the sheeting for the roof will [be ready in] a few days. The
frame is up so that [the building will be] all ready by the time
<persName>Hunter </persName>arrives he can get the goods up&#8212; I think a small 
assortment of goods would do at the <placeName>Mouth of Trinity</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I am very anxious for you to get here, I shall be as poor as I
now am without you, as long as I live&#8212; I need some one to take
care of my money matters, and I w[ant you] to take all the Stock
I can collect and manage the whole of that business&#8212; I think that
you had better build <placeName>on the lots of mine above <persName>Williams </persName>on the
Creek</placeName>, or if you prefer <placeName>town </placeName>I have a <placeName>whole square fronting on
the South west side of <hi rend="italic">Constitution </hi>Square&#8212;</placeName>or you can get out <placeName>lots
and building lots from the <persName>Ayto </persName></placeName>do as you please in this matter and
use my <placeName>lots </placeName>if you want them&#8212;- The <placeName>League of land above town</placeName>, is
mine, there are fine situations on it for a <placeName>stock farm</placeName> it is nearly all
<placeName>prairie</placeName>, only timber for fire wood. I have bought the <placeName><persName>Dickenson</persName>
League on Clear Creek</placeName>, for you if you want it&#8212;the title is in my
name, but if I die before I get back you will get it in another way,
<hi rend="italic">my will</hi>&#8212; I have appointed <persName>you and Lessasier and Williams my
executors&#8212;</persName>the first is a <persName>Lawyer </persName>and can be use full in [settlin]g
the estate and <persName>Williams </persName>knows more about my affairs than any
body else&#8212; you see I have made my arrangements as tho I expect
to die, but I hope to see you all here next summer every man ought
to make his will when in good health as all are liable to acc[iden]ts.</p>

<p>I have written to <persName>Col. Piedras </persName>at <placeName>Nacogdoches </placeName>that you will be
on&#8212;you must call and see him and shew your passport from me and
report your <hi rend="italic"><persName>servants</persName></hi>&#8212; Some have had the imprudence to tell
him that they had <persName>Slaves</persName>&#8212; you must indenture them, do it before
a <persName>magistrate</persName>, or <persName>clerk of a court</persName> or of [mutilated] <persName>witness </persName>let 
<persName>Hunter </persName>be out . . . and others who are ... so that .. . &#8212;the contract
here I think of [will] have no difficulty but be particular to call
on <persName>Col Piedras</persName> immediately on your arrival, get <persName>John Durst as
interpreter</persName> or some other<persName>&#8212;Col Bean</persName> [if he] is there&#8212;or <persName>Sterne</persName>-
the last person named is the best, tho any of them will do, they all
understand Spanish&#8212;<pb n="565"/></p>


<p>I leave <date when="1830-12-19">this day</date> for <placeName>Saltillo </placeName>and do not expect to be back before
<date n="06-xx-1831">June</date>, and to that time I look forward with great anxiety as the
period of meeting you all once more</p>

<p>The note you sent me on <persName>Sims </persName>is in the <placeName>bottom of my red trunk
</placeName>in one of your letters&#8212; farewell may heaven bless you and <persName>Emily</persName>
and the <persName>Children </persName>and give you a safe and pleasant journey here</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName>    [Rubric]</p>

<p>If you come by <placeName>Little Rock</placeName> get <persName>Father</persName>s writing desk I want it
because it was his</p>

<p><persName>S. F. A</persName>.</p>
<p>[Addressed:] <persName>Mr James Perry </persName> <placeName> Potosi   Missouri</placeName></p>
