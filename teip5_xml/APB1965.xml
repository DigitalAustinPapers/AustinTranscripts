<p><placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName><date when="1830-06-16"> June 16 1830</date></p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>You have no doubt seen published in the <placeName>news papers of the
United States,</placeName> the law of the <date when="1830-04-06">6th of April last</date> passed by the 
<persName>Mexican Congress </persName>relative to foreign emigration and other matters.
The 10th article of that law declares that no variation shall be
made <placeName>in those colonies already established.</placeName> My <placeName>colony </placeName>is 
established, and no legal impediment will of course be interposed to the
removal to it of those who have contracted to become <persName>settlers</persName>; for
they properly belong to the <placeName>colony </placeName>as much as those who are here.</p>

<p>The law requires that passports should be brought by the 
<persName>emigrants </persName>from a <persName>Mexican consul</persName>, and this must be done&#8212; The 
government has ordered most positively that the 13th article of the
State constitution shall be rigidly inforced, and I am of the opinion
that <placeName>Texas </placeName>will never become a <placeName>Slave state or country</placeName>. I will be
candid with you on this point, and say that I hope it never may.</p>

<p>You will recollect that the 13th Article above alluded to is in
these words&#8212; No person shall be born a <persName>slave in this <placeName>state</placeName></persName>, after
the publication of this constitution in the <placeName>capital of each district,</placeName><pb n="422"/>
and <date when="1830-10-06">six months after the publication of this constitution,</date> the 
introduction of <persName>Slaves </persName>shall not be permitted under any pretext. The
constitution was published in <date n="05-xx-1827">may 1827</date>. Since then the 
legislature has passed a law guaranteeing contracts, (not contrary to the
laws of this state) made in<placeName> foreign countries</placeName>, so as to permit 
<persName>families </persName>to bring the necessary and indispensable <persName>house servants</persName> and
<persName>labourers</persName>. This provision will be highly useful to the <placeName>country</placeName>
without the least danger of doing any harm for no one will be
willing to risk a large capital in <persName>negroes </persName>under contracts with them,
for they are free on their arrival here, and can only be held to
labour by contracts, as <persName>servants </persName>are all over this <placeName>nation</placeName>, and in
<placeName>other free countries</placeName>.</p>

<p>In the commencement of this <placeName>settlement</placeName>, I was in favour of the
limited admission of <persName>slaves</persName>&#8212;- My reasons were, the difficulty of 
procuring <persName>hands </persName>in the beginning for the necessary purposes of farming,
and the necessity of holding out inducements that <persName>slaves </persName>might be
brought, in order to give the settlement a start, and to draw 
emigration, a truly difficult thing to do at that time. It was an up-hill
business to get a <placeName>settlement </placeName>under way by any means, in the midst of
an entire <placeName>wilderness </placeName>infested with hostile <persName>Indians</persName>. The reasons for a
partial toleration of this evil, have now ceased, and the true 
prosperity and happiness of <placeName>Texas </placeName>require; that an everlasting bar should
be interposed to the farther introduction of <persName>slaves</persName>. Those already in
the country, are to be <persName>slaves </persName>for life, unless purchased by 
government, and freed in that way. This is just&#8212;-for the law permitted
their introduction. Their <persName>descendants </persName>are, of course, free&#8212; 
Measures have been taken to exclude<persName> free negroes</persName> and <persName>Mullatoes</persName>, not 
<persName>indented servants</persName>; so that there is no danger of being crowded with
that class, which is probably a worse nuisance than <persName>slaves</persName>. I cannot
believe that any reflecting man, either in <placeName>Texas </placeName>or out of it, can
seriously wish that slavery should be entailed upon this <placeName>country</placeName>.</p>

<p>To those who do not reflect, I would say, u take your pen-&#8212;put
down the number of <persName>slaves </persName>now in the <placeName>slave states</placeName>&#8212;calculate their
increase for eighty years at the known ratio of augmentation&#8212; 
Calculate the extent of <placeName>country </placeName>to which they are, and must be confined,
and its capacity to support human beings&#8212;- Then calculate the
number of<persName> white population</persName> and their increase-&#8212;deduct from said
increase, the emigration of <persName>whites </persName>to other <placeName>countries</placeName>; (no such 
deduction can be made from the increase of <persName>blacks</persName>, for they cannot 
emigrate,) compare the two sums, and then suppose that you will be
alive at the period above mentioned, that you have a long-cherished
and beloved <persName>wife</persName>, a number of <persName>daughters</persName>, <persName>grand daughters</persName>, and
<persName>great grand daughters</persName>;&#8212;would no fears for their fate, a horrible
fate; intrude themselves upon your pillow, and overcloud the evening
of your life???&#8212;<pb n="423"/></p>

<p>If <placeName>Texas </placeName>is wisely and prudently managed, it will be saved from
the overwhelming ruin which mathematical demonstration declares
must overtake the <placeName>slave states</placeName>; and the <persName>white population</persName> will find
within the <persName>Mexican </persName>limits a refuge; without being driven to the
<placeName>frozen regions of the north</placeName>. To talk to some of the<persName> slave holders</persName>
about justice, humanity, etc, would be talking to a<persName> deaf man</persName>, but I
will not believe that any one can look on the future which the above
calculation presents, without shuddering&#8212;</p>

<p>The law of the <date when="1830-04-06">6th of April</date> gives permission to foreign vessels
to engage in the <placeName>Coasting trade</placeName> from the <placeName>colonies </placeName>to the <placeName>ports of
Matamoras and Tampico and Vera Cruz</placeName>. It also admits all kind of
provisions and lumber, free of duty, into the ports of <placeName>Matagorda </placeName>and
<placeName>Galveston</placeName>, for two years. No duties of any kind will be collected,
except tonage, until after the expiration of the law of <date n="xx-xx-1823">1823</date>, 
exempting <placeName>Texas </placeName>from duties for seven years from its publication in the
<placeName>Capital of Texas</placeName>&#8212;   It will expire in<date n="11-xx-1830"> November next</date>.&#8212;</p>

<p>You will be pleased to communicate the contents of this letter to
the <persName>emigrants </persName>who have contracted to remove to this <placeName>colony </placeName>from
your <placeName>neighbourhood</placeName>.</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin </persName>   [Rubric]</p>

<p>To <persName>Mess. Richd Ellis</persName> <persName>Geo. Sutherland</persName> <persName>Anthony Winston</persName> <persName>R. R.
Royal,</persName> etc etc&#8212;                                                                 </p>

<p>The <persName>colonists in <placeName>Texas </placeName></persName>have been well and munificently treated by
this Gvt and are satisfied and contented with their situation&#8212; the
most undisturbed harmony and tranquility prevails through out all
<placeName>Texas</placeName>&#8212;<persName> Genl Teran</persName> is shortly expected on here with some <persName>troops</persName>
and some <persName>evil minded persons</persName> have circulated reports that his object
is to oppress the <persName>colonists</persName>&#8212; Those reports are without any real
foundation in truth, and have no effect here, but as rumor flies on the
wings of the wind it may waft them to you&#8212;but pay no attention
to them&#8212; those who bring their <persName>families </persName>here, and can produce
evidence that they belong to a contract on colonization which is in
legal opperation, and who can also bring unequivocal evidences of
good character, have nothing to fear&#8212;</p>
