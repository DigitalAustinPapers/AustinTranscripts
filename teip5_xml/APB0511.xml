<p><placeName>Mexico </placeName><date when="1822-05-22">May 22 1822</date></p>
<p>Dr <persName>Brother</persName>,</p>

<p>I have been here since the <date when="1822-04-29">29th of April</date> but my business is not yet
finished, it is before <persName>Congress </persName>and I am told will soon be dispatched&#8212;
Some great events have transpired since my arrival here, and this
great city is now in a State of Commotion and rejoicing&#8212; on the
<date when="1822-05-17">17</date> the <persName>Generalissimo Iturbide</persName> resigned, and sent his resignation
to <persName>Congress</persName>, this produced much sensation, which broke out on the<pb n="518"/>
night of the <date when="1822-05-18">18</date>, by firing of Musketry and cannon in the air loaded
with Balls, and loud Shouts from the <persName>Soldiers </persName>and <persName>Citizens </persName>
proclaiming <persName>Iturbide </persName><persName>Emperor </persName>under the title of <persName>Augustin 1st</persName>&#8212; the
next day the <persName>Congress </persName>met at 7 and at 12 elected <persName>Iturbide Emperor</persName>,
this was <date when="1822-05-19">Sunday</date>, on <date when="1822-05-20">Monday </date>the form of the oath was agreed on
and on <date when="1822-05-21">Tuesday </date>which was yesterday it was administered in 
<placeName>Congress Hall</placeName> by the <persName>President </persName>amidst the Shouts of the Multitude,
this day has been a constant scene of rejoicing, the <persName>army </persName>paraded
and the Bells have kept a constant roar since daylight&#8212; I hope
this event will be a fortunate one for the Country, the <persName>Emperor </persName>I 
believe is a very good man as well as a great one, and has the happiness
of the <placeName>nation </placeName>much at heart&#8212; I shall return as soon as I can, but
it is uncertain when that will be, everything is now at a stand, my
prospect[s] are very good and I think everything will be right&#8212;
you must keep closely to your studies and learn the language as
soon as possible&#8212; Should you hear anything of the vessel <persName>Mr
Little</persName> has charge of the cargo and you must aid him to sell the
articles for cash or mules&#8212; the Trunks keep safe until I arrive,
there are some things in one of them for the <persName>Govr </persName>and his <persName>Lady</persName>&#8212;</p>

<p>I was so unfortunate as not to see the <persName>Baron [de Bastrop]</persName>, he left
here early in the morning after I arrived I called at his lodgings not
more than half an hour after he had started give my respects to
him&#8212; You must conduct yourself very <hi rend="italic">prudently </hi>and attend to
your studies and to <hi rend="italic">Religion </hi>(sic), there are some dark clouds
hanging over this part of the <placeName>Country</placeName>, many are dissatisfied and
disappointed at the election of <persName>Iturbide</persName>, and the <persName>Republican party</persName>
is still restless tho I hope there will be no difficulty, but I fear it
much, I have wrote you since I arrived here and given some account
of this <placeName>city</placeName>&#8212; it is truly a large and splendid place, Something
larger than <placeName>N. York</placeName> and more splendidly built&#8212; but the people
are greatly behind the <placeName>U. S</placeName> in everything&#8212;</p>

<p>farewell I wrote to <persName>Bryan </persName>and <persName>Mother </persName>from here by a Gentleman
going to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>&#8212;</p>

<p><persName>S. F. Austin</persName></p>
