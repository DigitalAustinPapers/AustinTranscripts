who dare not oppose you when <placeName>In the Field</placeName>, will you sacrifice <placeName>Texas </placeName>and
the Fame you have already won for the sake of a little momentary comfort,
will you forsake the <placeName>fine settlements to the West (Guadaloupe and La
Vaca.)</placeName> only for the sake of a little Respite from the Inclemency of the
approaching <date n="Winter - 1835">winter</date>, thereby giving the <persName>Enemy </persName>confidence in themselves
and a contempt for us. We cannot believe it. You are still <persName>Americans</persName>
and will sustain your character as such Gentlemen and Friends. If you
desert <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> you will almost Ruin, <placeName>Texas</placeName>. As for comforts you shall
want for none Wagons are <placeName>on the Road</placeName> with Corn meal shugar, coffee
